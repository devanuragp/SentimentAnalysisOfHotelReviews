# SentimentAnalysisOfHotelReviews

To implement this project you just need to download the full_code.py, dataset, positive and 
negative reviews text files in a directory on your computer/laptop.

Create a new folder inside that directory named "pickled_files" and go back to the directory.

Then you'll have to open the full code file and update the file location 
according to your pc in the "Loading data" and "applyling model to your dataset" section.
