 for us the location and price were excellent we play baseball for london mets whose field is directly across the road so stating regularly means we need vfm so the location is great as i could eat my continental breakfast whilst watching the baseball out of the window the room was good for a mum and two boys it has a double and a sofa bed both of which were very comfy the kitchen area had everything we needed and as sainsbury s is only round the corner we were able to easily stock up on milk and cereal etc so the boys could eat early the room did smell a little musty when we first arrived but after an hour or so with the window open it soon went

 the room was comfortable and a good size for adventurous travelers what i mean is it is a good base and place to sleep for travelers that like to get out and about and spend most of the time outside of the hotel the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was just fine as well the location a hundred meters or so from a metro station was great because the hotel is just outside of the busy and more expensive part of the city but with easy access to everything via metro there is a cheaper breakfast offer instead of the standard 18 breakfast this one is 8 5 and includes a coffee croissant and a juice i think

 after a very warm welcome we were shown to our suite room this was most tastefully decorated without any naff art on the walls and thankfully without the unnecessary range of useless extra small cushions propped up against the two main night pillows the bathroom was a good surprise being as spacious as the bedroom itself with villeroy and boch fittings the bed was extremely comfortable with good quality pillows at all times the staff were most courteous and helpful and we spoke several times with a delightful romanian doorman who originally showed us to our room most conveniently positioned near to the barbican and liverpool street stations in a most interesting building because we were eating out with a previous family arrangement for a special birthday celebration we didn t experience the food on this first occasion all together this was a most comfortable and enjoyable experience highly recommended t c e from suffolk

 we travelled throughout europe by car starting in madrid and ending in paris we stayed in many hotels and our stay in paris was probably the best the staff was outstanding helpful courteous and went our of their way to help us enjoy our stay i am not one to write many reviews but i just had to take time to commend the staff at this hotel there was a lot of construction going on at the time but this did not interrupt our enjoyment of paris i highly recommend this facility 
 everything it was an amazing experience
 location metro porte d orl ans 9 mins away from there about 15 mins to city centre room clean basic equipment no fancy extras towels smelled nicely not that typical washed out hotel smell comfortable bed ironing board had stains we had no noise from adjacent rooms but not sure they were occupied breakfast no tomatoes no cucumbers no bell peppers which is unusual if not a letdown pears apples kiwis available next to muesli bar croissants and baguettes okay but below expectation for france children eat free with adults still pricey we used this only at the last day before we left staff i wouldn t overrate this but people seemed to do what needs to be done but not try to really think of their job service wise things get done when you remind the staff but like i said don t overrate this it s still okay and this is not a grand hotel finally it s a clean hotel with its own car park located in a safe neighborhood and within reasonable distance to both metro station and city we d book this again have seen worse for more money

 i have been in the hotel several times and always stayed in reasonable rooms but this time the first room your staff offered was too small and then they gave us a horable room old dusty the curtains was from 16 th century the tv was not working the image of your hotel was destroyed and i persuaded my colleagues and my client to stay in this hotel at least 4 times your reception personal was very unwelcoming and not helpful after so many times we have been in your hotel the money and value was not balanced this time the personnel in the restaurant is also not very kind best regards

 hidden on the old heart of milano an ancient factory of perfumes turned in a top 5 star hotel i like to remember a place not for what i saw or touched but for the way i felt and in this place i really felt good the suites were spacious and i can say that the 5 stars don t end at the half the hotel but you cans see it all around details and new way of seying hospitality we could choose from different pillow a michelin starred room service and a seat in the shower just to mention few and off course all sort of essence around the hotel

 it was in a great central location the hotel food was pricey but you walk out onto the street and you re within 5 10 minute walk of plenty of cafes and restaurants if you don t fancy taking the metro then all the popular landmarks are within walking distance 
 the location of the hotel is convenient the double single bed was comfortable i didn t interact with the staff members much but they seemed friendly

 everything was good
 we were travelling with my sister who has had 2 strokes and walked with a cane but were offered no help in getting to our room the room was extremely hot and we and adjusted the controls but it did not cool off and the second day someone came up from the front desk and couldn t control it but gave us a fan pretty poor for what we were charged we went for dinner on our second nite and sat there for 20 mins and no one came to our table so we left and went to the lounge where we served our drinks so i eventually went to the bar and ordered our dinner the fellow was working alone and we were terribly disappointed in our meal i had lobster bisque which was left over dishwater with 4 small bits of lobster good way to loose weight i was very unimpressed they didn t charge us for the trip to the airport but think about it this was a trip that we were looking forward to but this ruined it 
 room service was good a little expensive but most stuff was 24hrs so not bad

 i was able to fully enjoy walking through central london city i was fortunate to park in front of the hotel christmas gifts were delightful 
 we found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in london in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked 7 months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds upgrading to a club room provided us with a lounge area on the 5th floor which was very nice as the rooms are small the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean the location is excellent the hotel is within a 5 minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores the staff was very friendly and helpful 
 fantastic hotel as soon as you walk in the door you feel welcome the staff is friendly and really helpful interior is exquisite and every corner and detail is obviously well thought out breakfast was delicious and high quality as well as dinner the bed is almost too comfortable location is perfect i can definitely say this hotel manages to be home away from home

 the location is perfect for walking to canary wharf 
 the room we were allocated to was on 14th floor with a great view across the city landscape and popular features although the booking included the hyde park view and city to get the gardens view it would have to be on the other side of the building room was clean and well presented as travelled with my colleague room had two separate beds comfortably separated clean and well accessible bathroom with no hygienic issues i would agree with other comment that although it is next to the tube station it limits only to the central line the hotel staff was very helpful and check in check out went relatively smoothly we also were able to recover left in the item via mail with no additional costs the breakfast offers a very nice selection of morning food to fuel your day until evening and for those liking more variety a separate section of indian food is served as part of custom we cannot comment on dining and other meals all together i would book my stay again in lancaster london hotel 
 well located to the main attractions in central london and the flexibility to reach the hotel by public transport at different hours of the day were important to me my room was really clean and the staff were more than helpful throughout my stay would definitely recommend norfolk towers paddington to anyone staying for a short break in london it would certainly be my first option during my next visit

 the location is wonderful 
 modern and clean and the location was really good 
 can t beat the location airport bus directly across the street ditto train station easy access to not only metro lines but also to several bus lines so you can see the city did not have hotel s breakfast as it s too expensive and who wants to eat that much at breakfast lots of cafes near by including in the station where we had cafe creme and croissants

 location service and value for money were all outstanding

 far from the town centre but just opposite the street there is the railway station the tram who goes directly to the area of museums
 hotels location
 great welcome from staff extremely helpful when needed easy check in out excellent location with close access to tube station and close to the tower tower bridge and other well known attractions the area was free of hustle and bustle on the weekend all cafes and most shops were closed probably because they cater for office workers during the week as this is the financial district 
 the hotel is a relatively new one with modern stylish looks good location for public transport but not in an upmarket neighbourhood extremely welcoming reception departure was a bit detached though comfort room single use of queen bed room very pleasant and clean with adequate amenities although no in room coffee or tea making facilities an unusual open bathroom setting with a glass shower cabin i suspect only acceptible by partners or very good friends but i rather liked it private toilet though the shower is excellent good wifi too the second building is connected to the first one and much quieter by the lack of traffic noise there is an in house connection as if they were just one building so no crossing of an open court with smoking men as a few older reviews mentioned excellent breakfast i tried the restaurant once it served decent quality food in fact everything is good or excellent except for a few unfortunate sleeping issues 
 the front desk staff are very welcoming considering we stayed at other big name hotel in london during the trip they are genuinely interested in making our check in and check out effortlessly fast the location could not be any better 
 the room was extremely comfortable
 clean facilities helpful pleasant staff 
 early check in always facilitated and the staff remember i like the rooms with the garden view

 great place for stay quite good connection with the city center i loved the sauna and gym in the hotel 
 bedroom very nice with good view
 the staff is very kind and helpful with shuttle available for the clients from the hotel to the station

 comfortable and very convenient for ziggo dome also good for getting into town with the metro line 
 good location friendly staff 
 the room was great lots of space and a luxury bathroom lovely bathrobes and slippers each
 the stay and staff were amazing they were so helpful when asking on how to get to places and monuments as well as when we had asked to possibly change the room for one with a bath they changed us straight away and when my girlfriend and i had realised the plug sockets where different from the uk ones the receptionist let us borrow one of theirs the hotel was super fancy too and i know it s nothing important but the free hot chocolate was the best hot chocolate i have ever tasted i loved my stay and would go back tomorrow 
 just the location nothing more
 outstanding service from professional and friendly staff

 really excellent place to stay for access to public transport to and from vienna city centre let me explain we did some research at home before we went on this vacation this resulted in us choosing to park our car at a p r location close to a public transport terminus for the duration of our stay in vienna i e ottakring p r from there it s very easy to travel to the hotel of our choice i e fleming s hotel wien westbahnhof and the city centre by u bahn line u3 turned out to be an excellent choice the public transport system in vienna is really excellent underground trams busses we bought a vienna city card valid for 24 48 or 72 hours and this gives you access to all public transport in the city for a modest fee it also gives you nice reductions on entry fees for a large number of tourist attractions and major sights in city look it up on the web we certainly recommend it as a great way to have a good time in the city of music or the city of dreams oh i nearly forgot fleming s is a very comfortable hotel good value for money too breakfast is tops

 i don t normally write reviews but i had to take time to compliment the service i received at this hotel my friend and i came to amsterdam for a weekend to attend a concert out of all the accommodations i ve stayed at in amsterdam citezenm by far has been the best first of all the decor and layout of the hotel is superb using space very efficiently and keeping a very modern vibe going on across the whole hotel secondly the room is just so amazing the cylinder tube shower and toilet were so cute the bed was huge and comfortable and there was enough space for a safe coat hangers and a storage for the suitcases strong wifi accross the hotel was a bonus too which my friend desperately needed at times the mood lightings were my favourite part and being able to control the lights blinds tv and heating all from the tips of my fingers accross the provided ipad was just bliss the staff were all so polite each one of them always had a smile and acknowledged us whilst they walked past keeping contact to a minimal to prevent annoyance but with just the right amount of attention when we needed it even the cleaners were happy and you can t say that for many hotels i enjoyed my stay here and i would highly recommend to all my friends which i have started to do so already thank you citezenm

 staff and comfort
 marylebone is our favourite location lovely area and great links from baker st tube so this was perfect we stayed in a studio one minute from the main building our room was very compact but had an inventive layout 
 rating does not do it justice because of the concept there is little staff and facilities the rooms itself are fantastic though 
 it is quiet and neat the staff are helpful and warm the breakfast there is also good on the last night we stayed the room smells the lady at the reception immediately offered another room for us and kept the original one so that we do not need to move the luggage overall i will choose this hotel next time i visit paris 
 breakfast was appalling hotel is not a 4 but a 3 star deluxe service at breakfast was terrible they put a lady at the door that greeted you like a police officer but could not even get the staff to bring a simple bottle of water when asked food was the worst eaten chef must read this sausage and bacon were swimming in fat egg looked like it had been mixed with porridge and mustard earl grey tea had finished and to ruin everything the hot water kettle poured cold water a disaster 
 nice place
 this hotel is a luxury home from home the rooms are homely and comfortable the lounge is welcoming with hot chocolate and biscuits available after a long day out 
 staff were excellent and went the extra mile from champagne for my wife s birthday to the biscuits and water and knapkins left in the car when returned to us on our departure the room well rooms really bedroom bathroom and dressing room could not have been better from the nail varnish dryer to the his and her s sinks and fully automatic toilet

 nicely situated large room friendly staff 
 a decent hotel for a short stay the rooms had good flooring plenty of space and full length windows the location is pretty good in terms of proximity to the main sites but this also meant that it s on a somewhat generic street you have to walk somewhere else to experience the city i didn t have the breakfast there were plenty of interesting options around the city staying here is absolutely fine for a short stay but we shouldn t pretend it s anything beyond a solid experience and for that i think it s slightly over priced 
 fantastic breakfast helpful staff lovely interior would recommend 
 food and room facilities

 the location
 wonderful breakfasts with innovative menu and serving style the heated wet room in the suite was fantastic to relax and unwind with a bottle of wine after a long day sightseeing
 the hotel was ideal for kensington area good to have coffee shop attached bar was comfortable with a wide choice of food and drink rooms could do with a freshen up disappointed with way some guests appeared to be treated waiting in a queue for check in and out many guests walked straight up to the desk and were catered for should have been advised to join the queue was very rude to then be interrupted whilst at the desk by a guest whose issue could and should have been resolved after i had been dealt with something that staff need to be instructed on 
 very courteous staff great location

 it s a fantastic very modern hotel with friendly and helpful staff our room was spacious with a comfortable bed breakfast was excellent and the spa swimming pool superb 
 i liked everything however the staff were outstanding and deserve a special mention they could not have made me feel more at home particularly the two girls at reception and the young lady who worked in the bar area i only wish i knew their names but i am sure their manager must be aware of how wonderful they are the room was by far the best i have stayed in in amsterdam and i have visited many times the beds were huge and extremely comfortable and i am already planning a return visit could not rate the place highly enough thanks to all there 
 the room was very spacious modern and stylish although the glass wall between bedroom and shower may no appeal to everyone

 the staff very friendly and easy to approach we booked two rooms and travelled with small baby and the lady at the reception was so kind to allocate us and my parents on the same floor she saw us coming with the baby stroller and accommodate us in a bigger corner room with more space i would definitely recommend that hotel if you are visiting paris with a small baby the hotel rooms are really quiet and no noise from the street or neighbouring rooms there is also a lift very tiny but that s paris so you should be happy to have one at all lovely quiet street overlooking the park nice design very clean probably 5 min walk from the nearest metro station but we used it once as we walked pretty much everywhere very comfortable bed location is good if you not looking for a very busy part of paris but close to bastille or nation if i would be visiting paris again i would book that hotel for sure again wifi really good my parents had much smaller room but with a sofa their toilet was much smaller and the only comment from my dad was that if there would be bigger person than it would be quiet difficult for them to turn around in that toilet or get into shower but hey it s paris and we liked the place and we fitted in the toilet lol

 location
 staff were very helpful when we asked to change rooms which we did because of the noise from the after party going on downstairs hotel site neglected to mention that there is a live talk show hosted every week night from about 10pm which means metal detectors and security guards in the lobby and consequent noise fun if you want that sort of thing but unexpected however our new room on the fifth floor was delightful quiet view over the rooms of amsterdam and comfortable beds great central location for walking about the city and catching trams plus street entertainment and watchmen sculpture also clouds of marijuana smoke from people chilling out in the rembrandtsplein which might put some people off 
 attentive and polite staff at reception and restaurant clean could not really fault it will be rebooking on our next visit to london thanks

 the king size room was clean and tidy and the en suite was a nice size however we didn t like the shower and set up of the bathroom because there was a drain in the middle of the bathroom and when in the shower due to the size and where the shower was the water went everywhere and everywhere was left wet once you had showered needs a short screen or curtain to stop this from happening the bed wasn t the most comfortable and the walls are thin to the point i could hear the man upstairs conversation when he woke me up at 4am the staff were lovely and friendly and did all they could to make the stay enjoyable 
 room was really clean and staff very kind and friendly

 a great location for the traveller arriving at euston the thistle euston is less than two minutes easy stroll from the melton street exit go out the side next to the police post to avoid the front exit steps if you have luggage and an excellent base for central london with buses running past the back of the hotel 5 minutes north to camden and 5 minutes south to bloomsbury and the underground northern line at euston rooms are an adequate size for a london hotel clean and well equipped but look rather tired and well used the extra cost full english buffet breakfast buffet is good value and offers a good selection of cooked and cold items very busy and the staff are clearly working at full stretch all the time leave your table for more than two minutes and your seat will have gone 
 the staff are so friendly and helpful this is my second visit i love this quirky hotel

 our room was comfortable and trendy
 the room exceeded my expectations and was a lot bigger than i expected upon arrival the lady at reception i wish i remembered her name instantly greeted us and told us everywhere to go and where not to go in amsterdam she spent the best part of 20 minutes making us feel welcome and willingly giving us her advice we had booked at spa zuiver you have to go for the next day and she rang them up asking directions to get to the hotel and made it so easy for us make sure you use the airport shuttle free of charge on your way to the hotel as it makes your trip so much easier the hotel itself was beautiful and so was the standard room although it was definitely more than standard i took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the staff were so lovely and decorated the room for him as i requested i m not one to stay in the same hotel twice as i like to experience different hotels but i am 100 booking this again next time we are in amsterdam the skybar was incredible and makes the hotel even better than it is and gives you a real feel of luxury at an affordable price i honestly had the best time at this hotel the only negative thing that happened was on our first night we were told we could go up to the skybar with our drinks and when we got up to the top the bar man was clearly not in a good mood and was rushing us to leave when it was only 11 15pm and shut at midnight however everything else was perfect so he s lucky his colleagues made everything else so nice for us otherwise i would be giving a completely different review all in all stunning hotel lovely sized rooms and bathroom friendly staff apart from one good location tram stop is situated 100m from building and takes 15mins to get into central station skybar is a bonus and hotel airport shuttle taking all the stress away from getting to and from the hotel thank you ramada see you again

 hotel was very easy to find on arrival staff were very helpful it s obvious that this hotel had recently undergone some major renovation the bar is not yet finished but that did not detract from our enjoyment of the hotel breakfast was continental and a good variety of offerings toast cheese cold meats salami fresh fruit croissants and other pastries various cereals and also a gluten free option for 4 95 extra one could have a full english breakfast which although i did not have this option looked very good the bed has to be the largest bed i have ever seen it s huge and very comfy bus stops are just a few metres from the hotel and are easy to understand for 1 50 the number 23 bus will take you into london city centre great eating places to be found near the hotel and very cheap once checked out we were able to leave our bags and collect them later on in the day prior to going for our train home i cannot praise this hotel enough although some may consider it a bit far from the tourist attractions i say give it a go you won t be disappointed it s only a 10 minute bus ride away from oxford circus
 the staff were friendly and very helpful the metro was extremely close and made getting around barcelona very easy our room was on the 5th floor and had its own patio to sit out on the room was very quiet and had curtains that blocked the light makin sure we got a good night s sleep after all our exploring

 very good location close to the center very good breakfast 
 all was great for the price however i do not think it would be worth a higher price 
 their system lets you choose the room you like very limited choice though one room per floor a couple of days in advance so you can check in before you actually arrive my selected room was ready and the notification came before 6am so when i arrived at the hotel around 10 30am i could pick up the key and enter the room right away which was great check out is also done online so no waiting in the queue i think this works well for a hotel with so many rooms 
 very good breakfast room very comfortable staff cheerful and welcoming

 i paid 88 00 for the night which in london is cheap tea and coffee facilities in the room and a fridge which was handy if you re staying more than one night then probably not for you as the rooms are small we stayed for one night as we were seeing a show and having the saturday and sunday day time sight seeing so the room was fit for purpose in that respect just somewhere to lay your head 
 wonderfully comfortable beds linen fabulous showers good water pressure 
 very courteous and conscientious staff very comfortable beds nice bathrooms good breakfast buffet
 a lot of nice little things are being offered automatically printing out board card directly from the room real good coffee machine cappuccino etc in the lobby free of charge in addition to the standard nescafe in the room free drinking water fill up in the lobby and on every floor they even provide you an empty bottle if you don t have one very good wlan quality in the room now this are all not very expensive things but makes your stay in london very comfortable also supermarket two nice pubs the lamb the crosse keys and the sky garden very close by will definitely check availibilty next time

 the location cannot be beat the staff was extremely accommodating and polite but if you ask a question to the wrong person they are immediately going to tell you that they don t answer that particular question and you should ask the next person i made the mistake of asking the concierge for a question that the check in person was to answer only to be reminded by him that he was the concierge it was not his responsibility to answer the question and to ask another person at the desk all i asked was whether i should dial o before the number in paris in addition depending on who you have seating you in the restaurant they are either adamant that they will serve you breakfast or that you should get up yourself as it is a self serve all in all the location is amazing as you can walk everywhere the cleanliness can t be beat and i would certainly book there again

 i ve been saying at this hotel 4 times now my main reason for choosing it is the convenient location and the clean comfortable rooms it s a new hotel and that makes a difference i recently discovered the half board offering and i am very pleased i read a few negative comments regarding the food which i don t understand maybe because i m vegetarian there are plenty of choices of warm dishes salads and vegetables fruits and cheeses for the price of this hotel you would normally not get half board for a business traveler it is great for someone looking for a romantic dinner with table service don t expect that here but explore the cities options i also like the breakfast and the option of soy milk yogurt

 we stayed for a 2 night stay for my partners birthday it was the best customer service we ve ever received at a hotel not to forget the most beautiful hotel we ve stayed at also i m confused as to why it s a 4 star not 5 that star needs to be added on that s for sure we also can t thank anna enough for all her acknowledgement effort she made us feel so welcomed as well as all the other brilliant staff we got an upgraded room birthday card chocolates we were also shocked in a good way when we found out we were put in the vip lounge in the bar which made our night even more special for us there s so much to see do in this hotel we barely even went out of the hotel we decided we preferred staying in we relaxed by the most beautiful pool there s also a modern unique lounge on the 1st floor that you can play games have coffee in and you can also head up to the restaurant bar terrace which is amazingly laid out with beautiful views this hotel will have your whole stay planned out it s the only hotel we ve stayed at that actually has a lot to do see inside we re so excited to come back in a few months for our anniversary as we know it will be the best hotel to stay at for such an special occasion it s also the most perfect location close to tube station very close to food places also a shopping mall what more could you possibly want apart from wanting to live in this hotel

 location
 the ace shoreditch is the best i love the vibe and the young culture there is so much to do in shoreditch and the metro is easy to access the staff is great the beds are comfy and all the little knick knacks are so addicting the restaurant is insanely delicious the bar is always madly busy 
 nothing to like booked for three nights as i was visiting friends room was basic but that s all i needed as i was only sleeping there and planned on spending most of my time sightseeing bed was comfortable nothing special bathroom very basic but not the cleanest with mould on the bath tub but a quick shower was sufficient unfortunately the only problem was the fact that unknown to me a deposit of a large amount of money had been taken from account even though i had been reassured that my card had only been swiped for room service if i chose to use it this only came to my attention when shopping and my card declined which was hugely embarrassing as i knew i had sufficient funds to cover payment having contacted the bank i was told that the money had been taken by ramada returned to the hotel to enquire why this had happened only to be confronted by a very rude receptionist who said it was standard procedure and that i must have authorised it when i argued this and asked to see the manager who was called naveed i was horrified at his attitude as it was worse than hers the fact that he couldn t speak english and had problems understanding basic english made matters worse to the point another guest who had overheard even tried explaining but even he was shocked that he was the manager yet couldn t speak basic english i asked to see the notice regarding the card being swiped and it stated 50 which is fair enough so why was my card swiped for a much larger amount they didn t know but all he could say was that the money would be refunded into my account in the next few days so i was stuck in london with whatever cash i had in pocket and ended up relying on my friends to cover the meals out etc the only good thing that came out of my stay was the lovely staff in the morning who were preparing breakfast great little team who couldn t do enough and always greeted you with a smile and the breakfast was delicious 
 location to camp nou only

 we enjoyed the hole experience from when we entered the hotel to when we left staff great clean and very tidy and location was great we did not eat there for breakfast or dinner as there are some great bar s cafes just outside where you can sit outside and people watch the one thing about this hotel was one reason for booking it is that it has a roof terrace with plunge pool and bar which turned out to be a disaster as most of our stay it was closed to general guest s as the management had let it out to company hospitality booking s gave us the impression that the normal guest mean s nothing to h10

 overall very pleasant experience however apart from ricardo who was very helpful and approachable the rest of the reception staff could come across a little bit short very mean glasses of champagne as well whenever i have ordered one they only pored half lol the sky bar wasn t finished but the website did not mention that prior so i was quite disappointed that every time i wanted a drink i had to go down to reception where receptionists said that they are not bartenders although they stand behind the bar lol

 i stayed entire month at the hotel every single day was perfect home atmosphere great location great stuff good breakfest i loved absolutely everything 
 ter marsche burger bar downstairs really handy location but roadworks outside made getting in and out of hotel very tricky 
 i stayed here for 7 nights and breakfast was provided with the price of the room the location i very convenient close to several metro lines and also a 10 15 minute walk from major attractions like the seine notre dame pantheon sainte chapelle etc the area felt very safe and there are tons of restaurants and cafes nearby it is also a short distance from shopping areas staff was very friendly and helpful the room we had was facing the street and we got a great view of a nearby chapel and the water fountain and in the evenings musicians would be playing at the cafe downstairs we were also surprised that the room was a bit bigger than what was in the pictures online breakfast was included for us which was great because the food was definitely solid and there was a wide variety to choose from i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be in the center of paris close to tourist attractions 
 staff were friendly
 the rooms are spacious
 everything was good enough the room was big the breakfast was good 
 received a warm welcome and a brilliant upgrade breakfast was wonderful we would return
 we booked a panoramic view superiour double and first got a room in the centre of the 8th floor aparently the panoramic view starts at 8 which is too low to call panoramic in my opinion they moved us to the 16nd upper floor corner room 1602 which was bigger with twice as much windows and an amazing view over amsterdam very friendly and helpfull staff a plus is that the amsterdam metro stops in front of the building every 8 minutes and it just takes 15 min to get to the dam

 this hotel punches well above its weight it s like they took my list of things that really annoy me about hotels and made sure none of them were present i was incredibly impressed with this hotel firstly it s not silly money for the location that got me there in the first place and it exceeded my expectations in every respect check in is excellent lots of staff all of whom were friendly efficient this is repeated throughout the hotel it s properly crewed and service is excellent in every department early check in was handled charmingly and luggage stored properly unusual for many hotels our room was superb small but very high quality they managed to fit in a proper sized desk decent armchair nespresso machine and all the usual gubbins decent sized bed with great pillows decent linen the aircon actually cooled the room too the hotel is in an ugly purpose built concrete block and the huge advantage of this was the rooms are very quiet interior d cor is great all comfy and great ambience bathroom was a decent size and most unusually for hotels these days had enough shelving for all your stuff and a mirror that was actually lit enough to use breakfast is impressive firstly you get your tea and coffee within seconds of sitting down it s always a pleasant shock when that happens it s well staffed the food is kept stocked and the quality is high they ve got all the usual stuff and the quality of the cooked breakfast was great this place was a treat really enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back 
 i have to say i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the citizenm i had never stayed there before and they kind of blew me away with their kind of co working space and cafe with hotel rooms concept it was seriously comfortable the staff were lovely and the rooms while small and some sort of capsule version of living in a space station lol were very well appointed seriously comfortable and could have everything you could ask for i really really liked it problems in my room were dealt with promptly and efficiently and i thought the staff were top notch my general impression of london hotels is of getting ripped off and paying through the nose for a not so great stay citizenm kinda changed my mind about staying in london definitely my new go to hotel when forced to stay in ol blighty location next to the tate and some of the great dining of bankside also quite appreciated nb i had a deep discount on the room so thought it was quit the value for money not sure how i d feel about their standard rack rate

 impossible not to like this hotel great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in we also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices the staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail we were initially booked into room 1024 which faces onto the westminster plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them to be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms we decided on a junior suite room 1027 which looked out on big ben county hall and the eye it did cost 20 more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive

 mainstream 5 star hotel perfectly situated in the very heart of vienna a few minutes walk from the hofburg palace the graben shopping street and st stephen s cathedral it is in an old good looking building but at some point in the past 15 or so years was the subject of an aesthetically questionable refurbishment it is however truly impeccably clean and maintained to an as new level that is not easy to come by in lesser hotels the deluxe room was of fair size also impeccably cleaned and maintained and fairly well equipped for a business class hotel we paid a little extra for a corner room with more windows and i felt like it was also a little bigger than other rooms on our floor it was one of the very few to have a balcony which was a nice touch no space to sit but pleasangt to walk out in the morning the minibar was adequate water coke and beer and free throughout the stay nespresso is provided but oddly not a kettle we did not try the breakfast but did use the spa gym sauna steam bath and relaxation area which is nice and very clean if often a little crowded

 the hotel is easy to locate for a first time london traveller and strategically situated in the moderately quiet location of west london without being too far away from the main shopping district of oxford the proximity to holborn underground was a saving grace because it is a logical alternative should the heathrow express fail you such as on christmas eve for example finally the concierge staff are incredibly and consistently helpful when you need support and directions
