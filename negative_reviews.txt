 there was nothing to dislike
 water went away one morning too expensive for what is offered
 the staff were overly attentive in the reception area and yet in the restaurant at breakfast there never seemed to be enough staff and the ones who were there seemed overworked very stressed they seemed to be doing their best in difficult circumstances
 there was pubic hair in the bathroom the kettle to make tea was broken initially the key card to the room did not work the staff did not assist i have taken photos of this 
 window was stuck open so it was cold all night tv didn t work if i got in shower my head wend through the roof room wasn t ready when i was told it would chips with my dinner was cold was only one plug so i couldn t charge all my stuff up couldn t connect to the wifi and the milks in my room were off and wasn t anything to do in walking distance
 internet speed could be faster some rooms really suffer with slower wifi speeds at least in the past staff is sometimes not flexible about changing my room because of slow speed when hotel is booked full i ve been here 4 times these are my only negatives no ac but usually not a problem 
 1 room was extremely small and situated on 1 level therefore almost no direct light 2 electric smell refresher was plugged and it was too much there was not fresh air in the room when we arrived and it took us some time to get normal smell in the room 3 sound isolation is very bad i woke up in the morning because of people talking not shouting in the next rooms and i could some hoovering on the floor above 
 paying for the car parking was a total shock and just added to a very expensive single night stay very poor shower very tired looking room very expensive not very friendly staff i will never stay here again in fact i will seriously question stay in any holiday inn hotel
 taxi drivers did not know it was open so dropped us of at wrong plaza hotel resulting in a walk not happy
 nothing to complain about
 everything
 the wifi service is abysmal it continually drops your connection extremely inconvenient
 nothing to mention
 small bedroom for what is paid 
 the room was very small
 during the check in i requested late check out and the customer service lady said she can give us an extra hour but unfortunately during the check out i obliged to pay extra 20 pounds for the late check out 
 no problem for me but maybe a problem for elderly guests as there is no elevator and the steps are very narrow
 i booked a single room and got a hallway corner next to the elevator for 130 eur a night it was stuffy no air no ventilation very loud and i would not stay there again 
 nothing
 front of hotel was very dirty
 bathroom was smaller than expected but okay 
 at first the room was not up to the standerd i m used to at the same hotel
 poor staff communication at times i had booked a babysitter for 7pm and was told she would come ten minutes early i checked twice with the hotel to be sure she was booked and would come on time she actually arrived 30 minutes later than expected and had been told by the hotel she was required for 8pm and had been asked to prepare for a 3yr old and 7yr old my children are 8yrs and 12yrs this was the hotels fault and not the babysitter as the wrong information had been given to her this was unacceptable to us as my husband and i were looking forward to a rare night out the hotel did not compensate us for their error either the cleaners were inconsistent at times especially when filling up the coffee pods tea and sugars and did not always remove dirty cups we even returned from an evening out to find they had failed to service our rooms which were still as they had been that morning and so i had to call them out at 10pm to clean massage was good but too short and very expensive i paid for 30 minutes and got 20 minutes as i was started seven minutes late and finished a couple of minutes early very expensive at 45 euros very sweet waitress in the restaurant the one inspired by ciel bleu but poor service we waited 30 minutes for our menus and a drink and there were long delays between courses they also removed our wine so we had to wait for them to come back to refill our glasses which sat empty frequently in the end we asked for a wine bucket and subsequently they made money as we drank the wine then ordered another bottle my husbands steak was overcooked and they removed his plate but left me with mine so i had to eat alone and when i had finished his food arrived and he had to eat alone which was very poor half of the cold meat starter tasted like lighter fluid while half was fine the waitress laughed and didn t understand when we mentioned it the cheese plate was poor the shop was closed
 two mornings running housekeeping knocked on bedroom door to clean room at 8 15am and tried to come on on one occasion appalling service at the skylounge bar restaurant we were totally ignored when trying to get a table and left when we complained to guest relations we were simply told the restaurant wasn t run by the hotel do they not understand if affects a guest impression of the hotel 
 television reception
 nothing
 location is a bit away from the happening parts of amsterdam but the tram stop being right outside mostly makes up for this 
 poor location
 although a nice and lovely place it is rather expensive for what it is 
 the hotel elevator was so small i could barely fit myself and my one piece of luggage a carry on roller bag however this is to be expected in an older building just be aware if you have more than one piece of luggage and ask the staff to help you 
 the room water dropping from the roof it damaged the thermostat so the air conditioner stopped working called front desk and said will have it fixed and we will be moved to a diff room but did not happened following morning entire carpet were soaked with water
 all was good perhaps breakfast too expensive but plenty of good cafes near by
 should have complimentary water in room
 the air condition was blowing directly towards our pillows on the bed 
 front desk staff
 for us nothing everything brilliant and obviously customer focussed 
 breakfast way over priced so ate in local cafe
 no balcony
 very unsafe location
 niente
 breakfast poor quality glorified canteen unfortunately 
 no tea and coffee facilities
 not being able to get in on the night of our arrival
 tiny room like a cupboard thin walls could hear what was going on in every room around me not great at night and as a normally very good sleeper i got very little sleep slow slow elevator
 the room is a bit dated the fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked 
 should be special considerations for guests in the bars e g priority seating
 beds uncomfy and sheets kept coming undone underneath no duvet just sheets etc
 we didn t like food in the hotel both in restaurant and bar actually there was no bar just some limited service in the lobby you can expect more in barcelona rooms are rather dark 
 very few staff members spoke english as their first language which made expressing our needs very difficult the night manager was argumentative rude and unhelpful 
 hotel was under refurbishment and waiting staff was very slow and un organised took 20 minutes to get strawberry jam for the afternoon tea for 4 people 
 rooms very dated like going back to the 1970s paid 340 a night for a single room very inflated because of the expo 
 the mini bar was not stocked disliked the check in system and won t use it again under staffed at reception poor service
 nothing not to like
 room service personnel very unfriendly 
 breakfast wasn t great
 i travelled with my brother so having the glass shower didn t really work for us but it s perfect for couples 
 we did not opt to pay for the breakfast as it was too pricey 
 bedroom was tucked away and away from everything else apart from that all good
 rooms are too small
 we had no warning about the refurbishment workmen working 9am to 6pm very very noisy only 1 children s channel tuned in on the tv 
 would prefer a walk in shower
 nothing
 the service in the breakfast was not good
 the wifi did not work in the room apparently we would have had to pay for it if it did which was unpleasant the shower didn t work properly we had to burn ourselves as the cold water was not working the swimming pool is not free there is a fee which was super uncool as we have been misled into thinking it would be free 
 shower was not draining the water fast so thought it would overflow
 nothing that can put me off from visiting again 
 wifi is not wotking in side the rooms
 i missed a human welcome my check in check out was self service which i don t mind but it would be nice if the staff at least greeted you when you entered 
 the rooftop bar was closed
 nothing i can think of
 food very average
 the elevator was broken and no other choices services were not good
 unfortunately for us there were road works directly outside our window for the whole night we stayed so we didn t sleep when said to man on reception at 4a m he gave me ear plugs they didn t block out the drills or whatever were making the noise outside 
 seemed rundown and dingy 
 there was only one type of scotch at the bar according to the menu and they seems to be out 
 half eaten apple was left in ice dispenser on 4th floor for days 
 no proper bar
 there is absolutely nothing to dislike
 staff manners
 would like a kettle in the room and a better view
 breakfast wasnt good enough for the money they charge extra room cleaning really bad and pillow and bed uncomfortable never again
 the pool closes at 7 30pm i don t understand this most people would not be able to reach the hotel by that time whether from work or sightseeing seems like a waist the locker rooms and pool facilites are in desperate need of refurbishment another thing i was in a business meeting the last day and had to check out a few hours later than usual well the hotel staff kept calling the room non stop where my adolescent kids were waiting for me to come back i am sorry i call this harrassment meanwhile there are literally hundreds of rooms in this hotel at the end they did not hesitate to charge me the late check out fee despite the fact that they made those 2 extra hours absolutely unbearable for my children the general manager of this hotel has not heard the last of me finally i booked partly because there is an executive lounge where you could get breakfast afternoon tea and snacks well the staff in the lounge is really unhelpful you have to get your own everything there is very little food all in all it s a good idea that is poorly executed 
 the shower temperature went in and out of cold and hot 
 rooms not ready no flowers no water
 there wasn t any protection for our personal things a computer was stolen inside our room there wasn t any security procedure for what was missing terrible experience 
 would have been nice to have a coffee machine in the room
 nothing
 maybe 4 star would be more realistic it s nice but nothing outstanding
 nothing 
 the bathroom was small the room was a little colder than we would wish and the room service was a bit slow 
 the room was a little dated and the windows were filthy the bells are very loud but you expect it as its so near st pauls and expect street noise 
 nothing 
 would be good to be able to open a window
 room needs a good refreshment
 room window was too small
 we where offered to up grade but in our room was no bottles of water and the 2nd day there we only had one bath towel 
 took ages to work out how to run the bath 
 staff on arrival was arrogant and unfriendly hotel was not situated very well rooms wasn t cleaned properly 
 cost of breakfast was high so we had breakfast elsewhere cost for two around 20 
 nothing
 booked a suite but it was on ground floor with literally no view so was dark and unappealing to be fair they managed to find us a standard room higher up with balcony etc which was lovely breakfast was only until 1030 so we missed it both days bar is nice but not particularly lively being picky id say the wardrobe space was minimal and there was no bluetooth speaker in room 
 noyce in the morning from outdoor is a little bit annoying just across the street is a building site 
 no coffee or tea making facilities
 small rooms not goot breakfast
 door to toilet you can lie in bed and hear everything no door to beautiful en suite the door should have been full length in my opinion 
 no gym
 if i had to find a fault and i am really scraping the barrel here i would say that the view out of our window wasn t the best we were facing out onto the back of some other rooms but as we didn t spend that much time in the room it wasn t really a problem for us 
 air conditioning in room not operating sweltered overnight and very poor sleep
 the only criticism was the bed was a little too firm for my liking otherwise everything was lovely 
 just that noise and view of course 
 none
 the hotel booked a dinner on river boats but neglected to tell us there is a dress code we were turned away and not allowed to go on board it ruined our trip and evening 
 nothing
 arrived quite late as we were out with investors checked in at 7am requested for a late checkout which the hotel gave till 2pm which was great checkout did take around 20 minutes which imho is just way too long was awaken by a construction site right next to the hotel at around 8am which we weren t even told about that went on for a good few hours i was then woken by room service at 11 30am even though i requested a late checkout and had pushed the button to not be disturbed had to go to the door and explain i was then woken up again at 12 30pm by room service and had to explain the price you pay to stay here you d expect way better service no apology at checkout either it s a real shame as the hotel really is great 
 the rooms facing the main road can be noisy as the tram passes in front of the hotel also its quite far from the centre but both tram takes you there easily 
 i would have liked a safe in the room as in most continental hotels
 sleepless night before we got another room very noisy one can hear guests on the floor above when they snore take shower walk etc i wanted to leave the hotel after 1st night tiny room twin after we put bags into the room we couldnt walk in the room anymore basic breakfast breakfast room looked like in a hostel not a 4 stars hotel low quality food door to kitchen were open all the times when i asked to close as i was seating next to the kitchen they disagreeed so i spent breakfast in aromas of washing liquid and noise of dishes being washed staff not really helpful when asked to complete towels missing in our bathroom they ignored it unsecure space to leave thebaggage and you have to carry it yourself as a whole compensation for a sleepless night we got chocolate two stars would be my most rating i dont recomend this hotel conparing to other 4 star boutique hotels i gave been to this is really much below the expected quality
 breakfast was not included little surprise in the morning 
 the room was frozen i had to warm the bath with the hair dryer there s a gym room but without electricity nothing work
 you have to pay for the internet in your room 
 the breakfast wasn t good the pastry wasn t fresh and it wasn t edible if you don t like under seasoned english breakfast then you have to eat some bread and cheese with gummy cucumbers 
 terrible light for applying makeup
 the reception and whole feel of the place is clinical and rushed the reception staff surly abrupt and took a deposit in additon to the nightly rate which i was not informed of when booking the price also was not value for money my first time in a holiday inn not for me 
 totally out dated not in a charming way last update looked like it was 40 years ago bedding was like sand paper
 was a little expensive
 external stairs to car park were slippery when wet could be dangerous would appreciate better provision and knowledge of dietary requirements gluten free 
 actually i was nicely surprised and nothing to complain about
 rooms could ve been a touch bigger considering paid for an upgraded room also given a different room to that selected at online checkin
 this is the second time i have been offered a room for the disabled on the first occasion we arrived early enough to change the room this time i arrived fairly late on my own and had to get up at 5 30 so did not want the hassle of changing rooms if my wife had been with me we would have not accepted the room as fit for purpose a number of features are too low for the able bodied and there was a smell coming from the drains after a shower this decreased and was fairly clear by morning could management please review this strategy as there is a very acceptable alternative nearby room 361
 more bathroom privacy with a real door 
 amazing 
 strong odour in room chemical not properly attended to during entire stay given a spray bottle of lightly perfumed water thats all that was done even after several days of telephoning 
 pretty designless corridors but that s nothing 
 bathroom a bit too dark dinner was ok but there is not enought places to sit and the self service part was crouded 
 wifi wasn t good rooms were not taking care of in the morning staff not really professional that s a shame 
 restauration succinte
 coffee tea making facilities in the room would have been nice but staff were great about delivering it to the room and it was much tastier coffee than instant 
 prices were ridiculous a ginger ale and a cheeseburger cost 80 euro 
 fitness center was not enough for my taste but this is not a minus only for my opinion things which would be nice to have are some more devices like bench etc but like i said this is not a minus 
 i think reception try to encourage you to use services they get commission from rather than what is best suited to you i asked to book a taxi to sitges and they quoted 137 50 but i got licenced taxi outside hotel for 70 on the meter 
 the fact that our rate was non cancellable clearly with the adele concert cancelled we would have liked to exercise this option 
 there is nothing to dislike 
 staff
 breakfast too expensive needs a comfy bar or lounge with some atmosphere 
 room a bit gloomy in the basement would have liked brighter lighting 
 very tired inside
 it really lacks plants and greenery outside there is only raw concrete without ornamentation a fresco would be welcome at minima the noise from the outside could be reduced considerably with double glazing bedding is not advisable if you already have problems with back pain 
 small bed
 towels so old torn and no complimentary water 
 shouldn t complain because we had 2 showers and 1 bath but one of showers did not work staff were very loud in the mornings moving things around outside our room and talking very loudly 
 its loacated on zone 4 way too far away from central took loads of time to move back and forward since we stayed here for 4 nights wish it was closer 
 no coffee making in room
 breakfast average rooms really small 
 ground coffee and a biscuit would have made it better 
 nothing
 very small rooms
 pool is very small 
 old room poorly cleaned
 location and breakfast 
 n a
 no water to drink except minibar 
 nothing it was excellent 
 little things in room weren t attended to eg ordinary tea used was not replaced book of hotel details wasn t in the room control to open curtains didn t work 
 room very stuffy with no access to fresh air bed had very firm mattress which affected my back 
 requested a room with a view but although room was very nice it was a basement room so no windows which was a bit disappointing 
 the staff who processed our check in seemed a little lost without being able to locate our reservation 
 they treat their costumers very rude
 the mattress was very old squeaking all night we informed housekeeping but nothing was done 
 we had issues with housekeeping several times rooms were clean however the housekeeping service was not what we would have expected 
 the staff were not accommodating at all i let them know a month in advance that i will be traveling for 15 hours by flight before arriving and needed an early check in apart from the check in service was poor the room did not have the basics we had to ask for days for a face cloth before someone got it for an international destination and hotel their english was not even basic the hot water water ran out often no international news channel on tv large room terrible view of a work in progress construction building right next door to hotel the concierge was ineffective there is a large shopping center nearby with restaurants and shops this hotel is close to the metro and hop on hop off bus 5min walk traveling to seville after barcelona and the service was worlds apart to this hotel staff were friendly spoke excellent english took the time to explain the sites and routes and make recommendations checked me in at 10am etc 
 everyone good 
 the artwork on the wall it s not to everyone s taste also breakfast was ridiculously expensive so we didn t have it a little far from the centre of milan so not always easy to get back late after a night out or to leave early for a flight 
 really love and appreciate the breakfast bag but that yoghurt was disgusting didn t smell nor taste ok 
 the location would have been better if it was closer to the town centre however still an excellent hotel 
 over looked by another room through the window
 i booked a club room which should be bigger than a regular room and even that was small and makes you suffacate and even that it was small the air conditioning was terrible in the room that they gave me at first the hotel said this is the best it can get staff were helpful to show me other rooms but all the same all the rooms were hot a c barely functional no air flow and not cold enough couldnt sleep for 2 nights hotel has a serios a c problem that they should fix i definitely dont recommend this hotel specially in summer 
 it was rather expensive 
 breakfast for extra cost location however close to metro is in construction zone 
 being mugged in the barcelona olymipic park so a strange women walked up to my partner and asked us to fill in a petition to get disabled access to go up the stairs before i knew it a man came out of no where and asked me to do the same then as we were walking away the pair came with their piece of paper and started banging it saying a donation x as i went to get the loose change out of my wallet the man started banging even hard on the paper and what was very clever the woman must have taken all of my cash because when i got back to my hotel my wallet was empty so be careful do not get caught out another review point that i worried about was the fact that there was a shooting range right next door if you have a room around the back and side i imagine that it would have been loud but if you pay to stay at the front it has hardly noticeable 
 very poor sound proofing i asked for a non smoker room and i got the other one and all the smoke from the other guests was coming in my room i had to wait 3 hours for my room to be ready the bathroom was full of mould on the ceiling 
 the elevator didn t work many days guests should use the starirs or the service elevator it was really dirty
 rooms were a bit outdated but still fine for our needs 
 rooms with windows to front main street can be a bit noisy
 staff at reception has too many duties upon arrival i waited to check in as the people were handling bookinks the early check in fee i will not go back there it is highway robbery 
 bathroom door should not be transparent 
 the room had a weird odor to it the kind of smell from an air conditioner that has accumulated mildew or mold it was noticeable only when we walked into the room after being outside for a while the shower door was a bit impractical i noticed the new design in europe is to install a glass shower door that only shields half the length of the bathtub if the shower head is in a different position it is very easy for water to spray out and all over the floor we had water puddles every day which was annoying since we had three people in my group 
 we didn t like the cost of the breakfast hence the reason we didn t stay to have it
 everything was perfect
 nothing
 nothing weather to cold
 nothing
 booking com screen on the net stated free continental breakfast with executive room but the hotel said it was room only 
 bed for a single person couldn t walk round to access and had to climb over partner bathroom not private and small basin in room meant floor got wet trying far too hard to be cool and funky with app based room controls that didn t function properly 
 the only negative was the bath it was kinda weird to adjust the temperature from cold to hot and it too a little bit time and also the bath telephone is solid and you have to figure out how to rinse the soap 
 nothing
 the breakfast is the same every day 
 my double room was ridiculously small i had read the rooms were small so had thankfully paid extra for a double on arrival there was no cupboard space not even to hang a coat or dress only a small space for a few shirts nowhere to put luggage so was tripping over bags in the tiny space impossible to imagine two people having to share this room the bathroom was also very snug and smelt of cat pee the shower doesn t drain properly and therefore floods the towels were small rough and not good quality no excuse for this and easy to remedy bed was hard and tv reception came and went am really surprised that booking com had given this hotel 4plus stars would really not recommend not good value for money 
 bath robe 
 n a
 nothing to be a problem 
 internet not provided to booking com clients room run down and tired poor value for money
 breakfast options should be enhanced a bit distant from the city center 5 min walkiing to the nearest tram station plus 10 15 minutes to reach the city center toilet brush missing a bit weird 
 matraces are very unconfortable pity 
 choice of food
 small room
 the neighbourhood is not the most tourist friendly
 very poor wifi
 the staff are polite and welcoming its a pity the hotel didn t live up to the standards portrayed the room was cold the bathroom cramped the wall paper was badly marked there were no plug sockets near the mirror which meant i had to find another way to make sure my hair was ok i would have been better off in a b b or travel lodge
 room was very small and cramped all else was good 
 didn t like the bathroom there is a sliding door which is heavy and awkward to move and blocks out no sound i won t go in to details i would have liked some drinking water in the room 
 nothing really 
 the bed was not good
 in general it was not a good experience can not get parking for the car easily the closest parking was 4 minutes walk smelly in the toilet the room was on the underground floor and inconvenient by passersby and cars
 went to the officers mess at about 9 30pm for a liqueur before retiring but there was no baileys or drambuie available and quite frankly the staff did not know what liqueurs they had so we retired without any 
 price is a bit overestimated 
 cold water in the swimming pool because end of the warm season not the hotel issues i think it would cost too much to warm it all the time hah
 nothi g
 unfortunately the bar staff later in the evening were more interested in playing the tv as loudly as possible for their own benefit than making sure we could enjoy a nice peaceful nightcap i think the manager had gone home for the night 
 far from old city museums etc small room and slippery and not comfortable shower breakfast not included in price
 twin room small
 fitness room basically non existing very disappointed they put this even on the website 
 nothing
 the brekfast
 breakfast is really poor for a 4 stars hotel there are no choices only basics it is similar to a 2 star hotel breakfast 
 waiters on the breakfast were a little bit unfriendly may be because was monday hard day 
 i had stayed in other park plazas and the rooms in this one are smaller than in other properties
 the pool was closed for repairs 
 the room was a little small for 3 people and the pool was tiny
 the wellness area could be better steam sauna was not looking really that attractive wifi coverage was good but could be a bit faster 
 nothing at all 
 i didnt book breakfast as at 20 a little expensive for me as i probably would have just had cereal and toast however had a very nice coffee in the room so not a major problem
 coffee in bedrooms only expresso
 n a
 staff is useful honestly we drove on our road trip around europe from paris and got there really tired gps sent us to the location displayed on the site but the hotel is not actually there so we called and after explained the lady with the very poor english on the phone that we couldn t find the property then she asked how can i help you so obviously she wasn t paying attention or didn t understood a single word it was everything prepaid but in the counter i were told they block 50 euro per night 2 night stay from my credit card for the mini bar that content specifically 2 bottle of water 4 assorted soda cans 1 beer and a bottle of orange juice so i have a quite expensive minibar 
 more tea bags in room dodgy light in bathroom breakfasts expensive
 hotel is very old it is not as in the pictures 
 not enough room in the bar to sit down
 no bathrobe and no sleepers shoes and when i asked for one they charged me 5 pound the distance between the hotel and the underground station is approximately 10 minutes walk 
 a c in the room wasn t working the maintenance person entered the room when the privacy sign was on the door knob and left the room door open main elevator only goes down from all floors except the main floor 
 very dated colour scheme in room
 price of drinks 2 drinks vodka and lemonade and a disorano and coke 50ml 28 30 i was shocked we payed on top of that service charge we was sitting at the bar this shouldn t be added on the bill people should be able to decide to tip or not decided to go to a bar round the corner where it was only 12 50 for doubles 50ml also being woken up by people shouting down the corridor at 7am slamming front doors and slamming the interconnected door to our room my 1st wanted lay in in a long time and couldn t have it 
 the rooms had awful lighting and the bed and pillows were uncomfortable the whole hotel was too dark tv in the room did not work 
 expensive sangria and beer at the bar
 shower water pressure
 price of milk shakes 
 nothing
 concierge was very unhelpful 
 the bar area wasn t very enticing small and with uncleared tables and loud piped music so we didn t stop for a drink there and our room was so cold we asked for another blanket which was given to us but overall we loved it 
 we are a same sex couple at check in the receptionist asked us if we were ok with a double which i had booked in the first place and i said yes that s what i requested he then asked if we would prefer a twin room it made the situation really embarrassing for me as i then had to say no it was like he was dilberately fishing for information all the other staff in the hotel were very nice
 if i can be precise and to the poiint no loo brushes to clean the toilet which was a little embarrassing also the location is not on coventry road as thought plus the postcode is a little confusing better location pointers
 the room was advertised with a bath and we actually received a room with a shower that was too small to turn around in i struggled to wash my hair in there and felt extremely chlostraphoebic you also couldn t open the windows you can also hear every noise throughout the hotel so we didn t get a very good sleep my partner is just over 6ft and was hanging out of the bed all night 
 lighting in room
 top floor rooms can have low water pressure rooms facing the main road are noisy at rush hour 
 tv didn t work booked and paid for double room got a family room in worst location ever lights didn t work got woken up at 3 am with fire alarm false alarm complained and was told we would get a call didn t get one 
 the stuff is very professional and friendly
 they had a incense in the lobby and bar that i was sensitive to so i could not spend as much time as i would have liked to their
 restaurant staff let down the hotel layout of breakfast buffet makes no sense and breakfast staff totally uncoordinated and with no attention to visiting guests had to ask 3 times for basic cups of coffee which eventually arrived at the end of the breakfast 
 hotel restaurant was not good 
 not one thing to fault
 there is nothing to unlike 
 room was a bit sparse given the cost
 tiny room and awfully view on the wall from opposite building very dodgy neighborhood 
 nothing we disliked this hotel exceeded our expectations in every way 
 metal from the matras was poking out and the pillows were very uncomfertable 
 the hotel is a bit old but still good
 no negatives 
 value for money ac didn t work in my room called but was never repaired city tax is upsetting and expensive premium wifi is also expensive 
 pillow and mattress is not 5 star even is new 
 nothing that we remember our whole stay was perfect 
 uncomfortable pillows
 umbrellas if raining 
 although the hotel claimed there was free wifi the wifi did not work i was relying very heavily on the wifi for my work and was extreme disappointed and frustrated that it wasn t working properly the staff was very accommodating and came up t the room to try to help but it didn t make a difference 
 rooms could look better furniture such as chair and sofa looked shabby didn t like the curtains furnitures looked liked they were nt cleaned properly less drinks in mini bar breakfast too expensive and was not included in our superior room upgrade would not rate this room hotel luxury 
 breakfast quality of hot foods was lacking stale pancakes and waffles soggy scrambled eggs really good if continental style options are what you like but eggs were so sad and hot breakfast needs make over 
 taxi in front f hotel ask double prices
 breakfast is poor no internet at the room
 the restaurant service is bad concierge is next to none the cleaning staff even came for window cleansing when i was in the room 
 bigger room
 on booking i paid for breakfast but it did not say it was just for a continental breakfast so like many other visitors who thought the same as ourselves we walked to the breakfast room and told to go back up a tight hallway past the gym and find a room where we were to have our meal the breakfast was pure misery of pickings of fruit with no taste yoghurt thick with watery whey on the surface coffee was bleak and croissants that needed butter but none to be found 
 single bed tiny towels lack of toiletries in bathroom poor curtain arrangement let in lots of light 
 nothing
 hotel was a bit noisy at night
 breakfast 
 if i am being picky the quilts were a bit heavy carpet could do with replacing 
 the first room we had was for three people the room was so small there was no space for putting our things or moving around getting ready was also a challenge we requested a larger room and was given one the next day this room was larger and better for 3 people 
 the wi fi signal was rather poor in our room in evenings 
 service terible
 it is not a 5 star hotel i have booked on a discounted rate but still it doesn t worth it the staff were pretty rude and i believe specially since i booked through booking and asked them if i will get points on my hhonors account they have treated me as a second class guest the bathroom needs a renovation even in executive floor the carpets are messy in the city that you have public fast free wifi in the middle of the city in museum quartier s huge open space it is a shame to charge for a pretty hard to get wifi i am sure that i wont stay in this hotel again unless it is heavily discounted again for the same price you have many other more interesting options in town unless the proximity to the train station to airport is a must for you 
 they could have refilled the coffee in our room on our stay there should be a safety handle bar next to the bath avoiding a slip when getting out reception was too efficient and there was no empathy with the guest so a warm welcome fell short
 our room had stairs and the shower was inset into the bath which was quite high for stepping in and out of 
 food drink in bistro expensive
 room a little small but well laid out
 heat in room no aircon
 the staff did seem at times like they were being put out by simple requests such as can we have an extra coffee set up then we wouldn t have one when our room was made up next it was ridiculous 
 i didn t like the fact i couldn t do a late check out
 bar food menu was not very varied too many burger type meals breakfast was baked under hot lights without and attention
 first day wifi didn t worked on any apple devices there is an option to use mobile app as a key but personnel don t know how to use it you have to update your booking virtual email with the real one and activate app
 had to wait a long time to check in but staff very helpful and attentive had to cross a passage to the wing of the hotel where my room was and felt a bit unsafe even during the day 
 small rooms very tired decor thin walls 
 none
 no smoking room no balcony 
 pricey breakfast
 room was exceptionally small making it difficult to even open your suitcase 
 slight mix up with room service wrong room number was recorded against my order therefore i had to chase my order for them to realise which room i was located in 
 everything was nice except that the noise from outside could be heard and unfortunately while we were there some constructions started in front of the hotel and we were barely able to sleep more than 7 8am 
 coffee was weak and not hot toast cold and not toasted enough
 a guide on places to eat nearby would have been helpful 
 elevator was not working however my stay was only for one night and they said it was going to be repaired the next day 
 everything was good
 sauna wooden bench broken ladies 
 just the coffee at breakfast time why do so many hotels still let themselves down when there are so many good coffees available
 breakfast items were not well stocked up so had to ask for a couple of items and there were no glasses for a little while to have fruit juice in staff were a bit slow clearing plates bowls etc also had to ask for tea coffee also i personally don t agree with the automatic 12 5 service charge added to every bill 
 no complaints
 small room with tiny desk
 the wi fi does not always work 
 nothing 
 wifi not free 
 pay for wifi
 our air conditioner was broken and the room was very hot the staff seemed somewhat indifferent they did offer a fan and suggested we open the window sadly the street noise was unbearable so we closed the window and sweated it out for two nights as the hotel was booked full the third night they did move us to a cooled room which was wonderful we were grateful for that in the second room everything was clean and well kept all the glassware in the first room had obviously been used by prior guests as there were lip marks and fingers prints on them we had expected the second night we would have received clean glasses but we got the same ones over again for a hotel which could be top notch with such little effort this was disappointing i wish i could give top marks and really want to say i loved this place but it fell short they are so close to having a really great hotel so i hope they will address some of these issues 
 breakfast can be better
 my booking was messed up on arrival and i spent ages try to fix it would say the room quality does not live up to lobby quality
 room was cramped 
 got lost quite a bit poorly signposted even the staff didn t know where some things were
 people in charge for the swimming pool did not treat the guests equally 
 when booking it would have been nice to know e could bring our own wine 
 no last moment change of dates possible
 we were on the 5 floor someone was smoking and it smelled of smoke pretty strong i thought it was a non smoking hotel
 the service of room was made only at morning 5 star hotel usually do it twice
 a bit too formal 
 a little more variety at breakfast would have been nice 
 we would have like to eat in the restaurant for an evening meal but the hotel did not provide that facility however there were loads of restaurants close by 
 noisy fridge in the room
 breakfast is a little bit simple 
 every things
 not able to have massage as no vacancies 
 booking com would not refund us one night when we had to cancel
 no refrigerator
 there is a button on the phones that say room service which obviously you press whenever you want room service however someone at the hotel rang us on the room phone at 4 30am waking me and my 84yr old grandma up just to check if we wanted room service very rude and inconsiderate she doesn t sleep very well anyway and this pointless unprofessional disturbance we felt ruined the whole stay 
 wifi a bit difficult to access good support however from the staff to get internet access organised in meeting room 
 i booked this for my wife who was traveling on her own first time in london i went for a better quality hotel thinking that the service and hotel would be very accommodating ohh i was so wrong i set the booking as a late check in and as my wife got there at 11pm due to traveling long distance when my wife at the hotel very tired and wanting to sleep and rest the hotel reception would not allow her to check in as she did not have my credit card when i booked through booking com i said that i would not be traveling and i was booking it on her behalf i asked to speak with the reception team as my wife is a foreign to try to explain the situation reception declined and was trying to chuck my wife out of the hotel and treat her like a tramp of the street i rang the booking desk and a man said there was noting i could do unless i paid again so with my wife now crying i had to transfer money to her account so she could get a room so now i have paid twice something i was not happy about reception said to my wife i could call the manager tomorrow that s very helpful after 30 minutes of waiting on hold to speak to booking com apparently the only person who could sort this mess was them i spoke to a nice man that rang the hotel and then they said the had refunded me and could take 48 hrs still no money and they had upgraded her if the room was a upgrade i would of loved to see the first room a ground basement floor room not only this but when i booked i asked that i did not want ground floor as i wanted upper floor for better safety for a single women on her own i have worked in hotels for over twenty years and single woman are always put on upper floors this is one of the worst experience i have ever had to deal with my wife some distance away and me at home looking after my young children worrying if my wife will be on the streets of london all night 
 tiny little room more space is needed really
 drinks in the bar were very expensive though i suppose this is to be expected for the location
 food choice and quality underwhelming not what you d expect given the hotel s star rating room full of leds that won t switch off and numerous missed opportunities to attend to those small details that make all the difference 
 breakfast quite expensive and wasn t as nice as i had thought paying to use the pool was a bit annoying as it was expensive too 
 the room had not been refurbished for 15 years if not more the extra set of windows mounted to insulate the room caused a constant sound of wind pulling due to the draft from the window vs the door 
 wildly overpriced i felt like alan partridge at a cliched conference venue imagine paying those outrageous prices for a room and having to pay an additional 16 per day for wi if wow hi it s 2015 you re a conference hotel get with the programme and no water in the room the small cold uncomfortable depressing room i took longer to check in than i ve ever experienced how can that be the queue wasn t that long and everyone was getting a bit annoyed not a great start your modus operandi is completely geared towards extracting the maximum out of your guests such balance sheet rather than customer centric ways of working are as outdated as your decor 
 nothing
 two beds when we asked for a single doble 
 although the breakfast was adequate we were asked to move to the bar area when we were having our final coffee we were not asked if we had finished our breakfast 
 restaurant service
 none clean and staff great 
 noisy at night as trucks unload bunch of things right under my window
 air conditioning poorly maintained we had to call the front desk to have the unit serviced so it would work properly
 none i loved it 
 the mattress was as hard as the floor and so i didn t sleep at all and got up with terrible pain dye to the mattress 
 it s not too easy getting cases and baseball gear etc to the top of the second floor with windy staircases but we managed it for anyone who is perhaps not as fit or is incapacitated in anyway you may want to ask for a lower floor 
 service charge expected to pay even though poor service for bar meals
 couldn t open windows so didn t sleep well either night
 there was nothing bad at all
 a bit too much noise as we were under they sky lounge bar 
 ausencia de room service
 breakfast in paris hotels is not the best this is no exception 
 very loud could hear other residents passing through the corridor at night and in the morning room had a wooden floor which probably contributed to the noise levels and also made the room feel a little colder the walls were in need of some paint both in the room and on the corridor of my floor scuff marks were present in the room both on the skirting boards and on the walls hotel also took a thirty pound deposit which i wasn t aware of i didn t see it mentioned on the booking com website 
 the shower had a decent water pressure but at times was difficult to finely regulate water temperature the room was a bit stuffy when the windows were closed even with the ventilation air system on but it was not overwhelming the vending machine was out of coca cola 0 5l for 2 and almost every other drink and the staff offered to sell me cans of coca cola from their refrigerator in the back 330ml for 3 60 which made zero sense to me 
 facilities certainly doesn t meet the five star criterion staff friendly but extremely inefficient 
 nothing it was a pleasure from start to finish 
 a little walk to tube in the rain
 no thing
 leaving 
 lack of food choices at the bar
 rooms were very small not a pleasant view from the back we had originally booked executive rooms but were put into the main hotel room so we weren t sure if we were supposed to have a bigger room 
 for a hotel in this price range there was definitely not enough attention to detail like 1 we only got one small shampoo shower gel per day even though we were two in the room 2 one of the cupboard doors hinges was broken loose and door did not properly close has been like that for quite a while apparently 3 the door stop was taken apart on the second day its parts were lying on the floor until we left
 only problem the noise of the tram when in bed asked for a quiet room but if chamged room would cost an extra euro 500 for two nights not worth it a cup of tea after 6pm doubles in price euro 5 could do with english news on tv in room 
 disappointed the room toilet had no wash hand basin so that meant having to go round to the bathroom as the two we separate 
 the room we stayed in was on the side of the hotel and therefore a side street it was quite noisy at times from local businesses emptying their rubbish in to the bins 
 the poor choice of free television channels electricity switches not at hand
 room not ready when we arrived at 10pm 
 the lift was a bit slow but it is a small hotel so there is no need for multiple lifts 
 booking mixed up so had to wait 20 mins and in first room they gave us someone was living and someone got into our room at 4 am not even say sorry never knew who 
 size of room cost of room no tea making facilities leaking bathroom ceiling
 although the transport links are excellent it s a few miles from the centre and there s little near the hotel apart from a business park or two breakfast is a little pricey 25 for 2 people and the continentals can t quite do a full english bottled water wasn t replaced daily either these are minor quibbles though the hotel is excellent 
 the neighborhood was awful and the train stations are not close 
 bathroom was chilly and no bottom to shower screen so water flooded floor had to use our towels to mop it up room was on the small side my husband had to climb over me to get in and out of bed as bed wedged against window 
 housekeeping friendly but no english
 very less options for vegetarian person in the breakfast
 the hotel charged as for internet which wasn t nice in 5 hotel 
 a kettle in the room would have been nice 
 stayed in a ground floor room and woken early 6 30 by staff out the back on both mornings windows single glazed so heard everything 
 the king bed was actually 2 singles pushed together and didn t feel level wifi too weak to use in the room cooked breakfast items bread and coffee not good no coffee facilities in the room reception will bring it to you though room decor was a bit tired 
 bed was not clean staff not friendly or helpful 
 lacking in milk for hot drinks in the room on the first night did supply more when asked very expensive for a night for info no view breakfast was extra 
 paper cups in a superior room no iron in the room uncomfortable bed and charged 10 to purchase a adapted plug i have stayed in many hotels and none have ever charged just lent these to me very disappointed
 the breakfast room was busy on one of the mornings and the food the plates and the cutlery ran out 
 the rooms are a bit small as are the bathrooms 
 check in was annoying and delayed as 1 hour the check our was realy early and no exceptions though the hotel checked us in late one hour
 our rooms were in the next building u have to walk outside with the luggages for the executive rooms located in the next building
 cleaning and replenishing of room was not to a high standard phone in the room did not work there was a general lack of attention to detail 
 none
 nothing
 the room was too small if staying longer you would need a bigger room
 place could do with tidying up paint job there was plaster peeling off in places very expensive for what you get breakfast is great but service was lacking at times had to ask for coffee 3 times before service and that wasn t on the busy day had a conference on on one of the days but we hadn t been warned ended up queuing for breakfast not what we expected if they had said been warned we would have come down earlier or atleast wouldn t be mentioning it here car parked 1 50 an hour we parked up at a tube station for our duration and paid 5 a day unlikely to use again 
 rooms too too tiny claustrophobic getting in out a major pain one had to go through 5 6 doors to get in or out beds also v small definitely no value for money
 the staff and the wifi 
 waiting staff in restaurant far too slow not enough bar staff on duty at night 
 we had a problem with towel refill for some reason some towels were always missing for city center you need a 10 taxi but the i wouldn t change the site city center was too busy and hot to stay 
 long walk from the city center
 food and inexperienced waitress
 nothing
 slow wi fi connection
 the location is a bit industrial don t expect to walk anywhere much at the price i paid i m struggling to find anything else a couple of fixtures needed maintenance but everything worked fine 
 the staff is not good at all 
 small cramped rooms and bathrooms so typical of uk hotels
 although the rooms are ok the windows are old no double glass and the noise from the street is so big that next to the bed the hotel provides ear pieces like those people use on planes crazy 
 would expect breakfast to be included in the price of the room 
 room 203 dirty filthy windows with some double glazed panels missing from the frames cracked floor tiles in bathroom dirty basin old creased badly fitted carpet and dirty greasy finger marks above the bed bulbs out tv not working not what i would expect for 4 star
 not really worth the price for that standard got terrible dark room with the wall and electricity cables out of the window depressing very dark changed after requested the next day with extra charge but for normal room with the view and the balcony 
 1 sound proof was t good 2 there s no conditioner in the bathroom 3 the clean lady knocked my door at 10am not the check out time twice for no reason i was at a good dream but hardly to fell asleep again after that i told the reception but he just say apologize and explained the clean lady was new 3 in the beginning i noted i need a room with bathtub but they gave me a room without that they did fix it in the end but i would say they should be able to pay more attention on customer s request 
 shower gel bottle was empty when we arrived and wasn t refilled during our whole stay choice for breakfast could have been better wifi wasn t very fast 
 it was a little bit hard to find and no place to park my car but i think it s ok for the city center
 the breakfast was pricy so we didn t have it
 had to ask for dishes and glasses for breakfast several times staff bit slow taking orders for breakfast
 the air conditioning wasn t working very well so the room was a bit stuffy 
 i have no comments to make as everything worked well for me and i enjoyed my stay 
 i booked for 2 sets of connecting room i receive one set of connecting room staff at reception was not friendly disappointed 
 laundry being delivered in morning and thrown into basement right beside my window bathroom fan on all night being charged 2 75 for small bottle of mineral water 
 air conditioning system need to get improved
 nothing
 add 20 euro for a young kid there are two sex shops on the street room has a bad smell the elevator and aisle are really narrow and the wall was painted in pink makes the whole place like a love hotel there is no lobby at all have no idea why this is rated as a four stars hotel to be honest any 3 stars airport hotel is far better than the place 
 the room was very hot and the aircon was not working
 everything was lovely can t say a bad word
 nothing not to like
 room size and toilet size is very small the bed sheet was not clean all in all it is not a clean hotel 
 nothing 
 breakfast was too expensive need some eat and run options as our tours left early each morning or even a sack lunch we could purchase 
 the air conditioning was not working making it very uncomfortable to sleep 
 the rugs in the bedroom could do with a clean or a change everything else was fine 
 only downside is our room didn t have a refrigerator rates are high but we got a good deal 
 expensive 
 not a single problem
 
 a little far out but then again it was very quiet and in a good area
 waited an hour for our meal at marco pierre white restaurant we were given a complimentary drink each but steak was not good waitress was faultless apologizing continuously whilst waiting for our meal 
 parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors 
 nothing to say
 executive lounge was poor
 this is important main doors in hotel when you in after you need to lock the door if you don t door will be open so my points night time people came late and drunk they might forget open the door just more safety for everyone door when close has to lock it self
 spa and fitness centre could have benefitted with a hot tub
 a c not effective room too hot all furniture except bed was uncomfortableunsatisfactory poor lighting no worktop 
 room was not clean although bed linens were good but carpets and walls in the pathroom were stained furniture little bit outdated but still acceptable 
 nothing
 nothing 
 rooms door were a bit heavy and slammed shut but it wasn t anything that ruined the stay 
 rooms were very small
 the rooms are a bit small
 it was a bit noisy around in corridors and upstairs
 water heating system was not good 
 not applicable
 i had no complaints at all 
 there was not a thing we did not like
 nothing
 price
 our room s ac did not work so a fan was already in the room which unfortunately was still too hot our only minor complaint 
 the room was disappointing for the price lights weren t working in the bathroom so we showered in the dark rang reception to ask for them to be changed and i was on hold for over 15 mins before the call was answered said they would be changed but this didn t happen the jacuzzi bath didn t work and there was no shower curtain so the bathroom would be soaked in 4 mins luckily house keeping were good and came up and mopped the floor after every shower nb just ask reception on your way out don t bother phoning all the facilities gym etc were closed over the weekend we stayed and there was no advance warning very disappointing 
 the fridge was closed and we asked them to open it to put our water they said you can only buy things from the fridge the room was a bit small as well as the tv which had no signal in some channels or the picture was not clear because it was aerial not digital there were no enough lights the bathroom was a bit of an old style generally the room does not reflect the lobby which was far more beautiful 
 did not serve alcohol
 not an amazing choice off places to eat but depends what u want and on the junctions off very busy road couldn t hear traffic in room though
 breakfast not great for 18
 the facilities are a bet old and the gym is small for the size of the hotel 
 expecting more of a wow factor
 the receptionist when we checked in was unhelpful when we asked about getting into city centre breakfast was very expensive we only bought breakfast one morning 
 nothing 
 only one elevator but that s not very important
 rooms were compact but did not distract from stay
 very small interior window
 door in the bathroom very uncomfortable
 the restaurant too much salt in all the food they prepare 
 gym pool area were ok but not fantastic 
 nothing
 hotel very quiet so the staff slightly over attentive eg was asked four times by four different staff if we were enjoying our breakfast not a big issue just a bit much while eating 
 lack of restaurants within walking distance but bus services were excellent and easy to use 
 nothing had a great stay 
 the toilet are very smelly very strong urine smell when sitting on the toilet the bed were so old and cheap it make lot of squeeky noise there is kitchen but not washing gear to wash any dishes tv were so old it were more like a 2 star hotel 
 if only sullpy coffee making in the room
 extremely unprofessional staff absolutely not at the standards of a 5 star hotel technician made inappropriate jokes about hot water problems room wasn t done at 3 00pm after having been away all morning 
 we booked 3 nights but stayed only one there was bad smell in the corider we got a room wich was dirty hairs in the bathroom the floor was dirty we changed room but it didnt help so we checked out the next morning and moved to another hotel they charged us for 1 night more then it was on booking plus city tax
 room smaller than it looks in the photo
 thought breakfast was overpriced but don t let that put you off 
 the duves were a bit warm to the season while the pilows to big to my taste 
 little bit hard madrass in the bed 
 hot tub wasn t hot and our coffee machine didn t work
 not as clean as it should be for a 4 i got very little if any sleep the walls are very thin and every time someone went past my room i thought they were actually inside people constantly closing and opening doors and the noise was an absolute nightmare would not recommend especially for the price and given that it is supposed to be 4 disappointed 
 soundproofing is zero i felt as if i slept in the lobby 
 i like to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room
 for food sensitive guests they can put food labels about type of meat and other ingredients etc in free snack and breakfast bar 
 single glazed draughty windows so could hear traffic noise 
 lack of restaurants and pubs around tv in the room and the multimedia system are outdated and require an upgrade 
 single room very small but adequate for one night and reflects the reasonable price 
 i got charged for 5 rooms when booked 4 not impressed as took many phone calls to get my refund and no apologies j
 nil
 very noisy
 rooms are getting a it dated
 nothing everything perfetto
 the bed was not at all comfortable i could feel almost every spring under me as i moved it was certainly not what i have experienced in other hilton hotels 
 could not fault a single thing
 the bar staff in the evening were awful didn t know what they were doing didn t know whether or not they were serving food and took far too long to make drinks and serve you i had also informed the hotel that it was my partners 21st birthday and it would be nice if they could make the room just that extra bit special but no such extras were made which is a shame cause i would have been happy to pay for a bottle of champagne or something in the room on arrival there was a long queue to check in and out we were also woken up by a cleaner in the morning continuously knocking on the door and then when we answered she simply said it was the wrong room staff at breakfast were not very helpful either although the food was nice and there was a great selection there was no coffee and no one to ask for help 
 breakfast was very expensive 30 per person so we chose to eat at the cute french patisseries instead 
 shower was small and i am a small person but nicely updated really quite minor 
 i can not really say anything bad about the hotel if i had to nit pick i would say the toaster took long at breakfast 
 nothing
 internet wasn t working which was quite a problem for us as we depend on it so much but it wasn t the fault of the hotel breakfast items ran out before we got there at around 9 00 am extra fee for using the safe prefer to make it a deposit for return of key suggest that reception has a decent map of where the hotel is in relation to key sites and tourist bus services 
 having to leave 
 the breakfast buffet could be better things like butter soy milk fresh whole fruit and healthy mueslis were missing 
 perhaps the lobby could have free coffee or hot chocolate
 no free breakfast included
 adjacent empty buildings looking like post war lebanon
 receptionist was as nice enough to upgrade us to a bigger room that we were very thankful for he ruined it in the end when we asked for a late check out to accommodate for the train schedule pet very bad attitude for a simple question and he proceeded to talk about us in french with the concierge as though we didn t understand really don t need the attitude for 200 for one night 
 nothing i didn t like
 noting
 our room was a bit run down stains and mold on the bathroom ceiling with that said it was a good room over all
 it was a bit far from the nearest metro station which is am schopfwerk 
 we had a large room but they were unable to supply an extra bed 
 the room located underground no fresh air because no open window 
 that the balcony door wouldn t open 
 extremenly bad and uncorfortable bed no matter what
 infact very old wndows at the front not shutting down properly the sink in the bathroom was leaking 
 ok the room was very small 
 room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends
 smallish bathroom but comfortable shower tiny lift and narrow stairs breakfast time too short i would prefer till 10am 
 not a lot of wardrobe room for clothes 
 two things i would like to emphasize 1 during our stay the a c in our room didn t work and it was getting really suffocating and hot the complaint was registered and it was taken care in 24 hrs hats off to mr fischer the floor manager and 2 the location of the hotel is in a business centre and hence you don t get to see any hotels or restaurants nearby which is a negative point but good for business people work at vu medical centre and closer to schipol airport 
 we were sent a form prior to arrival about requirements etc for the room it also asked if it was a special occasion which it was our wedding nothing was done for that or even mentioned by the staff seems rather pointless in asking if one is not going to do something special also the bar has a great atmosphere filled with memorabilia however a bit of attention needs to paid to the cleaning of the objects there was a lot of dust on some of the pictures 
 bathroom looking very shabby not in a chic way no top of soap and no conditioner for hair bed on coasters so when sat on it it moved 
 there was nothing 
 i was very unhappy happy with the shower and bathroom facilities as we had a privilege room and payed the extra money for that the shower was very disappointing and the the toilet flushed was broken and we had constant trickling from the toilet
 terrible breakfast terrible suite vs price
 basement feel to room executive double didn t live up to expectations a bit dingy small bathroom fittings old didn t work well room wasn t very clean very disappointed 
 no mushrooms at breakfast sofa bed the mattress was very uncomfortable 
 the breakfast options are limited and it starts at 7am starting at 6 30 would be better as sometimes i have to leave the hotel early to catch a flight 
 can t find anything negative to say about the square duomo 
 everything else we got a smoking room when we requested non smoking and i suffer from asthma respiratory condition the check out took way too long which made it a big rush to the train station and included me missing the train to london the gentlemen helping at the checkout didn t even know the difference between mastercard and visa it was all not too 5 star for my liking and got me questioning my booking at the sofitel dubai mall 
 wasn t given the room on time had to wait an extra hour also room given wasn t the one advertised to me when purchased 
 no 
 rather outdated amenities and living quarters
 while the staff was helpful it would have been even better if they took more time to explain where things were being a visitor it is not always obvious where things were located and most names were new to me otherwise everything worked very well at this hotel 
 nothing i didn t like
 very busy and sometines the service was delayed
 the shower was inconveniently built 
 the tv was too small bit strange that it was an imac would rather have a proper tv and then can use my laptop if i require a computer 
 very dark room 
 the smallest hotel room that we have ever been provided in 40 years of travel measured of room including a bath room closet and entryway was 10 6 by 11 would never stay there again because of cramped space 
 not much the bathroom tiling and plumbing could do with an update and was a bit small but pressure and temperature were excellent which is much more important 
 the food options in the lounge are great but unfortunately not everything is available 24hours also understandably high tech comes with some trade offs when the pad with which you control the functions of the room is out of battery you re out of some options until it is recharged 
 nothing 
 window didn t close well quite noisy on street side 
 the hotel itself as well as the room were disappointing for the price the facilities room size and starchy towels do not reflect the rating also what was considered a terrace is far from what you d expect some of the rooms face onto busy bar streets which can cause disturbance during the night 
 we had charge for the bevarages that we did not order 
 we booked a double standard room and we got a disabled access room after 4 days i am still waiting for the preauthorised amount that has been taken at check in
 the single bedroom wasn t basic it was a cell 
 cold room ceiling panel fell down in bathroom no mini fridge no water in room 
 the problem is that the room and the bathroom are too small which makes you feel nervous there is always a bad smell in the corridor 
 small rooms marks on walls and they didn t change the bin from the people staying there before us staff were rude i had to ask 3 times for an iron
 no complaints at all would stay there again 
 it was made unclear to me when booking the type of room i was paying for i asked for a room with a lounge area and upgraded to acheive this but still failed to have one i complained when checking out and given a 10 00 refund although the upgrade cost me 70 00 
 rooms not ready on arrival at 7pm keys issued to incorrect room that was occupied by other guests staff in general surly and inflexible short term stay of many guests leads to this rather apathetic attitude 
 nothing it was fantastic
 they could have had more availability for spa treatments
 size of room very small
 size of room only rest excilent
 the bed wasn t very comfortable very hard and i like a soft bed and the room was an odd shape with the bed all the way up next to the door 
 breakfast expensive
 the room service menu 
 breakfast seemed to work fine but there seemed to be a big rush for the evening meal regardless of the time we picked the dining area is busy and the goodies disappeared fast for example the meat and the dessert they were replenished but not quite quick enough 
 booking a single room is always tricky this was stated to be modern if by modern they mean imported from a house of ill repute that is more or less correct very odd lighting arrangements in the bathroom that i could not turn off with a peephole window to the bedroom piece de resistance was the large round bed that took up most of the floor space breakfast was included but not of a good quality 
 only had 1 night
 the extractor fans in the room was very noisy and the room was freezing 
 n a
 had issues with payment afterwards but was sorted
 booked a twin for single occupancy as it was same price as a single and got a single pokey room 
 i didn t find anything that i didn t like
 toilet and bath shouldn t be in different places 
 nothing 
 staff were rude booking was mixed up key stopped working executive room was nothing more than a normal room equipped for 1 person not two would never go there again tried to call them and the clearly only answe if you use the premium rate number 
 a kettle si mis sing in the romo algo a fridge 
 bad wi fi asked for queen bad got twin which was annoying air conditioning was easy to handle no other facilities coffee machine only worked after breakfast 
 very small room terrible smell from the bathroom the air conditioner didnt work not so clean as it should be fot me this is not a 4 star hotel 
 here is the list of issues 1 no bath as showed in description photos only shower 2 hairdryer is broken it switched off within one minute of use 3 two lamps near the bed are broken 4 the window is much smaller vs on description photos and the bed was obviously not larger then 2m as stated in description in addition an interior itself is very strange in black and red colors frustrates 
 over a family emergency we had to check out after our 1st night we were staying for 2 nights however we were not giving any refund for missing 2nd night in any other situation i d let it slip but you would imagine over a family emergency to leave so soon they would have some sympathy
 similar to ruby marie across the road no kettle or tea coffee facilities but did have a fridge 
 not enoigh heating 
 noise from other room
 i felt badly let down as i booked an executive room as part of our honeymoon at considerable expense and got a small family room with poor bathroom facilities tucked away in the olderst and un refurbished part of the hotel i had worked on business on a large conference here some years ago and had a good experience so was very disappointed
 the kitchen staff talking in the courtyard it echoes significantly and woke me up continued despite complaining to reception
 staff were not helpful very unfriendly horrible service 
 old furniture usually any hotel provides you with a lot of staff that you need like shaving kit shoes brushes tooth paste but it has only 2 hair lotion 2 body lotions and 2 soaps 
 
 room service
 arrived an hour early and was told room was ready however when we got to room it was still being cleaned had to come back downstairs and wait we were offered tea and coffee and within a short while we were told room was ready room no 9 is a delux double however there isn t anything delux about it in need of some furniture in room it was very bare plain white wall with a tv hanging on it also a lack of plugs there isn t one plug socket by a mirror to dry hair the plug sockets are near enough on the floor on one wall away from any mirrors very noisy in room above footsteps could be heard and banging doors no tea and coffee in rooms had to order it milk came with tea and it wasn t fresh it was those little plastic cartons of uht milk not nice fresh milk would of been so much better 
 can t think of anything
 i have 2 change 2 lifts to reach my room with a baby bagy
 very sparse the room and very limited choice of restaurant or eating facilities 
 size of tv
 there was construction and we were woken up every morning by the sound of hammering and banging would have liked a discount but ever got it
 very good experience location is a bit far from some attractions but taxi readily available 
 had difficulties finding parking in the neighbourhood
 not safe my colleague s room was robbed by someone with key access we attended a conference and two others were also robbed of laptops and ipad in same way the staff even suggested it was fraud on the guest s part 
 breakfast need to improve internet conection also need to improve 
 the room is tiny very comfy but tiny the door doesn t lock from the inside as in no chain and that i never like breakfast was average service was average 
 the rooms were small as many in london before arriving it was difficult to make an agreement with the reception staff about an additinal bed 
 the area is not very exciting and in the evening there are lots of homeless people 
 bar closed early limited room service
 the shower was sometimes cold in the morning possibly they had solar panels 
 everything about this stay was great nothing negative to report 
 i would like to have ability to have breakfast in my room without excessive extra charges
 no complimentary water in the hotel the neighbourhood seamed a bit dodgy in the evening 
 the room doesn t have air conditioning 
 wish i could have stayed longer
 unfortunately there was a problem with our airconditioning so we were woken up a couple of times the first night by loud noises coming from the airco the next morning we told the staff and they immediately apologised and relocated us to a different room on the same floor they even moved our bags for us so compliments to the staff despite this unfortunate event 
 nothing
 very small quibble elevator numbers not very clear to read 
 there was nothing we didn t like 
 the entrance is very obscure we would not have found it if it were not for the direction of a stranger in the alley way additional information ahead of the trip would have corrected that problem 
 none
 old furniture
 the bedroom we were offered was very small far to dark with no windows to open for air i had booked this room for my husbands birthday and was disappointed with the quality of the room we were given
 we were informed a day before check in that the room would be small and that we would need to upgrade
 location was very inconvenient forget about doing anything around the hotel 
 worst check in and check out experience ever 
 room was a bit pricey no bath tub in the urban rooms
 roadworks outside all through the night that we weren t warned of either before trip or after we arrived first night s sleep was particularly disturbed offered free parking when i raised the issue but nothing pro active from staff which i would expect i was told roadworks were unexpected and they weren t told about them in advance as is usual i find this hard to believe as they were routine resurfacing works 
 the food was not too good also i had a problem with the room being super hot and it took me a while to get someone to help me with it alex saved the day on that one 
 breakfast choice can be better staff is not friendly i requested top floor room with ciew and early checkin but did not receive any of the requests
 couldn t figure out the light switches toilet ran when flushed float needs to be adjusted wish hotel was closer to the town center but city travel was fairly easy conveniently located to trams buses metro 
 having stayed 4 or 5 times here i felt disappointed by the service in the bar staff chatting while customers waited for service food not cleared away when finished generally slower and less friendly than on any of my previous visits reception restaurant and room service staff were all excellent as usual 
 could hear noise from the neighbours banging doors speaking loudly but otherwise all was lovely 
 i had never stayed to ata hotel linea uno because they changed the location to ata contesa jolanda the last day as a result my grade is for this hotel the location was disappointing because was not near the metro as the initial booking 
 the ambiance in the restaurant was a little lacking although the staff were friendly 
 the rooms were extremely smal for two people bathroom unconfortably small the breakfast room and food availability was poorly managed empty dishes not immediately filled staff not helpful
 poor quality of shoe cleaning 
 the milk in the fridge was off and when i asked reception for another one it failed to arrive 
 rooms were a little small but that s quite typical in paris
 too long hallways long distance to the lift
 room smelled bad as did a lot of the hotel common areas the room was really small and in the basement which i apparently couldn t move my kids felt it was sort of creepy tiny bathroom and the bathroom door closet door and edge of bed are will with about 10 inches of each other must plan ahead when maneuvering around with multiple kids in the room too i mainly stayed there because i needed to stay in that specific area i will look for a different hotel next time 
 the heater didn t work in the room called reception 4 times nothing done about it the toilet was also blocked in our room called reception to be told there wa no one that could help us until tomorrow morning so had to use the toilets in the hallway 
 none
 the first room i was put in smelt strongly of smoke despite being a no smoking room i m asthmatic so i can t sleep in rooms with strong smells such as smoke the rooms were small and extremely dingy the finish on the room was poor with wallpaper peeling in the corners and fittings being quite old and worn the downstairs lobby area was also a bit shabby 
 nothing
 with busy lives and children we only get away together very very occasionally and do spend time choosing hotels where we are going to feel aesthetically comfortable as both of us work in the arts on the booking com website the deluxe double rooms looked lovely what we got we are sure was not a deluxe double room with four poster bed it did have a four poster but it seemed we were given a room in the un refurbished part of the hotel perhaps a standard double i d even looked through the 4 photo examples of deuxe rooms provided on booking com and contacted the hotel when i booked asking if it were possible to have a particular room not always possible but worth the ask so essentially i booked this hotel going on the photos provided on the website our room was nothing like those shown and that was very disappointing considering that i could have found this standard of room anywhere very disappointed and wouldn t return or recommend anyone unless i was guaranteed one of the rooms shown on the website to be quite honest i feel we were misled by the photos on the website 
 the staff were pleasant enough but not a wealth of knowledge about restaurants and pubs we made our own bookings the hotel lacked atmosphere and seemed very quiet and serious 
 quite a distance from central amsterdam
 very crowded small rooms when you compare the price paid rooms should be bigger
 the room itself extremely small even the tv didn t fit in front of the bed the mini bar was next to my head when i laid down on my bed the bathroom horrible too booking must show room by room pictures so each customer can really know what are you paying for not nice to see 42 pictures where 20 are from the best room and the rest are miscellaneous photos from a lamp a meal or the city weird thing about the breakfast if you order it from menu is cheaper and more generous than the continental offer same products but cheaper 
 the staff was very unfriendly and once i bought something for breakfast and left it in the room and it was not touched but they just threw it away
 if you don t mind sleeping in a shoebox and you don t mind not being able to walk around the bed it s fine if you d like to move freely and have somewhere to put your suitcase down it s a disaster 
 breakfast was a terrible experience the place was understaffed tables were uncleared and everyone was queuing up to use the only coffee machine available some food were not replenished on time although there are many bread and cakes looks store bought available there is no complimentary water nor hot water kettle available which is something i m not used to the place is a little far from milan central about 20 mins train ride train station is near though 5 mins walking 
 tiny room room was in the basement you could hear the floor creaking upstairs matress had caved in on a side
 the room space available for the cost per night was a bit disappointing especially when seeing the bathroom the netherlands actually has a tourist tax not the hotel s fault just a shock to a clueless american like myself and worth mentioning the hotel s location is kind of far from amsterdam centraal if walking or going by car bus or tram 
 breakfast
 no complaints
 no hot water in the morning but think they had a problem with the boiler as there were also plug in rads in the room was very noisy at 6am when the dustbin lorry came also could hear every time a door in the corridor shut this this is because it is an old hotel 
 a little bit of renovation needed in our bathroom
 nothing 
 the bed was too soft our room was tiny we had a call to the room from a staff member asking if we d ordered food at 4 30am i reported it to reception the next morning and nothing happened 
 we requested all rooms on the same floor and when we left our luggage that was the case but upon return to collect room keys they had moved 1 of our 4 rooms to a completely different floor however this was resolved after speaking to a manager
 the receptionist forgot to check that we ve paid and the tv constantly turned on to remind us that we have to pay until 17 o clock and he woke us several times
 can t really think of a thing there was a fair amount of nearby construction that made getting in out a bit of an inconvenience but obviously that s out of their control 
 no option to get any food or drinks in the hotel it looked like the mini bar cabinet was still to be installed maybe i stayed in the suite 
 it should include breakfast in the rate 12 per person is an expensive extra and the room rate is not cheap 
 toilet was in a very small room still very manageable 
 have to pay for wifi in the room was given twin room when specifically asked for double told that no doubles were available was not informed of this till arrival asked 3 different staff for change but heard nothing back when eventually spoke with manager a room became available no tea coffee facilities in room only 6 sunbeds available around small pool which is looked over by office block
 very small room average breakfast
 one hears the television from next door
 parking only about 10 spaces
 very unpolite lady at frontdesk
 bath water wasn t very hot 
 noise outside when bins emptied
 breakfast could be better for a four star hotel not so much to choose from
 there was no air conditioning in the restaurant in the evening there was about 28c in the restaurant we could barely finish meal 
 more options for breakfast perhaps
 the staff behaviour and the money they taken from my debit card for some authorisation and they told me it going to be back in my account in 4 5 working days now its been about a month but i ve not gt my money back and now they even stop receiving my calls 
 missing towels in the bathroom
 a bit too pricey given the size of the room 
 the ac was not making the room cold enough but that s a general problem in europe however the hotel staff provided us with a fan which was very nice off them 
 be aware that the rooms on the 3rd floor can be really hot in warm summer weather 
 room and bed too small 
 breakfast extra 10 plus extra charge for use of gym 
 too noisy in the room with the ac on so had to turn it off at night we were in the basement so had no window daylight 
 only thing that could be improved is the breakfast service was a little slow and the options could be expanded dinner was a little pricey 
 no complaints abt the hotel at all
 no dine in room service not even for a cup of coffee in the morning shaowers location for the standard room
 rude staff
 a lot of flies around
 nothing
 very small room not good sound proof at all you feel like the window is not closed 
 view from room window could have been nicer but not a big deal 
 room was so small and not even a double bed the bed was right against the wall so had to climb over my husband to use the loo in the night not very impressed for 180 room only room location was not in the main hotel which i wasn t aware of but across the road didn t both with breakfast
 not much of a view but apart from that i couldn t fault the place 
 shower curtain hanging off and long wait for room service
 nothing interesting to visit around the hotel public transport is a bit fat from the hotel 
 pool cold mildrew in bathroom needs a good clean more variety in gym required 
 pool could ve been cleaner full of bird poo 
 the loo was very tight in an alcove very odd
 our room this time was smaller
 wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly wifi poor speed 
 the breakfast was caos the lady on the front desk very rude we were surprised to se this caos as we stayed last year at novotel handburg and althogh it is also a very big hotel it is well organized front desk breakfast etc novotel amsterdam had fissapointed us that much that we will never try a novotel again 
 i should be able to get two face towels if needed it was two of us and i wanted 4 towels and i was not able to but the lady was very nice
 the hotel not have sport club
 no sound proofing between rooms very noisy and breakfast wasn t good
 kettle cable to short and steaming the tv possibly dangerous not enough tea bags sugar and milk 
 no wi fi too far from the center too nosy impossible to open the windows and it s impossible not to open them because it s too stuffy if you need smth from the personal you need to wait for long time the worst is parking it s a space in the cellar where the only normal places are busy by stuff several places for guests don t have normal way out you will need to creep mm by mm to park in and park out because of the passage is too narrow to do it without any risk for your car 
 check in said 3 o clock we arrived at 2 45 and were told the room would be ready by 3 30 as the river view deluxe rooms were a popular choice at 4 o clock we were still waiting having asked again and we did not make it into the room until 4 30 having paid so much for the location and experience this was not the welcome and arrival we were hoping for at all and made the rest of our evening plans rushed and late 
 not much variety in the breakfast not replenished on time 
 room not very clean window leave wind get a bit inside room not too warm air conditioning not provide warm air bathroom need to be refresh
 rooms are too small 
 the initial room allocated was completely unacceptable even though part of a new extension it was very dark looked out over concrete as on 1st floor and needed a map to negotiate the endless twisting narrow corridor and consequently a long trek to the lift wonderful bathroom but its size was at expense of the bedroom we asked for a change but told we had to wait until next day so we did not unpack the receptionist made notes on our requirements next morning we found that no notes had been left for staff so we started all over again we chose a room on 5th floor with light and were told it would be ready by 2 00pm we checked in at 2 45 only to find the room was not made up the receptionist told us she had rescheduled the cleaning for 3 00 pm but didn t inform us we took occupancy at 4 00 pm no apologies along this journey after that things looked up and it was a nice room except the safe deposit box didn t work and our things were locked in for 36 hours and it was an engineering issue not just another client code problem we had stayed at the hotel before which the hotel knew and had been given a very nice room so the original room allocated on this visit was an even bigger disappointment despite the many good points about this hotel we will not go back too risky and too much effort to correct the problem
 the view from the window there was none made it very dull 
 old rooms
 beware the rooms are tiny the ceilings are quite low 
 the lifts were a little erratic 
 room was small less then the 20m2 said there was no mini bar old furniture in the bathroom the windows where with big gaps between them therefore it was cold the objrcts in the bathroom where poorly maintaned as toilet paper dispenser etc 
 booked with double room but it is very tiny for two people no room to relax at all it made me feel breathless when staying in the room as it is too small overall not value the price it was charged
 nothing
 small rooms
 they didn t refund holding deposit 50 on my debit card
 it would be nice to know the ferry times as we weren t sure how often it ran and until what time 
 complimentary bottled water in the room
 staff not over helpful quite a bland atmosphere
 no cider
 unfortunate there was a fire alarm but at least the alarm worked 
 the room was in a terrible condition dirty carpets and shabby walls the room was around 5 feet wide so completely unsuitable for a small family and not fit for purpose more importantly there was an electric socket in the bathroom which not permitted for health and safety reasons
 staff readiness
 can be a bit loud on summer time if you want to open the window hotel is located next to the main road breakfast is delicious but could have a bit more variation 
 room very dark due to wall outside the window lifts very busy air conditioning in room didnt work very well and was noisy towel rail in bathroom very high up above toilet
 we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hilton will always come back again and again
 noisy room even on the 10th floor
 receptionist during check in out a little hard work in communication 
 la grosse lumiere de l immeuble en face de la chambre
 location
 the bedroom is a bit too small 
 no smoking area in hotel had to go out onto street at night for smoke
 nothing really 
 i would prefer for the twin room to have two beds rather than a kingsize bed with two separate mattresses 
 we were put in a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the train station just near the cleaning room which we heard a slamming door all night we changed room with an upgrade which was still at the back of the hotel and same room our friend checked in the same night and asked for an upgrade at check in and she got the best view 
 internet connection was sporadic but they do have a computer one could use 
 disappointing check in on the day of arrival with 2 staff members multitasking completing our details and dealing with incoming phone calls at the same time 
 although its new needs a paint on the walls rooms are nice but just the necessary space no comodities there is a nespresso machine but no coffee nothing interesting around the hotel dead city in the night restaurant was not working we had to order from the turkish guy in the conrner 
 nothing 
 nothing
 view non existent a window up above looked into our room so curtains had to remain closed
 room booked for 3 people but only set up for 2 people so had to make my own bed service charge for bringing drink to table but was asked to sit down and be served breakfast we were taken to a low table and chairs and was rather abrupt with us when we asked for normal set up i ve stayed at the hotel before and was disappointed at this stay 
 the only thing is that i can remark that acoustic wise it s very noisy
 bathroom smelt of drains 
 the wifi wasn t working great but worked for us on and off 
 beds could be softer
 it has a pool yes but what you don t know is that you have to pay 7 per person each time you want to use it it s not free to guests 
 nothing
 the duvet for the extra large queen bed was too small
 bathroom toilet didn t flush water didn t drawn from sink shower very well 
 boring breakfast the cleaning ladies spoke spanish to us very fast although we didn t understand i word
 poor food overpriced poorly stocked bar hotel required attention attention to detail sadly lacking poor organisation for breakfast service dinner was poor significantly overcooked 
 it s right next to the tram so we can hear the tram all the time even we asked for quite room at 8f 
 breakfast buffet was ok compared to other hotels of this calibre 
 the concierge change everyday the carpet in the room did not seem clean enough the air conditioning was leaking through the false ceiling i have stayed at better hotels 
 breakfast was by far the worst that i ve experienced in some time completely disorganized and chaotic buffet dishes not stocked food not restocked no orientation directions given by staff my table was even given away to another guest after i initially sat also on check in no attention had been paid to my advances requests
 we did not like a shower curtain for shower a shower screen door would have stopped a cold shower curtain sticking to ones skin 
 room on floor under the roof very low
 nothing
 room rate
 kids swimming classes are given in the pool so its noisy and full of kids elevator is so slow room is extremly slow wifi cuts off sometimes 
 nothing
 rooms were smaller than i expected
 breakfast overpriced with no eggs and the so called terrace in our room with half dead ivy watering constantly making it a mosquito nest the service of rooms is approximate 
 size of room
 bathroom could have been better more shelves and leaky shower glass curtain 
 service charge added to bar bill should be discretionary 
 expensive
 no shreddies or weetabix or porridge for breakfast 
 parking expensive
 slow wifi
 on this occasion most of the tv stations were not working this was not a massive issue as out sightseeing most of the time 
 faded glory lovely chandelier in the room but with wallpaper peeling off stained chairs and marked carpet it was a tired looking room if it was an upgrade to executive i would not fancy the standard room 
 there is only one bottle of complimentary mineral water for a twin bedroom the bedroom is a bit small 
 rooms smaller than expected
 room a little small
 i was disgusted the price did not include breakfast the price of breakfast was very expensive if you were prepared to pay for it
 staff was arrogant racist and incopetent check in should be from 2pm onward arrived at 3 30 and still had to wait for half an hour for my room and later for another 90minutes for a crib which i had requested on my reservation no apologies no excuses just arrogant staff phone was broken room was small unclean nothing about this hotel was 4 stars at all 2 at most staff treated muslim guests very poorly check out took over 30 minutes with many people waitinf at check out time noon and only one staff at the front desk all in all a terrible experience and would never recommend it to anyone least incopetent and slow people can do is smile and apologise not treat guests like they are doing them a favour 
 the heater wasn t enought to keep the room warm the door from the bathroom durty and dust the conners by the shower boxe very disgusting 
 housekeeping was inconsistent sometimes the complimentary water and body lotion wasn t replaced 
 i contacted the hotel when booking apron 6 weeks before travelling to say that we required a high room as wanted a brill view which we got i also explained that it was to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary nothing was acknowledged about this not even a couple of chocolates on the pillows i know everyone is budget cutting but for goodness sake a couple of chocs on the pillows would have made us realise that you actually took interest in us and our special weekend but no that was a disappointment the drawers in the room didn t shut once clothes were put in them so dread going to the loo in the night the bathroom really does need a shuttable door not the sliding door that doesn t even meet the edge and has no lock whatsoever i know we ve been married 30 years but i have never pooped within earshot of my hubby without a proper closeable door being there basics really get the drawers sorted get the bathroom door sorted and i would consider returning 
 rooms small stayed in a basement room 8 very noisy as staff room was opposite no air con so had window open quite noisy 
 english breakfast would be nice since the price of the hotel is quite expensive
 we requested a quiet room but were awoken early each morning by the noisy cleaning staff as their storage cupboard was opposite our room 808 they appeared to ignore our do not disturb sign walls between rooms are thin and room doors close noisily 
 lift to small that s the main issue
 we thought champagne bar prices were a little high 
 bedroom was quite small for a 4 star coffee at breakfast was the filter type could do with some self service coffee machines i used to use this hotel a lot in the past but now it s only budget standard times have moved on 
 biscuits in the room
 room was not ready on time 
 1 we book a room with twin bed i travelled with my friend but in fact there was a double bed in the room wich was not such a big problem if they had two blankets on it but they didn t i went downstairs and asked for a blanket but they brought a plaid of some artificial material seriuosely how would we use it instead of a blanket well we had to take the sheet that we removed from the bed to cover the plaid to make it possible to sleep under it at all and slept on the bed without a sheet 2 there was horribly noisy in the room there is a very buisy street outside always full of cars and trams plus the tubes in the hotel made some loud and annoying noise from time to time all night long i think they just put us into the worst room they had because i booked with a big discount if i knew that the discount meant lack of quality i would never save money on the comfort in fact even with the discount the hotel didn t worth the money we spent on it 
 that we couldn t stay longer
 pillows too low and hard for me
 we were unable to get a drink at the bar due to it being full and were advise to have a drink in the lobby once down in the lobby we were advised to drink in the bar
 my only slight dislike was that the pillows although nice and deep are way too soft for my preference which as a side sleeper meant that i needed 3 pillows to achieve the correct height to support my head and neck the downside to this was that due to how deep yet soft and puffy the pillows are i ended up with my head deeply recessed in the pile of pillows which at times felt a little claustrophobic on the plus side though at least they felt generally comfortable and didn t make my neck ache in the great scheme of things though it was a fairly minor thing and in fairness to the hotel it s possible that if i d asked they may have been able to supply firmer pillows i don t know if that s the case though as when we arrived back at the hotel it was late and i was tired so just wanted to sleep therefore i didn t actually ask 
 there is no restaurants near the hotel and souna needs update 
 very unpredictable wifi often didn t work at all 
 there was no iron in room and only one in the entire hotel
 really poor wifi connection all rooms have samsung tv so if you have samsung phone you have the facility to mirror your screen but due to bad wifi it never works really bad wifi no tv channels are in english so your stuck with bbc news no facility to change audio
 the bedroom doors could be on a restrictor so they wouldn t make such a noise throughout the night just couldn t cope with the noise any longer
 nothing this was my second stay there
 the cost was much more that other hotels of similar standard in the area i was charged more than was quoted by booking com and a prepayment was taken from my bank account a month before our arrival the first two nights we spent there were in a very small basement room where we could not even open the frig or wardrobe as the bed was wedged against them the staff originally refused to move us to a room that was pictured on your website and our booking sheet i would not have booked the tiny room we were given and only after explaining the misrepresentation were we changed for the last 3 nights of the stay 
 twin beds are not comfortable 
 prices in restaurant
 it needs a small renovation for a 4 star hotel wallpaper and details like toilet and shower door has to be removed 
 could have been a little cheaper although i realise it is central london 
 i do dislike the entrance a lot horrible what the redocoration did with the big hall white tiles all over also the rooms have had an update but not the right one they had done a better job when they restored the old furniture and just got new bathrooms and new carpets its is a shame to distroy the old rare interior with chaep ikea like wooden shelfs and wardropes 
 breakfast could be more atrractive more variety of food serve 
 no problem at all
 room had no view
 facilities and location
 nothing
 airconditioning was broken rooms are too warm no good pillows hard and synthetic fabric employees made a mistake early in the morning for getting my luggage wasnt for me they also send me to a restaurant what was closed the costs were appr eur 70 higher then agreed through bookinsg com
 we d usually leave the room around 10am explore the city and get back around 5 6pm at which point our room would still not have been clean housekeeping would then turn up between 6 and 7 which seems way later than anywhere else we ve ever stayed at this time we want to relax and get ready before heading out for the evening but the guys cleaning the room there was a window in our room but it overlooked other windows we booked two single beds but got a double had been travelling all day so didn t bother mentioning this but wouldbhave been nice if they got it right the hotel looks a bit dated in the cooridoors 
 hotel signs were not evident that it was radission blue edwardian i drove past it four times no parking
 nothing at all
 road works caused a major problem with taxi getting to front of hotel cost us an extra 50 in fares over three fares hotel
 little bit dusty on the bed nearest the window windows outside not very clean 
 cleaners came knocking on the door at 7 30 in the morning and again at 10 30 they should have a list with check outs especially for people only staying one night 
 wait time to check in arrived and has to wait to check in only 3 out of 5 checkin desks were available room was okay though quite basic for 5 in mayfair very clean not much character in the hotel seemed quite cold mayfair kitchen was amazing and staff very professional and friendly however the ending was extremely disappointing i reported my necklace from my wedding day and my bracelet missing and i m still waiting for a call back it s appalling both extremely sentimental pieces of jewellery and not one member of staff cares or has taken ownership of this and i have spoken to the duty manager house keeping and fitness centre i m extremely upset about this experience and wouldn t expect this level of service from any hotel but certainly not the mayfair hotel in london worse of all we were staying there as it was our wedding anniversary and i left without my wedding jewellery 
 blanlets pillows were heavily smelling medicine odor we claimed but new blankets pillows were given a day after we had to suffer one night as there was no other room available blankets pillows can not be changed with clean ones as room service was closed after 8pm 
 a bit expensive but worth it for a treat weekend or when you are working hard and need somewhere to relax 
 early check out
 breakfast should have more vegetables
 food poor quality in evening wouldn t advise eating here
 really tiny detail there were 2 of us in the room and the cleaning staff only gave us 1 regular nespresso pod and one decaf maybe make sure to leave 2 of each for rooms of 2 people really not the biggest deal but something to think about 
 no fridge if you want good wi fi you have to pay for it it was cold in the room elevator only to the floor and then you have to go up a narrow staircase
 while the restaurant food was excellent it took longer than i would have liked
 wi fi is bad towels could have been changed in every two days extra blanket is needed 
 direct transport link from the hotel to the city centre either by bus h16 2 minutes from the hotel or metro l3 12 minutes walking from the hotel however it does take 40 45 min by bus to get to placa catalunya so the location may not be your first choice if it was your first time in barcelona presumably you d like to spend a bit more time wandering in the city centre 
 it was a bit pricey and it would have felt better value if breakfast had been included in the price
 very small rooms 
 we reserved a twin room and were given a single bed staff at reception was not the friendliest
 guests should be informed that they need to check in and out at the hotel across the street
 room service was poor limited options and premise food no gym
 the toilet in the deluxe room is very small 
 nothing
 we had some bad experience with the staff i had booked superior double room king size bed i notified the hotel about out arrival 2 days before arrival that we will arrive in the middle of the night between 1 2 a m and that i would like their confirmation that they know about it and that our booked room is booked for sure i got their e mail confirming that the room with the king size bed is waiting for us when we arrive in the night but when we arrived the receptionist said that they don t have that room and they can only give us twin room we tried to explain that i have confirmation etc but nothing to do of course we were tired from travelling and took that room for first night to get some sleep as i am pregnant too the room was super small and actually seemed not cleaned properly as well in the morning i was explained that it does not matter what room i book they will give the available room i was not satisfied because i had paid more to get king size bed room and after talking to different people we were given bigger room with double bed i still don t know whether it was with king size bed or not they did not agree to reduce our fee for staying in smaller twin room either the bigger room was great and clean satisfied with that but still got quite bad experience 
 area for breakfast slightly small a bit chaotic when all guest arrive at same time 
 nothing staff was amazing 
 too noisy you can hear the tram and people from the streets you hear every opened and closed door or even your neighbors not reallly sound proofed 
 really cant think of anything sensible 
 all great
 breakfast was expensive and mediocre and breakfast waiter surly
 nothing we didn t like
 limited access to the spa facilities not as advertised 
 small rooms specially when have babystroller had stairs in the hallway and in the room not ideal for us 
 wifi was okay on the ground or below ground level not great bathroom was okay very clean though 
 breakfast too extensive
 was easy access into central amsterdam but would like to have been a little closer
 rooms too hot at night ambient temperature too high and felt putting air conditioning on in march a waste of money and not very environmentally friendly 
 soft furnishings had been upgraded but decor and hard furnishings were worn bathroom fittings needed replacing breakfast limited and not worth the price
 this is the worst stay at a so called 5 hotel i ever had very unfriendly staff small rooms never again 
 not really a problem but the room we stayed in was on the 4th floor and no lifts not a spring chicken anymore to climb all those stairs also no towel rail by the sink to hang your towel on or a shelf to put your bits and pieces on but they are minor details as we had a great stay 
 bad wifi
 
 very expensive for the type of room provided quite dated 
 the check in process was appalling for a hotel of the standard after a significant delay our room was below the standard that we expected and was situated exactly where we asked not to be it took 5 hours to be allocated to the correct room and this ruined our first day 
 to small
 one small wardrobe and no drawers 
 although public transportaiton and bicycles are available a little farther from the city center 
 well there s no lift but you know that in advance there s no surprise and there s always someone on hand to help with luggage 
 the rooms were pathetic the corridor smelled the bathroom smelled 
 the bar staff two ladies were slow and unfriendly i had to wait for a fairly long time to order a drink and although staff appeared to be doing other things they did not say hello or acknowledge my existence the outside bar seating was unclean and the tables had not been cleared empty glasses and bottles on tables the floor needed a sweep and the seating and tables a wipe over this area really let the hotel down this was observed on three occasions and at each time the bar was fairly empty and thus staff could have had a clear up 
 the modern designed bathroom offers no privacy at all in a family room plus our room had a theme of a vineyard whose owner s looks are challenged his photo was placed so that he kept looking at us taking a bath it was eery 
 bar area and service could be improved e g more on offer for evening activity 
 little not to like no laundry bag in room is the only negative
 the hotel is located on the 8th floor and the rooms are on the 6th and 7th floors all other floors are apartments getting to the rooms isn t that straight forward but manageable the air conditioning heating system seems a little too complex for some people and i couldn t see any room service options local diner or takeaway menus would be a nice touch for food options for late arrivals 
 nothing 
 nothing
 further from points of interest like anne frank house and we were on foot for most of the time 
 nothing 
 as we were two adults and one child we chose the option two double beds in one room i know there is an option of king size but frankly the double beds in the room were really really small as in narrow also there could be a better selection or at least a better description of the selection on the childrens menu in the restaurant 
 even a superior room is quite small but that s london hotels
 everything was ok
 nothing
 the air conditioning was chilling and could not be regulated in each bedroom like spending 5 days in a freezer there are no restaurants or bars in the surroundings and the personnel can t give you much info on practically anything
 appalling cleanliness filthy windows parts chewed or broken off bathroom door leaking shower empty minibar no free wifi lifts insufficient for the number of guests pricey and bad quality food was glad to leave 
 poor and small breakfast
 the fact that there was no daylight in the room faced the narrow high backyard in the middle of the building very noisy during the night when you hear everything because there is a loud airconditioning machine for the whole building breakfast to expensive t
 no coffee tea making facility in the room 
 the size of room too small and not value for money 
 nothing
 thin walls and doors you can hear noise from the corridor and your neighbour the silicone in the shower need to be refreshed black spots it poor breakfast 
 didn t find a place to read like the executive lounge it tend to be for members only 
 far from center quality of breakfast products a little kitschy 
 dust all over the work surfaces booking com did not make it clear at all the the hotel would charge 45 per night for parking and put on our booking that we could get it cheaper which the hotel refused meaning we parked on the street behind which lead to our window getting smashed myself and my partner are well dressed and presentable however young and we re stopped several times and asked to prove we were actually staying at the hotel as it was hotel policy even though other guests were not stoped the bathroom was beautiful but i felt unclean and smelt would only stay here again for the view 
 the room service was very expensive small portions and lacking in flavor
 i have stayed here a few times and the decoration is definitely needing to be looked at but if you are hardly in your room that doesn t really matter 
 very bad smell in the bathroom 
 nothing
 breakfast bacon leathery both days sausages excellent though mortadella salad listed but no longer available no rioja in stock 
 room service a bit slow 
 the elevators were really small but there were 6 of them available all the time our queen bed sagged a little in the middle but pillows were decent 
 my room was located on the first floor right above the hotel s bar where they played loud music all night which made it impossible to sleep with all that noise
 room size standard room was a bit tight but it worked for 3 nites
 nothing
 buffet breakfast not including enough stuff for diabetics 
 the room could ve used a bit more lighting the view of our room was a construction site which wasn t very pleasant the rooftop pool was pretty small but still nice 
 no kettle in the room though there was a coffee machine 
 price
 room too cold the window was not double glass bed too short for an average size person check out at 11am without the possibility to delay a bit 
 nothing all was good 
 nothing
 a few issues with one of our rooms ipad not working phone didn t ring until replaced and bed draw not opening and closing sorted after 3 visits but better if fixed from the off 
 cost far too expensive in my opinion
 air con in one of our rooms didn t work very well 
 very poor breakfast and room service menu
 our room was clean but a bit shabby it was in a quiet part of the hotel which was good but it was very gloomy as the decor is dark and there was not much natural light there was a water leak from the room above us in the bathroom but that was fixed after reporting it it was a bit of a concern as it was dripping through a light fitting generally we thought the hotel needed a bit of tlc to be worthy of a 4star hotel rating 
 parking is not the easiest however they have a garage where parking costs 21 eur night 
 the design concept it felt dated and tacky 
 better lift access to top floor bathrooms a little squeezy
 wash basin not practical long and shallow glass door to toilet caught on tiles would have liked a neck support pillow would have liked a night light in bathroom
 small room and toilet very nosey can hear from other rooms
 need could have been more comfortable and the room was very noisy a combination of a bathroom fan that never went off and proximity to the lifts 
 very small rooms
 everything was perfect 
 if anything the bathroom was a little cramped 
 mini bar or fridge in room would have been good 
 bar closes too early in the evenings bar decor was a bit shabby and tired single room although comfortable i felt in an exposed and remote situation at the back of the hotel the double lock on the door did not work and the safety chain could easily be broken if door forced 
 nothing
 i did not like the balcony not a nice view and a shame you could not really go into it i could not see any clear access to any garden space wise it could definetly have been bigger not enough room outside of the bed 
 elevater
 was not that clean bath was dirty so were the sheets i ended p getting my sleeping bag out of my car to sleep on constantly called reception for room service and they did not pick up at all 
 the hotel looks as if it s a 2 star hotel the drains smell there wasn t any pair of slippers in the room towels and bathroom tools were old 
 unfriendly stuff the room was not cleaned the floor with a slope bad smell in the room bad bed
 lots of lights flashing in the room from the air conditioning switch the fire alarm and the tv standby light didn t sleep very well on either nights we stayed 
 nothing
 price a little expensive
 the room service food could be improved 
 old fashion for a 4 stars hotel 
 nothing
 the room was tiny the shower as tiny it was overpriced 
 very pricey room without breakfast over easter price was steep irrelevant it was easter for us as we only stayed as nearby daughter had new baby pool was outside and round the corner shut at 5 30pm when we stayed pool small crowded and up freezing public stairs husband told had to pay 5 for locker padlock very disappointing as we hoped pool would be main relaxation for us no moving or magnifying mirror in bathroom obviously really meant for business men on expense accounts 
 we were in the bar area having a coffee soft drink with my 6 year old son it was only 8 oopm but there were adults in there being excessively loud and using offensive language so we had to move seats maybe polite notices could be displayed 
 nothing 
 breakfast 2 10
 a lot of stairs to get the the third floor the room door would not lock and the air conditioning was broken hopefully both have now been repaired
 built in cupboards very dark brown overbearing needs lightening
 extra bed in the family room wasn t very comfortable guess what bathrooms and toilets had no locks from inside in a family room 
 perhaps we are easily pleased but cannot think of anything dusliked
 the hot parts of breakfast needed to be kept hotter fried eggs were never hot 
 i originally booked hotel at the end of last year a few days before our visit the exact same holiday was 140 cheaper would have liked a room at the front of the hotel like last year not the one we had looking at a building site and work in progress the windows needed a bit of a clean as well 
 the bed was meant to be kingsize but it was 2 mattresses put together it was meant to be an executive room and it was small and dark and nothing like the pictures 
 we had to take the breakfast in a ball room there were too many peope in the hotel the capacity of the normal breakfast room was not enough nevertheless the breakfast was great 
 no washing facilities for muslims in toilets 
 check in was from 3pm but the room wasn t ready until 5pm 
 wasn t a twin bedroom available although i had especially requested it and called hotel twice about it so had to share a bed with my sister slept badly
 breakfast not included 
 the don t have an english tv channel
 better choice of beers at the bar
 nothing
 an additional set o curtains would be very helpful to sleep longer in the morning 
 nothing
 value of the money is a high 
 would be difficult to find anything better no complaints
 can t think of anything 
 nothing
 car parking charges are huge 40 for 24 hours we paid 64 for 28 hours
 we were on honeymoon and got upgraded but we heard that many guests also got an upgrade so we dont feel we got any special treatment problem with heating in the room but staff responsive and helpful so eventually ok 
 better care tv set a bar 
 the lack of electrical outlets in the bathroom distressed my husband who uses an electric shaver 
 foyer very small for size of hotel with not much seating room had vent flapping in barhroom ceiling with wind tv didnt work in room afternoon tea snacks very over priced for where it was served which was in foyer 
 the standard rooms that we got had very small windows which the property s description conveniently doesn t show on the site so avoid rooms from the second floor if possible since all of them are with windows like in the attached image besides this the whole 2nd story floor squeaks both in the hallway and in the rooms overall the whole refurbishment that was done to the hotel seems on the cheap side in room bar was empty you need to actually ask for a refill at the reception it doesn t seem like a 4 star hotel except for the breakfast i am really wondering how when it received it s 4 star rating 
 bed was uncomfortable
 check out time could have been longer and the cost of extras was expensive 
 not a short walk from the train station
 elevator did not work rooms are small but this was not a disadvantage for me the available space at floor level compensates
 dirty bed cloths half used wine bottle nothing done once reception was made aware
 facilities are a bit too old for an 8 2 review score
 free wifi should be available throughout the hotel
 breakfast was a little overpriced for us so we opted out and ate out each morning the evening staff were a little unwelcoming but we were greeted by a lovely lady when we checked in 
 the noise factor i asked for a quiet room but was up till early hours of the morning not being able to sleep for 18 the breakfast is pathetic and the breakfast staff are not on the ball sometimes there were no knives and forks nor spoons once they got used up and tables were not cleared quickly enough on some of the days 
 inefficient check in process no up front warning about closed access road no valet parking small poorly equipped room no bath smallish bed poor view for the price 
 everything was fine 
 slightly depressed ambience thin pillows on a hard bed 
 nothing massive just decor abit dark in room
 it was far from city center and there are no shops around hotel to buy something in night i booked room with 1 big bed but i got 2 single beds which was later changed to 1 bed but as a favor to me 
 everything was great ok maybe the isolation from outside noise probably not as bad on non euro soccer nights 
 bed mattress wasn t comfort as other standard hotel one day no room cleaning service 
 bedroom was too hot and air conditioning did not work
 paying for parking after you pay a good price for the room as a guest you think it would be free as it s there car park 
 air conditioning was not working
 the cost of the breakfast should be included in the total cost when booking 
 nothing
 i really can t think of a bad word that could be said we loved our stay 
 would have been nice if there was a lounge to sit with bar somewhere on entrance unfortunately the lounge bar upstairs was busy with a function 
 very difficult to find 
 elevater maintenance all the time
 the room was shabby and drab the carpet was stained and grubby and the furnishings were not comfortable also there was only one socket in the room to use for any electrical items i expected a much higher standard from the novotel brand 
 room was slightly to the tired side although everything was ok there were features that looked really tired 
 expensive breakfast and not a great selection and overall quite expensive
 bathroon need a make up
 wifi kept dropping signal and there is no lobby at all to sit i a bit hard to locate 
 the decorations and carpet in the corridors to the rooms were very tired and in need of updating or a good clean it was a concern walking to the room as to what we would be greeted with but the room was amazing and very modern 
 service at front desk upon reception
 towels bed sheet
 no private parking at the time of stay i wish i knew that before booking a room in this hotel anyway there s enough free parking space on the streets around the hotel wi fi is available but it s not very fast and reliable 
 the first room we got was extremely tiny and looked very run down in the second room we couldn t figure out how to turn off the heating air con and as a result the room was too warm through the night the radiator in the bathroom was also on high which made the whole room warm and sticky the room itself was still very small and nothing about it looked like any of the photos from the website 
 the cleanliness could be improved on day 3 housekeeping only made the bed and didn t clean the bathroom just wiped a bit i complained about it but i guess they went back to wipe a bit and not real clean had breakfast there 4 times but not sure it s a good value for money in terms of choice 
 at the end of the stay you have to pay taxes on top of the price you payed on booking com its never mentioned not on the website not on booking com not when you check in only when you checkout be careful and don t order a taxi from the concierge price is about 15 20 higher rated then normal ones
 the shower system didn t like the faucet 
 no parking
 terrible service
 can t think of anything
 extremely high bed with uncomfortable mattress rude waitresses in the lobby cafe cozy looks but the room didn t really feel cozy 
 nothing property was exactly i supposed in your communication 
 i reported a theft of 4000 euro from our room u did nothing i talked to my embassy in rome they told me that the hotel administration should call the police to file a report and start invistigation u did nothing we lost our money in our 25th anivirsary of our marriage i must till the whole world about that 
 room was a bit noisy as this was situated a few floors above the outside smoking area of the bar 
 the trap in the basin pulled a couple times and the smell from the drains entered the bathroom it needs a vent installing to prevent reoccurrence and it may be a problem in other rooms i made the booking but my wife travelled separately from dorset and arrived before i did on probably the hottest day of the year and tired from the journey she was initially refused check in and entry into the room only after complaining to the duty manager was she permitted entry 
 nothing
 it was overpriced
 the maid woke us up at 9am wanting to make up the room 
 we had made 2 special requests in our pre booking i e arrival time 9 10 00 hours and a quiet room with an extra large bed none of these requests were granted we were given a small room with a small bed and noisy air conditioning it took us 4 hours to be relocated to a decent room 
 room size very small but the view is good to the tower
 the rooms require renovation 
 wi fi erratic mosquitos in lobby 
 the small double was quite warm
 the staff are 100 eastern european which have lack of customer service the word please is not exist and mostly they are rude air condition is not working everywhere and they will unlock the window which is doesnt sound right the internet is not working most of the time plus you have to pay for it and once you call the reception to solve the internet issue they tell you to call the internet provider 
 our belongings were held to ransom at 1am as the check in staff had charged us an incorrect rate we were not even allowed to collect our belongings and leave until we paid more 
 the view from our room 
 beds were not soft and luxurious
 a bit picky but the tea cups should be cleaned daily 
 i asked a girl at reception desk to call a taxi to the airport giving a card with taxi details one day before check out the taxi did not come an another taxi was called for me since i always go to the airport in advance there was no problem 
 location was nt animated area away from restaurants the beach and the olympic port but many transport options car metro even suburban
 the room furniture in the junior suits and other big sweets is the same make me wonder it it was worth it paying more just for some extra space but same furniture tv in the living rook was kinda small 
 bathrooms needing renovation busy lobby it s like a market square generally lacking relaxation areas outside of the room 
 the shower didnt drain away as fast as it came out had to use towels to dry up the extra water 
 a bit inconvenient location for public traffic options no internet
 small rooms poor and ticketed wi fi access
 only thing was the air conditioning barcelona is too warm to be living in a warm room the temperature of the room does not get lower than 23 degrees when we asked the front desk they said to assist in getting in colder for us but nothing happened all the times we asked nothing changed the location of the hotel is not exactly convenient but there was a taxi stand 1 minute away and we managed to get taxis whenever we were out of the hotel 
 room was in the basement of the hotel it was extremely noisy above the room at times in the morning there was a staff member being given a dressing down outside my door 
 all was good nothing to complain about 
 size of the room
 bed linen was dirty air conditioning did not work
 the room was horrible noisy and overlooking garbage yard never again
 no shower curtain 
 being insulted by the receptionist when checking in post brexit rudeness
 in our double room the bed was composed of two single beds put together so that was less convenient 
 i booked a twin room and also rang day before to ensure got twin beds which i was told i would when checked in there were none and i said i was happy to have roll away bed was given room that could accommodate but there were no roll away beds i could have booked another place a lot cheaper with twin beds and specifically checked with hotel so i could cancel if not available they said i would get so i feel ripped off 
 no electricity was a real nuisance 
 our only negative was that there were no tea making facilities in the room 
 nothing bad to say 
 bathrooms small but adequate for a short stay 
 expensive no shade on rooftop 
 shower room to small 
 there was an electric wire hitting our window for 4 days lock from bathroom door fell out of the door 
 the prices are a little bit high and for this quality it should be included breakfast the breakfast was so expensive and we had it at the outside there are many places to go nearby the hotel for the breakfast also there should be slippers in the room and using bathrobe had extra fee it was so weird 
 bathroom was extremely tight had to sit down to use sink due to it was not very wide 
 sound isolation 
 location was far from shops 
 breakfast room a little small
 getting to the room was a little complicated as the hotel has a few different parts 
 wi fi signal is not very strong and you need to login all the time 
 when we arrived we were charged city tax no mention of this in the booking also charged a 100 euro deposit which wasn t mentioned 
 breakfast could be improved
 one morning with total chaos in the restaurant 
 small room
 room on the 5th floor and the lift not going to the 5th got to the room with our luggage and the key would not work so a long trip back to reception 
 none
 no bar facilities just a small reception area to site
 in the room there was no bottled water no coffee maker room was very small 
 the menu is expensive
 spa is not good enough for a 5 star hotel neither is the gym breakfast should be included but only provided full english breakfast included
 in my room sometimes the facial basin is not in proper use need to wait for the water to flow down ordered room service for the foie gras but got to eat the beet steak instead some smell like drain or something in the room after we back from outside housekeeper was forgot to give us the shampoo and shower cream for almost everyday and we need to call for it whenever we need to take a shower 
 nothing
 staff 
 not close to any shopping all payments must be made in which is very inconvenient and costly for those of us who carry us 
 prefer not to have room serviced but in spite of hanging notice on door was woken from a nap by housekeeping who also entered room in my absence 
 an armchair in the room would have been good 
 the hotel is in desperate need of modernisation the bed quality was poor
 every ting was good
 water flowed out while showering 
 it s far away from the city centre rooms are small
 the staff at the poolside bar were very very slow and kept forgetting orders then getting order wrong 
 swimming pools were both too cold 
 staff at lunch a bit miserable and slow breakfast needed a bit of table service i got asked if i wanted tea or coffee but neither were bought had to wait a long time for some bacon and sausage 
 the bar prices would have loved a coat hook in the room 
 everything was excellent
 floor i stayed on was being decorated by the looks of it floor in my room had paint stains on the floor and bathroom had unfinished areas to it also room had sight smell of cheap cleaning products not a fresh pleasant smelling room 
 i booked a twin bedded room as i was meant to be staying at the hotel with a friend not my partner the twin beds were right beside each other my friend was unable to come with me so my partner took her place so it was fine for us but would have been a bit too cramped for two friends sharing the room 
 the service is terrible they first said they would change the bedding in my tiny single room then later 10 30pm said that they were unable to provide non feather pillows and when asked are rude about it and i quote we are a hotel we do not cater for allergies i contacted the hotel before writing this review and gave them 10 days to respond and they haven t so i don t think customer service is anything they really care about if you have an allergy stay away 
 nothing
 already said in above review
 nothing
 my wife didn t sleep well because the bed wasn t comfortable and we did have a room service dinner which sincerely was nothing to write home about total waste of money and cersar salad was bad taste but apart from that nice place to stay less i forget if you driving it s going to cost you 40 a day to park and if you use the 2hour s parking time restricted bays it cost you 6 an hour 
 parking is slightly expensive
 not cheap but worth it 
 the air conditioning working comfier beds and duvets frozen potatoes
 the gym needs to open earlier and close later parking should be free the bathroom has a window so anyone in room can see not ideal when sharing
 the bed is a bit small but nothing significant 
 the room was a bit stuffy bed was smaller than expected 
 only details that aren t worth mentioning
 entire hotel is 100 heating or cooling our room was unbearably hot making it difficult to sleep the hotel could not resolve the issue as the hotel was on heat only they also would not accommodate us changing rooms very frustrating 
 room seemed a bit bare and lacked character pillows could have been better 
 no free wi fi for a 5star hotel no soundproof rooms nor privacy
 room little cramped no windows to open hence no air bit tight for space
 just 1 lift to the floor s 
 beds hard need self closing toile seats 
 if this didn t happen then i would rate the property as 10 the time i arrived the hotel i was given a different price for my total stay with an increase in money for each night it is a different price than when i booked at booking com i was told that it is not an option and the total price has been changed i was also told that it was mentioned in booking com however i always use booking and never saw such a message before and never had this kind of experience 
 room to hot and a musty couldn t open a window had an ironing room which was just awful really needs a revamp
 there s not much wrong when visiting this hotel it s pretty central with good transport links excellent for the nou camp i would say that the area could do with a few more international food outlets close by that s all 
 misleading room type while booking booked interior room which means windows face the wall but for the hotel apparently interior room means super tiny bed not suited for 2 people tried to change but staff was very rude especially the old guy on the reception did not sleep the whole night as the bed is too small and it s too hot to breath in the room the next day apparently there were no free rooms changed for last 2 nights and were charged extra it s not the first time staying in this hotel plus recommended to our friends will never go back
 the rooms were minute and a little shabby there is no bar or restaurant on the premises which you would expect in a hotel 
 still getting used to having to climb over my partner to get out of bed
 the a c in the room did not work as well as in the other hotels i ve been to and it was very loud also i did not quite understand why there is a window that you can see the other person sittin on the toilet while you are lying in bed you could shut the window but still there was some holes in it 
 room on a low ground basement although with exterior light window standard breakfast included but continental breakfast is paid extra at breakfast to get a cappuccino 3 70 pounds extra charge 
 felt a little rip off style water in room not complimentary room tiny would not expect a room that small i have tried many hotels in london as i frequently visit and although reception bar etc fabulous the room was disapointing
 the breakfast just avoid it the view to a wall hence the curtain down all the time the lift for max two persons 
 it felt like sleeping in a basement with a small shower toilet facilities even though it was an upgrade to the suite i personally felt that the pictures were taken at a rather advantageous angle 
 could have done with an extra pillow in the room but a very small quibble
 nothing
 reception staff very helpful unfortunately the bar foyer staff were not 
 bed
 thought choice at continental breakfast could have been better 
 nothing
 no complaints
 no tissue boxes in the rooms and not easy to get which bothered us no iron as well so we couldn t iron our clothes if needed
 a little bit leakage in the bathroom 
 reception staff at the spar were appalling they were disorganised unprofessional and behaved in a couldn t care a less attitude they were rude unhelpful and totally tarnish the quality brand of the radison i m assuming they are a seperate organisation to the hotel 
 price relatively high housekeeping service only until 11pm which cause a bit inconvenient
 the breakfast was a bit of a nightmare you were provided coffee by servers who were apparently not trained to take orders there is a breakfast buffet and so ordering toast alone the first day required consultation with the maitre d and several confirmations as later in the day servers were quite well trained couldn t quite figure out why the breakfast was unusual 
 receptionist was kind of rude the room was very nice but very hot and there was only one old fan that wasn t working properly the parking price they offered wasnt true they charged me double for one day 
 none maybe okay not special continental breakfast but we preferred to have breakfast outside 
 room was a little cramped and lighting was dim but there were many lamps and it had all facilities far from the major tourist attractions but as previously mentioned it s close to a metro so only a minor inconvenience 
 problem with the bath no hot water too much noise
 nothing it was great 
 we felt the breakfast was not worth the high price
 bar was shut due to refurb
 the staff were a bit snotty but i think it s that kind of place it s a shame they think it s ok to charge for wifi and have such a draconian policy to the minibar
 the room was a little too compact and the shower was very awkward to adjust some of the tech is a bit gimmicky and doesn t really offer much benefit 
 the room was very out dated shower barely worked room just about fitted the double bed in it could have got the same in a b b bed for one night at budget price for gig at hyde park anything more and there would have been a complaint for sure 
 too expensive for the size of the room we had room service and we were given the wrong food 
 nothing really to dislike
 non
 the wifi was spotty at best there was no shelf or caddy in the shower so you had to hold your soap or shampoo in hand while taking one there was also no control over temperature so it got very hot by morning or if you left the windows open there was no screen so some bugs would get in 
 noting really 
 we selected to stay at the regina for our last four nights after a month stay in france we had high expectations since this is a 5 star hotel but sadly we were extremely disappointed it was a really sad end to an otherwise amazing time in paris and france when we arrived the room was nice but in a very poor location there was no view and the noise level from the hotel staff was outrageous on one day we counted ten times hotel staff slammed doors outside our room there was constant noise from the hallway from staff and from outside our room with things clanging crashing we might have been near the hotel bar or restaurant it was not acceptable there was no hot water in the shower in our room when we arrived we called the front desk twice to get someone to look at it the night manager checked it and confirmed it was broken we were offered a smaller room on a lower floor in a less desirable location for the same price no less or wait until morning to have it fixed we thought the offer was pretty ridiculous so we opted to have it repaired in the morning we were told someone would arrive between 8am 9am to fix it no one showed up so at 9 30 we called and someone finally showed up at about 10 15 he got it to work but only minimally so we were not offered another room or any discount on our room the water was lukewarm at best with no water pressure whatsoever the staff were polite but very slow to respond we had to call four times to get towels and when they arrived at our room they did still did not have what we requested they constantly entered our room even when the light outside our room was red indicating we wanted privacy and did not want our room serviced when the green light indicating service was wanted no one showed up we had to call to request service we called to complain about the noise and the fact that the shower was still not functioning properly 
 we upgraded to an executive room but there was no dressing table area with a mirror i had to use a really low table in front of the long mirror for my makeup etc also the safe didn t work even after someone came and looked at it tv was tiny and bad reception hair dryer missing from room but was provided straight away when asked for 
 difficult for taxis to access the property 
 bearkfast and room amount was to high for the room
 the price of the beer 
 room was very small shower was difficult to even move in it was that tiny some of the plugs in the room were broken kettle had to be on the floor to connect to a plug 
 no fridge in the room
 beds very soft hot water way too hot room sink did not drain properly 
 more towels in the room
 in room tea coffee maker
 nothing
 the studio room was quite small considering its a 5 star hotel otherwise everything was great 
 no black pudding on tuesday no air conditioning was noisy from generators outside or fans inside room212 had to have windows open because very warm wheelchair user not able to get in and out of bath would have been nice for a wet room
 nothing
 i paid for a large suite but was given a double room instead had to pay 100 more to get the suite inhad originally bookrd
 noice in room all night from some motor running on maybe ventilation system a drone all night that keep us for sleeping welll
 i booked 2 suites and their was only 1 available they gave me a 20 rebate on 1 suite but i feel they could have done more this was a very special week end for my family as we were celebrating my daughter s 30th birthday and also her engagement not a very good start to the celebrations 
 breakfast would have been better suited to a buffet style as opposed to al acarte
 the gym is right on the sun rooftop impossible to use in summer time because there is at least 50 c inside swimming pool it is actually super tiny more for kids playing 
 the facilities are not what you expect of a place like that its nothing special really besides the location the room was basic and rather simply furnished could have used another armchair or couch or else 
 it s not a 4 star hotel expensive for no reason
 no lift and no offer of compensation for trekking up 3 flights of stairs with luggage room key card then didn t work when we got to room at night even though not been kept by mobile phone breakfast staff were rude didn t acknowledge us until we asked to be sat down didn t listen to our order so brought coffee not tea cooked breakfast was cheap food that had sat for a long time and was one of worst hotel breakfasts id ever had put us off hiltons
 a bit far from the city the bicycle prices and condition the staff a bit slow on reaction and not accurate in information 
 thought rate was on the high side but did get upgraded without asking to larger room
 everything was perfect 
 check in was a complete mess i had booked two club rooms and had previously spoke to reservation for two rooms adjacent one for me and one for my daughter travelling from toronto and was allocated rooms 1269 and 1271 on the 12th floor my daughter checked in and was allocated room 1269 great i arrived an hour later and was told that the only room available was 1240 my room had been allocated to someone else i could not believe the incompetence after about 40 minutes they found two rooms together on the 11th floor so my daughter had to move all her belongings from one room to another breakfast being in a club room we had access to the club lounge went for breakfast could not get a table all occupied redirected to the main breakfast room took away the pleasure of eating in the club lounge which we paid for not impressed this hotel certainly needs a manager
 smallest room i have ever been you can choose between the heat or the noisy air conditioned 
 the elevator is small and outdated there s a small flight of steps you have to climb to reach the receptionist but no big deal
 i didn t like much the fact i had to leave 
 the bathroom was badly designed you couldn t go in after someone had taken a shower as there was no shower basin just a trendy drain away style hole in the middle the tap didn t work properly either
 personel could care more
 the room was small no shower cap in the bath 
 there was no hot water in the bathroom the shower head was broken bathroom door lock was broken 
 nothing to do with hotel but after concert you have to queue with people going onto tube to get back to hotel 
 i liked everything
 bath very small
 cleanliness in the room obstructed window hiding a dirty courtyard and being charged for a bar bill that wasn t mine 
 our room was very spacious and clean but was facing a narrow street that was noisy at night we mentioned the issue to the front desk they moved us to a different room and gave a complementary breakfast 
 rooms are small
 to small room hotel didnt look like 4 stars one bathroom was very old and little and the door from bathroom was looking all the time u need somwbody to push it from outside to open if not u get stuck in the bathroon
 having to leave 
 the room was extremely small only half a meter around the bed from each side and was nowhere near the photos from the website the mattress was very uncomfortable it felt like it was broken in the middle the pillows were also very uncomfortable the shower was broken and the bathroom was also small the breakfast was very expensive at 20euros per person 
 air conditioning was not working and the room was incredibly stuffy and very hot the maintenance chap tried to fix but it didn t work was too hot to sleep 
 n a
 the air conditioning broke down the third night and never worked properly afterwards i asked reception to check into this but it really wasn t followed up and on the last day night we had no aircon we were provided with a fan but we should have been moved to another room as a result we were given a discount for the last night and an apology unfortunately it was very hot in vienna and the room became uncomfortably hot 
 most things terrible location was meh 
 nothing
 that there was no bath in the room
 swimming pool when i try using pool water inside be very cold wrrr
 what we thought was missing is a proper ventilation for the bathroom and maybe some curtains not for the sun but for using it at night so not everyone can see what are you doing in the room the wi fi is weak but works don t expect high speed internet 
 no bath tub in a five star hotel i had never seen before the hotel is dated 
 preferred wifi in my room but was not too big an impost
 nothing
 the jacuzzi was not working on my second visit on my first the steam room was not open i came to use the spa facilities it s my bday month no special treats given due to birthday 
 wifi didn t work in the room bathroom was dated as well as room 
 no complaints at all 
 breakfast
 nothing really 
 the lack of opening windows made us a little claustrophobic 
 single room 9m2 for 4star hotel even it is center of wienna it is not for regular customers
 it was across the road from a gentleman s club so some rooms can hear the noise say they leave at 5 am 
 perhaps a little help with the bags but other than that nothing we loved it 
 we stayed in a king deluxe room which was tiny compared to the nh collection barbizon we moved from both 4 hotels furniture rather dated bathroom small but clean and well equipped the thing with carpeted rooms is that if the carpet isn t perfect it cheapens the entire room and makes it seem dirty though it might not be the carpet in this room was not great overall a 3 superior rather than a 4 the reedeming quality of the room was the view of the river and city 
 small details like a plant in the room that had seen better days and a rusty soap holder 
 additional payments for internet and the swimming pool i would have thought that these facilities would have been included
 room slightly small and dark
 we got a room at the roof very old and simple no wifi more like 3 star hotel only after we complained we were moved to a better room 
 but wifi is slow in room 
 expected a bit more like from 4 star hotel especially furniture too old and found dust on some surfaces 
 too expensive for what the hotel has to offer poor quality service and facilities that were disappointing the plugs in my room didn t work for example and the water does not get very hot only mild staff was not very effective at solving these problems location is also bad because it is only truly close to the red light district everything else worth seeing is at least 15 mins walk away and the public transfer trams don t go that close to the hotel
 pool was not clean 
 room was quite small and without view
 the first room was not clean the room was claustrophobic and very basic without even a desk chair or somewhere to put luggage half used toiletries in the bathroom noisy air conditioning poor shower poor breakfast not a pleasant stay 
 the staff at reception were poorly trained they always seemed overloaded and flustered 
 room was far too small this said it served its purpose electricity kept going off on the sockets this happened 3 times in the space of 24 hours while the staff where relatively quick in sorting this out is was an inconvenience on the second morning our stock of light snacks was not replenished 
 initial issue with room however manager rectified the situation very promptly 
 the room was very very small and besement
 nothing 
 not a lot 
 breakfast should change menu 
 staff were not helpful quite rude hotel is quite old and really needs renovation smelled old 
 room facility noise because of poor insolation poor privacy in the room no signes for people occupying the room old sanitary of the building
 the a c was not working well the shower drainage was not working slow room service
 the rooms are really small in relation to the price 
 no iron in the room no real coffee they have instant 
 a bit dirtily in the bathroom no bathrobes and slippers and no toothpaste and toothbrush 
 the description i purchased the hotel on from your site was incorrect for the room we had allocated no 37 tv on wall bose radio large bathroom or sitting area i rang booking com up to complain after speaking to hotel your company was rude and unhelpful the hotel were helpful please check your descriptions in future
 small and cramped tasteless breakfast poor wifi uncomfortable bed
 if the breakfast was included with the same rate it would be fantastic 
 we stay at this hotel 3 to 4 time a year and this time our room was the smaller and not basket of fruits my friend had a very big room and the fruits i do not understand
 small room caterogy feels like hostel and thus definetly overpriced 
 the hotel was a lot further away from the main town than it said and the food selection in the restaurant wasn t great 
 early evening service in the brasserie was dismal and chaotic service in the millenium bar after 11pm show finish almost non existent 
 rooms are small
 just because i m a naturally hot person i found the room and hotel too hot but that s just me my husband thought it was cosy ha
 bad service
 unfortunately no breakfast facility but that was known at the point of booking 
 nothing we were pleased with everything
 rooms are quite small no privacy in bathroom and toilet area so you better hope you re sharing with someone close also i ve had a bad experiences with them deducting money from my account the cost of two nights plus 50 was held at check in which is standard procedure and fine with me however on check out i paid in full and still 6 days later they haven t released 500 that was held so currently my value weekend away currently cost me over 1000 i ve emailed twice with no reply and had to call to chase i should get my money back however i feel it s important to ensure anyone staying here takes this into consideration i had the available funds but if you don t you might get caught out 
 construction of rooms next door short bed and uncomfortable pillows
 room is a little small the painting on the wall is scaring better to remove it water in the room charges money and there is no clear notice for it
 nothing
 nothing
 the bar closed very early and there was nowhere to get s hot drink or alcoholic drink after 11 30
 poor soundproofing from the hallway the doors kept slamming shut floor plan of the room was not good and the bathroom was quite small 
 the size area of the room was actually too much small my wife and myself were hardly can move in this room this was the biggest problem we faced in this hotel 
 very satisfied guests 
 no room service for late evening evening snacks in bar poor and not varied rooms need a bit of upgrade and some toiletries would be appreciated in the rooms and not just basic soap 
 sky bar was closed before midnight shame 
 the breakfast was adequate but is your typical european breakfast variety we tended to go have breakfast at local cafe s just because we wanted to experience the local food 
 nothing 
 signage to get to the actual hotel made difficult to find due to surrounding building work 
 location as was quite far out
 a hotel with a pool is would have been great as it was hot but this is not that type of hotel
 no air conditioning in the room it was very stuffy
 problems and noise because of reconstruction
 the room was a little bit cold but we got a heating as soon as we asked for it 
 the front desk staff was not friendly at all booked a double room the room was too small even to fit a double bed the bed was pushed to the wall no lamp table nothing to place your alarm of any kind or socket to charge your mobile basically was pushed to the cold wall and had to jump off the bed from the other side not convenient at all the airconditioning was terrible and noisy when i complained to the frontdesk he basically told me this is a machine and it is like that i had to call house keeping three times to service the room as when i returned to the room mid day it was untouched although the sign was already on the door 
 room was cosy small but i was alone
 the room was way too warm which made it difficult to sleep at night 
 only one thing that marred our stay was the fact that we were woken at 7 in the morning by water coming through our ceiling on a good note the staff were excellent and had a different room for us within 10 minutes
 the room was cold and noisey we were on the ground floor with a very noisey generator air con unit outside the window which caused two sleep less nights
 it was a bit higher priced than necessary for the season 
 no view although the booking says it has 
 staff were mostly rude and tried to rush me on check in even though there was no one in line their air conditioning is terrible it was colder in the lobby than my room which had ac on full blast for hours when i told reception about this problem they wanted to check it out themselves as if they didn t believe me then when they got to my room they felt the air vent and said yes it is working omg it was like pulling teeth getting them to change us to a room that was actually cold 
 the room was not a hilton standard service wasn t good i left a expensive jacket there which was not going very disappointed in
 wifi was a tad bit slow 
 there was nothing we didn t like 
 breakfast served cold upstairs in a conference room the room was narrow and long friends room had many things broken all fed back at the time 
 attitude of the staff members
 bathrooms were extremely dirty and unclean it seems that the house cleaning staff are not doing their job or the management is not keeping a tab on the flew knees of the rooms the first bedroom on the 5th floor where i stayed first night was extremely noisy very poor experience 
 breakfast is expensive 
 nothing at all our stay was just perfect 
 what is there not to like 
 the waiting time to get into our room was ridiculous we were told it would be ready at 2 and it wasn t ready until 5 pm but once we got into our room the view was great and the room service was good too 
 no wash clothes in bathroom
 lots of noise late at night from reception area but asked to move and other room very quiet
 the doors of other rooms were closing with slam in the mornings and always waking us up 
 room is small and cramped with toilet and bath the bath tube should be with translucent glass 
 nothing
 difficult eat breakfast in bed missing a table
 check in was bad and check out take much longer time i found some insect in the room elevator takes long time and breakfast area was crowded and not orgenized well 
 shower not very powerful it was pretty warm and window only opened a little air con kept cutting out and duvet was very heavy noisey at times probably slightly quieter if stay at back though without great views expensive bar drinks but to be expected at a 4 star hotel 
 no 24hr room service breakfast terrible everything swimming with grease no normal toast horrible saturated fried bread fatty bacon snotty eggs almost in edible and certainly not worth the money we tried to order the 24hr room service at about 2am and were told we couldn t have anything not even a sandwich i m afraid to say that this was false advertising and we booked so we could use this facility which was not available we did order room service for lunch which took an hour and a half for these reasons i wouldn t stay again 
 room was bit dusty 
 nothing
 nothing
 a long and twisting corridor to get to our room
 lack of compontance from each member of staff
 breakfast time was mayhem all the hot breakfast items were empty and guests having to wait for a while for more to be cooked etc the bar in the evening was a long queue for people just coming in for a drink to let the train queue die down guests having to wait in line not acceptable but i emailed hotel and manager is going to rectify these issues 
 my mothers only quarrell was that she couldn t live there for the rest of her days 
 could not fault anything 
 the price 
 the area around is being developed lots of construction no noise pollution thankfully in a year or so this hotel will be even more popular than it already is 
 the illumination of the room it was difficult to have enough light to read 
 just few recommendations i stayed in an executive room with a coffee machine for which special capsules were needed that could not be found in the supermarket our coffee capsules finished 4 of them and no new ones were ever left we stayed for five days i have already made a recommendation in my previous reviews to replace the machine with a simple electric cattle which can be used for making tea and coffee without special capsules often the used cups or taken away and no clean ones were left which made us use plastic cups from the fitness the same cups are to be used for both tea and coffee they are ok for coffee but way too small for tea it would be good to have at breakfast and in the rooms two types of cups mugs for tea and smaller cups for coffee it would be nice to have more and newer machines in the fitness 
 no breakfast included even though i upgraded my room on check in
 no possibility to open the room window 
 the sausages v poor had to have a few drinks to get rid of taste
 the bed and bedding was too ferm for my liking
 the credit card was double charged for accommodation because of this i have problems unfortunately the hotel administration did not make any attempts to help they also did not recognize the fact of double payment also no help from the hilton group the only one who really helped was the representative of the service booking com the hotel as a whole is good but i will never go there again 
 too small
 while the rooftop area was amazing there were a few occasions that it was occupied by private functions which made it slightly less accessible as hotel customers we were still able to use the area during these times but it was very busy and noisy 
 while our room was away from the street it only had one small window looking out a roof area with ac units which made the room dark 
 the a c was off and therefore the air in the room was stale dry and too warm the management told us the a c would be off during the winter months so we would have to open the window if we wanted fresh air the problem with that is the noisy neighborhood partying through the night also during weekdays mixed with the loud garbage collectors and traffic noise making it impossible to sleep with the window open 
 n a
 the bedroom looked wonderful but lacked storaage space 
 it would have been nice to have been informed of all the building works that were taking place prior to our stay there were builders and dirt everywhere
 bathroom small
 even though the rooms are labeled superior they are quite tiny relaying on label i didn t check how many square meters fall into this category and was surprised when we arrived please do check that to know what to expect 
 no full length mirror in my room which was annoying room 216 and on 2nd night very noisy drunk next door guests not the hotels fault and the staff were very apologetic and acted quickly and moved me to another room upgrade so problem sorted
 room was quite small
 you get what you pay for 300 for a one night is quite expensive but the hotel did deliver 
 we were in room 301 which was the disabled room but there was a really bad smell from the bathroom i think when you book through your website i have noticed that hotels give you the disabled room 
 the room is a bit smaller relative to the bathroom but nothing i can really complain about 
 room was a little small room service was inconsistent over our 3 nights stay we were given different number of complimentary water bottles and nespresso capsules every day on some days none 
 new russian receptionist please advise her to smile to clients breakfasts are really really modest why 
 nothing it was brilliant 
 the tv remote control was dodgy although this is often the case in hotels 
 the pillows would just not up a 4 star property it was like staying at 1 star property the staff on departure were not very helpful when contracting later in the day the hotel management did not take my point of view seriously smoke alarm when off in another room at 05 13 for at least 20 seconds
 room was comfortable but very small even by london standards 
 our room was newly refurbed and there were teething issues this wasn t dealt with as well as it might have been 
 had to check in before you could park the car 
 nothing everything was awesome
 nothing
 breakfast not included in the price and they charge it 25 euro person moreover receptionists are rude and don t speak english language well 
 heat control it was far too hot in my room maintenance were apparently on their way to fix it on the day i left no plug close to the mirror hairdryer was wired in so hard to use my straighteners 
 old tv set air conditioning controls not very good 
 i was expecting a nice evening bar which was not available some staff attitude put me a bit down in terms of service breakfast waitress 
 breakfast quantity a bit poor
 tapas very bland avoid staff cold 
 need some refresh in style
 twin room not ready dining room like a canteen and ver noisy very small room 
 at reception staff did not have a map of london the bed was too small for 2 
 i was very annoyed with the check in they wanted to move me to another partner hotel in paddington due to problem with heating they rang earlier in the day suggesting this i completely refused and was eventually given a room in this hotel but i dislike the way this was done and it was almost a favour to give me the room i had booked 
 small and dull rooms poor breakfast and dinner they made me pay 30 euros per night for my 3 year old
 as a base for a short break no negative comments 
 air conditioning broke down on the last night 
 housekeeping a bit late cleaning room and did not replace the coffee pods or shower gel 
 gym only had 3 pieces of equipment and no free weights 
 nothing 
 the dirty walls and my room was not cleaned and the front desk could do nothing but offer clean towels 
 the rooms are as almost always in paris quite small but the space is used optimally i prefer shutters to curtains but that is a very personal preference 
 building works everywhere around the hotel 
 rooms were very small but as only staying one night wasn t a major issue 
 furniture kinda old felt like it stinks also the bathroom outdated and didn t shine nothing 
 bathroom doors didn t lock
 our room had a very peculiar smell that came from the shower drain i am sure this could be remedied by the hotel and should be since we did leave our windows open to try and get rid of the smell elevator very slow and busy glad we were on the first floor and only used the elevator when we had our suitcases
 the bar prices were very expensive our room was stuck in a corner on the 7 th floor with a view of a brick wall and rooftop junk yard disappointing when you consider the views the other rooms had 
 gym facilities were average and staff interaction wasn t exceptional
 no heating
 poor wifi signal
 room was narrow no in room coffee facilities no bathroom robes
 all good
 front doors are not designed for luggage movement 
 air conditioning not responsive whole hotel too warm for our comfort 
 expensive for what is on offer small rooms with limited facilities
 all those stairs we had to negotiate to our room club room 36 
 there is no breakfast included but can be bought in the cafe next door the wording in the information about the hotel could definitely be better than sounding as if it is included would still have booked it the room was extremely hot when i arrived in the evening however woke up at 3 am freezing cold as the radiators were switched off and didn t come on until 7 in the morning it was not possible to operate them from the room blankets could definitely have been provided in the rooms 
 no fried eggs
 would have preferred shower gels to soaps
 there were trash in front of the entrance upon the arrival there were 3 young man passing time at the entrance area making comments which was worrying because not knowing if they are harmless of not i had booked a twin bed room but didn t get once the beds were separated one bed was only 80 cm wide which was not enough the bathroom glass door was great looking but does not give any intimacy 
 size of single room it was a little bit too small especially the bathroom 
 1 safe in room wasn t working 2 very poor slow service in the legends bar at one point there were people waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be served and there was only one barman present around midnight also as reported to hotel management there were some very dodgy practices going on especially by one bar man i have the name and time of this on receipt that is adding 10 service charge automatically and then not explaining why it was being added nor giving the opportunity for it to be removed even though it should be discretionary further he rounded up the bill so he said that s 8 50 gave change of 1 50 when the bill said 8 25 in other words a nice little earner for him if he did that each time throughout the night 
 the service in the roof top bar could have been better some of the staff came across a little standoffish really the only thing which let the hotel and the bar down 
 price is too expensive
 not friendly stuff no hot water complicated directions how to open the door robinet etc 
 hairdryer was a joke for a 4star hotel the bathroom facilities were not good at all we went out new years day and no one had made up the room someone knocked our door at 7pm and asked did we want it made up what did the hotel want us to do take a walk 
 the rooms feel like either prison cells the stone wall version or the inside of a coffin the wooden version we tried both seems they have gone for some version of minimalist art however leaves the rooms feeling cold 
 london is expensive also the lighting in the room was inconvenient i felt like in an er oh and the noise in fact i had to sleep with ear plugs 
 the price was a bit expensive but it s fine
 the room was small and rather shabby and the pillows were surprisingly lumpy a pity as usually this hotel offers a very good standard 
 better bathroom products no lift available so that was a struggle
 had a view of the back yard and bins was expecting a view of canary wharf food was pricey and not worth the money
 nothing
 cleaning staff noise too early in morning seemed exceptionally noisy over other like hotel properties 
 my only gripe is that the food offering was a little poor not really into microwave meals from a fridge breakfast is superb though
 milk cartons in fridge were six months out of date missing cutlery though we didn t need them i only mention so the hotel can restock i also mentioned at reception upon check out side lamp needed fixing mentioned all this upon check out and hotel were apologetic and more importantly vowed to fix can t ask for more than that 
 no booking found when we arrived hotel said you never sent across wait half and hour for kettle to be delivered hotel put card through door saying sorry happy birthday enjoy cake and champagne but they never arrived for over an hour
 room had very little natural light bed too hard disturbance during night by next bedroom occupants rowing and swearing
 breakfast on monday morning was packed to overflowing items running out queue to get in 
 none
 view 
 i m not sure if this hotel deserves 4stars the name of the hotel was different on the building than on booking com i booked 2 days before arriving it was confusing and made it hard to find the mattress with springs was incredibly bad not comfy at all as the matter of fact it was painful to lay on it i could hardly sleep a few hours and one of the springs were even higher than the rest a 4star hotels should never provide a mattress like this the breakfast was poor i expected much better the place for the breakfast is small maybe that is why the choice was limited i didn t like this hotel i m not coming back 
 nothing
 on our last night a letter from reception was pushed under our door asking us to make good the arrears on our account there were none we had prepaid i phoned reception and they said i had taken breakfast which i hadn t they accepted this and said they would sort it out next day on checking out i found that the imaginary breakfast was still there on our account when we had checked in the receptionist asked if i wished to leave a credit card to cover extras which i declined to do good job or else the breakfast would have been charged to my account and i may not have noticed i did complain to the front of house manager who apologised and has since emailed with a further apology and explanation of what happened all fine but i would expect such a large organisation to compensate rather than simply apologise in these cases this was our third stay at the doubletree tower bridge and the first time we have had any cause to complain so i wouldn t want to put anyone else off but make sure you double check your bill 
 the room was very small and because of the location was very hard to sleep because of the noise
 the walls are very thin and you can hear the neighbors the lift
 value for money
 nothing
 executive room was tired and small not worth extra money bar food was poor quality breakfast no communication from staff hard to find hotel
 time to get your room and there process takes so long
 nothing 
 no early check in unless pay and extra 30 euros 
 nada
 breakfast was very basic no sausages bacon was very salty pre packed croissants not fresh no choice for how to have eggs cooked
 nothing perfect
 had to wait in a queue for breakfast one morning in the bar they had no dry white wine apart from chardonny
 check in time was a little late for my preference wasn t able to check in until almost 5pm
 room size a bit small check in very slow safe was locked not enough tea and coffee
 the single rooms can be very small but for one night who cared the only thing i don t like is that in some of the single rooms you have to get out of the bed to turn off the bedside light 
 i have been to this hotel before because location is perfect for me but there are few things i dont like cleaning was better than last time but stil there was horrible smell inside the shower there was missing reading light by the armchair too dark and nobody told me there is a fitnes n relax lounge on the 8th floor which is really shame cos i have been here a few times before and could have use it before 
 the bathroom drain was always blocked
 the breakfast arrangement being seated in a large hall
 seriously wimpy shower and two beds not a double neither a major issue 
 vegetarian vegan provision at breakfast seemed limited and staff weren t clear what milk they were offering it wasn t labelled restaurant was pretty packed at breakfast rooms are on the small size views from rooms are interesting 
 tv signal wasn t great
 there were 3 of us in the room but only 2 cups robes slippers towels breakfast was expensive
 house keeper does not leave enough tissues in the bathroom
 not a single complaint 
 nothing i didn t like really all in all it is a nice hotel in a really good location if you want to get out an explore the city 
 the room would have been perfect if there was a holder for the hand soap and some hooks to hang towels 
 rooms size bathroom too small
 room had paint missing and marks on wall
 don t know his name but there was one employee at the concierge desk who was very rude and had a really bad attitude rest of the staff were nice 
 they upgraded the room and still it was small size 
 being woken at 7 a m by delivery vans men ouch 
 hotel bar is recommended best cocktail menu in the world however we did not like the somewhat exotic mixture of drinks too little drink for money 
 standard double room was very small 
 room slightly too warm despite climate control on minimum only stayed 2 nights but no real complaints
 nothing 
 lots of banging of doors each morning
 no restaurant although they do serve breakfast and meals can be provided as room service 
 i had a really small room i booked a single but asked if they could put me in a modernised room i had been before to view the hotel bathroom needs modernising 
 would like a quiet lounge sitting area away from the area at the bar but a very small point 
 tiny room 
 i am triple sure i checked the breakfast included on the booking com search this is the reason i selected the hotel breakfast was not included they charged 17 euro extra per person per day lol at that money i would select another hotel 
 small rooms small toilets small bar had to wait for table for breakfast and eventually had to ask for refund ordered 4 meals late on 10 30pm on the evening and had only enough for 1 so had to order takeaway pizza instead staff still extremely helpful though with finding somewhere for us to order from 
 the hotel is currently undergoing renovation having said that we paid for breakfast and although we knew at the time of booking that it was a continental breakfast we didn t mind what we had was a stale croissant the tiniest muffin i have ever seen a hard boiled egg that wasn t freshly prepared an apple and a carton of orange juice how best weston had the nerve to charge for this i ll never know i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i most certainly won t be staying there again
 hotel undergoing major building work lots of noisy drilling in afternoon room was ok but rather tired 
 the roof terrace
 somewhere to put our bags
 nothing
 all ok
 one thing is the limited parking at the hotel
 housekeeping service was bad there is no parking for cars in the hotel no body assisted in cayying luggage to room neighborhood was full of homeless 
 there wasn t anything to not like
 a bit outdated interior 
 noise at night do you need to dispose of empty bottles late at night 
 slow wifi
 the scrum you have to engage in at breakfast with a lot of ignorant and bad mannered foreigners also the staff were very noisy shouting in an e european language in the early morning banging around the room next to us as they cleaned and made beds i had to reprimand them as we wanted top sleep beyond 08 00 
 this is an old hotel that has only been minimally updated the bathtub didn t drain properly the rug was worn the decor was tired worst of all the room was noisy one night a combination of construction and music from a club went on until 2am hard to sleep 
 very very crowded and the room walls are dirty 
 taxi service from hotel we have never felt so pressurised to use someone s service with whom we never made any contract or agreement not even verbally as i did not place the phone call to the taxi company the receptionist did after asking for taxi at the reception i immediately requested to cancel it as it would take more time to get there than the uber and we had to rush to the airport the taxi ordered showed up at the same time as our uber driver i was verbally attacked by the taxi driver who shouted who did you order first the uber or taxi he was unfortunately happily backed up by manager or supervisor of the hotel who decided to get her claws out saying it was illegal and that i made her ring a cab and so was required to use his service for christ s sake please check eu consumer law and have a good read about the right of cancellation you should be ashamed of this havoc you created in your street you blocked your busy road for a good five minutes you shouted at a customer who spent 800 for 3 nights at your hotel and most importantly who had no time to waste being a victim of this appalling scene when in a hurry to get to the airport you are only accommodating when it is for your own interest that pathetic behaviour only appeared to us as utter disrespect to my partner myself and the uber driver on our last day i do not recommend using the desk service as despite amsterdam being very liberal you may feel deprived of your basic customer rights
 service at breakfast was pretty poor ordered a tea didn t receive after asking numerous times also had to send our breakfast back one day due to it being cold this put us off dining in the hotel in the evening tv signal was also a bit interment kept freezing 
 the room decor and fittings were old and tired travelodge have comfier beds the bar service was appalling having to wait 30 minutes to get a drink this is not a 4 star establishment
 i called the hotel to ask if i can pay the last night of our family stay by maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible when we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information 
 hotel did not have the booking com booking in its computer system waited long time at reception given a small corner replacement room with noisy internal unit behind locked door air con or generator or something no discount or free breakfast offered out of courtesy room temperature very difficult to control peak checkout time next day 8 30am 9 00am had only one person at the desk two at most for brief periods very long wait just to leave 
 the bar prices were a little expensive
 jammed window just a crack open was closed enough to prevent the shower steam from getting out yet open enough to let the freezing night air in along with the noise from outside said window moldy from trapped steam and pure neglect bed too small for 2 persons why on earth are the hallway doors closed at night this is a potential safety issue escape routes always need to be clear and open escape route doors open inwards now how is a person in a wheelchair supposed to manage these especially in an emergency situation stay was booked on business terms but the space provided for laptop documents etc was not large enough and cramped between tv and bed this was my second stay and the above describes the room i had towards the rear of the building 1st stay in may 2013 was in a room towards the front a business suite which was better 
 we had booked for a one night stay to attend a concert in the area and the receptionist that checked us in rather than say that the booking had come through with my surname as my christian name and that i was male he proceeded to imply that i was not the person who had made the booking despite the fact that they had all my details just round the wrong way this attitude was unsettling and angered my partner who tried to contact the hotel group that novotel belong to only to be told that because the booking was done through booking com there wasn t anything they could do which was surprising and indicates that their system for receiving bookings from other agents needs reviewing and their staff trained better to deal with potential errors to make matters worse when we had lunch in the bar and tried to put this on our room bill we were told that the same receptionist had not authorised my card for this facility and had only taken payment for the room authorising cards on check in is standard practice in my experience therefore i m not sure why this was not done as it meant all additional purchases had to be paid for separately although this situation was not resolved we were at least offered two free drinks by way of an apology after making a complaint the contemporary decor seems to disappear in the rooms the bath was actually just a shower as it had no actual taps and was small the water ran hot and cold intermittently for some reason having upgraded to a superior room the sofa bed was made up as two single beds and when we tried to restore it back to a sofa we were only able to retract half of the sofa the aircon was poor to almost non existent however the weather had been exceptionally hot but would have expected the aircon to be able to cope 
 nothing
 there is limited entertainment in the immediate area 
 toilet wouldn t flush away solids this also happened last time i was there 
 not a lot of facilities room over priced for what was offered
 single rooms could ve been a bit cheaper
 awful room with no window and a deafening extractor fan that could not be turned down or off and staff that apparently couldn t care less about it despite saying its a common complaint 
 room a little small
 concierge adjusting water for shower was adventure
 really small bathroom 
 the window lock was a little flimsy and there was some chipped paint on the windowsill but other than that nothing 
 room was very hot air con on button didn t work later found a separate isolation switch above bathroom door which was on the off position would recommend this be left in the on position 
 parking underground too expensive and no left we have to take stairs and it was difficult with kids the hotel entrance from the street is not good we can t stop near the entrance because it is a main street with no side parking or even waiting area 
 1 the heater takes about 10 mins before the water warms up after e shower is being turned off needs another 10 mins to warm up still 2 wifi very slow can t access when i am on the bed only designated areas 3 requests not being answered promptly
 quite noisy on monday morning due to trucks and boats going past rooms on the small side coffee machine in room difficult to operate shower door didn t close properly although they fixed it resulting in water all over bathroom floor 
 when i arrived there was a cot in my room rather than a chair or chesterfield but the staff replaced it within 48 hours 
 i didn t find anything about this hotel that i didn t like it s even got electronic do not disturbed a door bell and a bell for maid service 
 room colours was very dark the food wasn t good 
 service at evening meal not as good as good as should have been my streak was over cooked
 we got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening the bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed the power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices i think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience
 the bed was like a rock shower and bathroom was leaking carpet in rooms and hallways needs to be updated 
 the room was incredibly noisy it seemed like there was some kind of plant room right next door so the wall against which the bed was placed was literally humming all night long it was like sleeping in an engine room when we told the reception staff about this upon check out we were basically told that it was our fault for not reporting it and asking to be moved get real it was after midnight when we got to our room did they really think that two very tired travellers would be ready to jump out of bed get dressed and race around the hotel to look for another room 
 only one small bottle of water per room had to pay for extra water
 nothing
 there were no coffee maker or electric kettle in the room 
 all the other things could have been better the most remarkable things was that the hotel staff is absolutely incompetent and made my check out a nightmare i would highly appreciate if immediate actions would be taken against the reception staff that worked on the 03 10 16 and a woman named helena most of all 
 furniture slightly old 
 i asked a view for the street but it wasnt possible 
 the room was very very small we did upgrade but still very small and the hotel too expensive comare to the room 
 bad lightening small rooms blood and lipstick stain on the bed safe not working cupboard doors not closing toilet make skweaking noise when sat on
 bed covers were dusty
 there was reconstruction going on the hotel apparently changed the owner and definitely the quality went down 
 too much noise due to our room overlooking the street 
 bigger tv in the room the tv was fine but a little on the small side when watching tv in bed yeah i know first world problems 
 drinks prices although this is to be expected given its location and standing 
 the bathroom smelt due to the shower which smelled like an open drain when reported to reception they weren t interested 
 nil
 the room for the price when i went through booking com i looked at the pictures under the room i was booking the room i got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality i m lucky i complained and they gave me an upgrade 150 pounds for this i wouldn t have paid 75 for it 
 the price paid due to size of the room was not fair there was sockets that didn t work and the mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door did not open as it hit a wall so was pointless room was very small 
 n a
 pillows
 the bar closed way too early 
 wifi was very poor
 unpleasant smell in room noisy guests in room next door 
 overall i had a terrible experience here as i had my purse stolen from the hotel reception while collecting my luggage there is no security whatsoever everyone can come in and out of the reception from the street and while the location is convenient close to the train station it is also one of the rougher areas of paris so some form of security is a must some ideas have someone supervising the door at the very least and a door that stays closed unless someone buzzes you in 
 small room
 mini bar was poor selection 
 breakfast service needs more staff and attention to timing of bringing meals together
 small room
 breakfast was just ok small buffet and boiled scrambled or fried eggs not poached plus no bacon sausage etc 
 would recommend booking sagrada familia and gaudi and other major venues pre journey as the tours where not available until 5 hours later you can book on line 
 nothing 
 tv reception not great
 the view another building we know you cannot do much about that 
 the hairdryer was not working and they had no replacement so that was a little disappointing but at least i tested it the night before and not after i had washed my hair the next morning i would not have been please to leave in the morning with wet hair 
 nothing it was perfect for my needs 
 nothing 
 breakfast could have started a little earlier either 630 or 7 we had to miss breakfast on the last morning as we had an 750am tour and breakfast didn t start until 730 very
 our only disappointment was that our toilet blocked in the afternoon and although we reported it at 7pm when we returned just before midnight it hadn t been addressed i asked reception who said it they couldn t sort it and we would have to use the toilet on the lower ground floor we were 3rd floor overnight a solution but not what we would expect at the rate we paid for the room shame that this left a negative impression on an otherwise lovely stay 
 the wifi system did not permit more than one gadget 
 they tried to charge us for the free upgrade 
 better english tea bags 
 shower leaking and water flowed to floor
 not enough parking despite having paid for a space had to park in road and get a refund for last night then go out by 9 am to avoid parking ticket would be better if hotel made situation clearer at time of booking 
 staff very noisy making up rooms in the morning even though the check out is 11am we were woken up pretty early because of that 
 the hotel is tired and needs a refresh the bathroom was not cleaned properly 
 if i was being really reallly picky the freebie toiletries were no great shakes and did not give the finishing touch to the otherwise lovey elegant bathrooms 
 security is slightly exaggerated cannot use stairs and need card for elevator which is standard but hard to use in this hotel a bit off the main sights but not a major thing given good connection to public transport
 bathroom looked old and rustic 
 room furniture is old
 very old and unrefurbished furniture a very small hotel with poor service delivery
 nothing
 room didn t have good heating system radiator in bathroom was not working when we arrived in the evening none of the perks promised via site for genius were there if it was too late would be nice to offer them next day as matter of principle we were two and only one set of towels and bathrobe was set 
 no coffee or any complimentary items check in was delayed till 3pm 
 security 
 we were on 10th floor
 the rooms a bit small
 a five minute walk from train station surrounding a bit dark and quiet at night 
 remote from metro
 outlaw s the starred restaurant in the hotel was a disappointment the food was on point but the service was so rushed that we did not enjoy our 55 minute in and out dinner don t know what the rush was about the restaurant was not busy much better places close to the hotel 
 when i went to check out there was a fire alarm malfunction which knocked out the computers the sole girl on reception did not have the password for the system no response to her phone calls for help fortunately another staff member came in to work and helped this was 8 15 so there should have been more than one receptionist available for checking out i had to ask them to call me a taxi on their account as i was now going to be late for my meeting which i had planned to walk to when the taxi came he asked me whether i liked the hotel when i told him of my experience he told me that this happened frequently there and he often picked up unhappy guests who had requested a transfer plus my shower was lukewarm there was no loo brush in the bathroom and the coffee was lukewarm too a very poor experience very disappointing 
 no fridge in the rooms 
 no lift to 5th floor construction work next door woke us up every morning stairs next to room very loud again woke us up at times curtains let a lot of light through room showing signs of wear and tear they didn t change bed sheets for us only tidied room toilet wasnt great at flushing tv was very awkward to turn on
 the room was small and hot i didn t sleep at all that night i was disappointed with the cocktails we paid 11 and it came in a small cocktail glass wasn t worth the money the offer on booking com was reasonable but should have come with continental breakfast 
 nothing it was a great return stay 
 not much of anything to complain about 
 dated
 parking issues road works contacted hotel to ensure parking was available to be informed on arrival we couldn t park there road work at hotel meant there was no where to stop to drop off luggage had to move 4 x large cases 200m along the road from a private car park shower cubicle small with leaking shower head that sprayed water everywhere 
 long walk to the room initial room was noisy with wind noise building work in foyer
 nothing to dislike
 room a bit small but you can t have it all 
 i wish the had more drawers to keep stuff like beside the bed
 a bit noisy room we were staying on the 1st floor with windows facing quity busy road also cleanliness was questionnable the price was quite high for what we got 
 slow elevator service 
 room is so dusty i thought it is because the windows are opened before we arrived 
 nothing
 heating air conditioning didn t work
 very expensive like everything else in london 
 it needs a face cleaning rooms are fine but corridors and elevator are a bit old breakfast is not specially good such untasty croissants in france 
 after being told i could park my car with a roof box we arrive to be told i would have to take it not an easy feat
 nothing bad 
 the pub was extremely busy on both thursday and friday evenings which was to be expected just before christmas with works parties and drink sessions so it was a bit awkward if you wanted to eat there with any degree of comfort 
 the room was a little smaller than i m used to no makeup mirror in bathroom 
 no supermarket nearby
 shower caps in bathroom would be nice 
 room cleaning earlier in the day 
 nothing to complain about
 a booking option without breakfast and dinner at a better rate is a good idea did not have a chance to either have breakfast or dinner at the hotel cannot comment quality of breakfast or dinner as we did not try them but with all the amazing restaurants in milan an option without breakfast and dinner at a better rate could be useful 
 everything was just good 
 shuttle to lcy would be a bonus
 the building work outside bathroom could do with modernisation 
 bath room space especially for the showering should have an enclose space bath tub is not useful as the space is too tight 
 we mentioned upon departure that there was a loud noise of running water in the ceiling space which did keep us awake the hotel were going to look into this with their maintenance staff 
 unfortunately too hot in the room and not able to turn down the air conditioning had a sleepless night due to having to open the window so not very restful at all have sent a complaint but not sure if this has been actioned as the page seemed to be directed to the us 
 no safe in the room poor breadselection quality of croissants
 our sheets and towels had fluff all over them and the wifi kept cutting out
 reception staff came across rude and uninterested breakfast price was over the top as well as any extras or the use of the spa 
 my first tight small room was in the first floor too many noisy doors in the corridors the next morning i brought this up with the reception so they moved me to a room in 2nd floor which was perfect
 the only issue was that the air conditioning doesn t work in winter so we had to keep the window open
 a bit faded but went with the character
 other guests waking us up at night being sick in the corridor probably an isolated incident 
 our room was a little tired and slightly on the shabby side breakfast was very busy had a terrible meal in 23 restaurant 
 no comments
 our room was a cosy double small would be a better description the cooked breakfast could have done being a bit hotter 
 we was expecting a bigger room 
 building site on the door step started at 8am couldn t have a lie in 0 
 internet wifi 
 the security staff were over zealous at the end of the evening basic attitude of we have had your money now get out not good wasn t helped by booking com not sending the booking through to the hotel at least that s what we was told this resulted in a 30 minute wait at reception to get it sorted 
 no parking
 no fruit was available to take away at breakfast as i only have coffee it would have been nice to take away a piece of fruit for later in morning seeing as i paid for it the bathroom tiles were a little stained and the plug did not fit in bath so water would not stay in could not sleep as very noisy and we were on 10th floor so did not expect so much noise 
 
 you had to queue for breakfast as l don t think they had catered or were prepared for the guests that did not have breakfast included 
 it felt like the hotel was originally designed with a lot of effort but taken over and run with lower quality small details the internet was really slow for extra money you could get real internet as the included one is ok for webmail as indicated by the rules the mirror in the bath was lose the bathrooms toilets in the common area restaurant were left not cleaned stinky and the door to some rooms could not be closed the breakfast was the worst we have seen since long the personnel could not tell us if shops would be open on sunday the personnel was not capable of telling us where to find nice areas in milano
 room was appallingly small room 301 it was nothing more than a cupboard with very steep steps leading into it which were dangerous the tv ariel didn t work 
 nothing
 some of the staff were a bit unfriendly although some were nice 
 was a wee bit far out from main attractions drink prices were quite high 
 unfortunately the internet was very very bad in the rooms while i needed the internet those two days i was very dissapointed the pictures on the onternet showed a more spacious rolm than what we got our room was extremely small all in all it was just a plain ok nothing more nothing less 
 room was tiny and too hot
 better climate control in room more ventilation would make it perfect 
 we didn t have any issues
 the pool area was not pleasant the hotel is located at a rather deserted area far from the city centre not convenient for public transport
 very small bathroom 
 room size
 i assumed breakfast was included apparently it wasn t the hotel bar prices are extortionate 30 for 2 drinks is ridiculous 
 fitness center 
 restaurant staff very unprofessional upon finishing our 3 course set menu meal we requested the bill when we checked the bill it was incorrect we pointed out this mistake it was corrected when we received the second bill we again noticied another minor mistake on the charge for our deserts i e an additional 10p as a matter of principle we brought this to the attention of the same waitress who started arguing with us about the choice of desert we had ordered and size she had not taken our desert order and we advised her she was incorrect as we had ordered the desert off the set menu to avoid further annoyance and stress we settled the bill it was very dissapointing to be treated this way especially as we were staying in the hotel and spending lots of money there during our stay 
 probability the construction but again it did not hinder our stay 
 had to go home
 see above 
 the shower is only a handheld not a huge deal but adding a hook would be a simple fix there s a nespresso like coffee machine but they do charge 2 euro per pod again due to the value of the room not a problem 
 thought the garden park area could be tidied up 
 poor wi fi connection
 no complaints at all 
 nothing it was great
 the room was rather small for family of 4 children aged 11 14 we had to ask for extra towels as they had only given for 3 including the wash products we also had to ask for the complimentary robes as they too were not in the room breakfast on the second morning was disappointing i don t think they were prepared for the volume of people they placed us in the overflow part which was the restaurant nice enough however there were no cutlery mugs and although not too far from the breakfast serving area it was far enough when you had to make several journeys because when you did go there was was no bread beans and a large que for the coffee machine the swimming pool was lovely not big but nice enough however there was no hairdryers in the ladies changing room which meant we had to go back to our rooms to dry our hair which was a bit inconvenient when you had brought everything else with you to go straight for lunch the lady on reception did offer to get one from house keeping which was lovely but there was no where in the changing room to plug it in a bit bizarre finally i think the fire alarm went off at 04 25 we didn t need to leave the room after we had all got up and dressed but this we only found out by ringing reception no apologies 
 nothing
 the rooms were very small
 breakfast or lack of
 mattress was commercially acceptable but not great everything was just fine not the top standard better luggage handling would have been welcome 
 the beds were really close together 
 breakfast outside should be available from 8 00am
 only one restaurant entrance
 the sofa bed was hard and uncomfortable in the studio room i felt the breakfast should have been included in the price as it was quite a lot of money to pay 
 cleanliness
 i the staff arent friendly and they dont even have a concierge
 the room was too little for 2
 quite a small room but perfectly fine for a base 
 staff entering my room in the morning when i m asleep do they not know when you have checked out the constant noise outside my room by the cleaners in the morning didn t help they really need be be more considerate to hotel guests in my opinion not everyone checks out at 8am 
 decor
 bar prices are on the expensive side but to be expected 
 be careful 20 for breakfast for 1 person total exaduration
 no bell service to help bring in luggage off the street 
 the room and shower were tiny and almost no space which is not how the photos show it very disappointing for the price paid 
 we were not informed by booking com that the hotel was currently in renovation resulting is everywhere being overcrowded with extra furniture etc also could here the workmen working most of the time 
 only downside was the waiter at breakfast forgot to give me my tea as it was so busy 
 price room relation is too high the room is small no hotel parking suck security check at entrance 
 cost of breakfast is a little on the expensive side but very good nonetheless the hotel tried charging us for 3 days worth of breakfast initially but we only had one breakfast there 
 elevators did not work properly our bathroom was so interesting the curtains were so thin that you could see the other rooms and can be seen by them i got my shower the lights off i have reported that to the reception but no one was interested also be careful with your payments although my deal with booking com was not to be charged from the credit card i declared they did they apologized and paid it back but still i have lost some money because of the currency change they shouldn t have done that at the first place 
 the price per night is just incredible in comparison with the small size of the room the limited internet connexion and the poor view of most rooms 
 size of the room for a deluxe very small
 pre ordered early breakfast but obviously lack of communication as staff in morning didn t seem to know staff member made me feel awkward and uncomfortable when asked for tea and toast
 nothing
 too much money for a hotel like this but then again ask any amsterdamer they would say well this is normal otherwise don t come to amsterdam go to berlin or paris if you are not happy with the prices this is not customer friendly at all but in amsterdam you pay three times the price of a paris hotel plus you always pay the city tax bloody rip off i hope they really consider it one day which i am skeptical they never will knowing their mentality 
 was very cold inside and a strange smell 
 the bed was ok but not overly comfortable we weren t crazy about the shower as the design made water go into the rest of the bathroom the location is pretty good but you re right by all the embassies so it s a little more business like in the area 
 the food we didn t try it in the end as saw lots of plates on tables with leftover food on
 room wasn t ready on arrival at 5pm had to wait until 6 no offer of refreshment reception staff unhelpful restaurant closed for function alternative room very poor the staff were frustrated and were heavily carried by their supervisors building work everywhere including fire doors propped open this well situated hotel under hilton needs to improve considerably 
 some one enter in the room in morning in two times asking me a glass i took from bar just knock and open didn t care about waking up or if dressed or no same an other day to check mini bar so inconfortable report it and funny thing they try to protect him by thinking i m lying really did not appreciate it
 first room offered was far too small changed after we complained cigarette burns on bedding sheet 
 although we were not in it much the room was small and felt cramped larger rooms available in cheaper hotel chains 
 the room was tiny and very dark with poor lighting the shower was tiny i am short and i am normal weight and i kept bumping myself against the shower door which did not stay well closed the shower was a tiny box the radiator in the bathroom got so hot you could burn yourself on it there was no space to put anything in the bathroom the bed was a single bed but i guess that is standard for europe when booking a single room 
 free parking when staying at the hotel 
 having to wait to be seated for breakfast range of fresh fruit was poor staff weren t very attentive in terms of filling up coffee croissants pastries and bread weren t fresh and were chewy
 very bad value for money is like a 3 stars 
 rooms could be bigger
 room was tiny
 pillows were so hard didn t have comfortable night 
 no robe in room
 nothing
 the hotel is very nice an welcoming but the area is not very welcoming
 there were a number of mechanical problems in the room the good news is that each was fixed as soon as reported the manager was interested to hear details and had the attitude that she would act to improve inspections 
 the room and the attitude
 difficult parking in front of the hotel when checking in out otherwise garage o k 
 tv in room spanish channels only for child no kettle only microwave shower made a horrendous noise when hot toilet drainage smell was disgusting in room no view road derelict building next door eye sore no local nice restaurants nearby only fast food chains in shopping centre outdoor pool not heated for children food poor in hotel and expensive drinks expensive in hotel expect to use public transport to access all tourist hotspots from this hotel nothing close by nothing in walking distance no beach just pebble port nearby advertise beach 5 mins away you can t use airport taxi 36 to hotel this hotel is more for business stop overs nothing more
 very hard to say but if i have to squeeze my meanings i would say that our pet did not have a choice on the cushions 
 i can t really think of anything that was missing except perhaps slippers 
 the lack of a pool maybe not much more i can say 
 should be able to walk into hotel bars without getting the grumpy have you booked discussion 
 it was a bit on the expensive side but as a special occasion was worth it 
 i was told brexfast was on offer at 12 50 when i ordered it it was full price 18 50 each apparently i had to pre book the night before this was not made clear when i mentioned it i was told there s nothing they can do my first time in london i ask of possible heigh floor room with front veiw i ended up 3rd floor looking at the back 
 a bit noisy because the train station nearby 
 housekeeping poor still waiting to hear from hotel about items stolen from the room 
 no lift
 top floor rooms are tiny so if you want space dont request the top floor honestly great location tube station 2mins walk away breakfast terrible
 the rooms and bathroom were very small as was the dining and buffet area the noise of people walking above our room was unbearable as was the noise of the tubes running beneath us the pillows were lumpy and the bath mats were a little threadbare and our air conditioner made a terrible noise but thank goodness it was chilly at the time so we hardly needed to use it 
 to get a really light room you have to book a canal view room the interior ones can be a little dark but the decor makes up for this and we were really only there when it was dark anyway 
 no negatives really perhaps a mirror behind the dressing table would be good for whilst doing your hair and had to make sure back for last boat at 11 50pm apart from that cant wait for my next visit 
 had to pay for wi fi
 we were told our room wouldn t be ready until 3 upon arrival despite checkout being at 12 we waited around however and a room became available at 1 30
 very old interiors especially doors cleaning staff is trying to enter your room from 8 00 without knocking happened twice in 2 nights no bar poor breakfast 
 no free car parking rooms are small 
 nothing much really a few more days in vienna and the k k palais would have been nice 
 very thin walls till midnight constant loud noise from other rooms breakfast does not worth at all and located in the basement you cannot really drink coffe and smoke ourside tv has nearle nothing just checked briefly had only 6 channels in bad quality big areas in the building but small rooms staff not really kind ig you arrive late or leave early 
 the rooms are very compact 
 not all rooms are like shown in the pictures specify once you book the room that you would like beds and pillows not very comfy 
 nothing really perhaps more flowers outside in the garden other than that perfect
 facilities soap shampoo etc was considered for 1 person only however this room was for 2 persons
 small rooms for this price
 nothing in particular
 being expected to pay 15 pounds a day for wifi in a 4 star hotel 
 very small rooms breakfast was not great couldn t t even get an egg 
 i m happy to tip but bell staff push for tips a bit unwarranted concierge only reccomended places that they got kickbacks from resturants w 150 200 seats dreadful or bus tours only no doing it on your own god forbid you rent a car we stayed there 3 times over 3 weeks quite nice on the 3rd trip we needed a power converter the concierge said they didn t provide them i indicated that that was odd as the last two times they were in our room when we arrived 20 seconds later he found one under the front desk odd 
 there were all sorts of problems with this room the water took at least 15 minutes to get warm every morning the tv iron were broken on arriving and the staff were all quick to respond but slow to resolve any issues the room itself is basic and quite small i d only stay here again if i had no other options 
 small rooms small beds no aircon carpeted floors very expensive compare to other hotels
 if had to say anything just that our wifi didn t work in the breakfast room but not a big deal otherwise liked everything about this hotel
 the room was quite small they did not provide duvets to sleep with the beds were quite comfy 
 what is there not to like except perhaps having a spa would be a nice option to have 
 the pre authorisation was 3 times more than the cost of the room and i haven t received my money back not even after 4 days the parking was ridiculosly expensive and very unpracticle to use it minibar was empty wi fi sucks overall my worst tourist experience never go back 
 wish the rooms are a little bigger 
 house keeping not refilled minibar with water no chance to get through roomservice at night not changed coffee cups after house keeping
 the bathroom had a glass door which was a little odd but other than that i couldn t fault it 
 very cold in the room in the shower also cold and water not very hot
 condition of the room and the parking i also think for the price people are paying breakfast should be included 
 room too small staff never at reception 
 room service started at 3pm but no one was answering the phone had to call receiption in order for someone to contact me back and take my order i had called room service for 10 minutes bloody terrible
 distance to airport and disneyland there was a metro nearby though 
 still waiting for a refund despite 3 calls
 there was no air conditioning and we happened to stay during a heatwave at least we had a fan which helped 
 the bed was a bit small
 we were in room 216 and could hear some noise from the club in the hotel however i had had a few drinks so was out like a light haha 
 nothing
 a 24 hour bar that would not serve spirits after 11p m 
 nothing i like
 have to leave
 we didn t opt for the breakfast option simply because it was 23 per person per breakfast which when you consider it is 22 for the hotels set three course evening meal makes the breakfast seem very pricey in comparison as we were hardly spoilt for choice in london we just went out for breakfast 
 not a bad experience but we found the pillows far too plump the air conditioning was a little cold and we could not turn the temperature up 
 we had problems with digital paying when we left 
 bar could have been open in the afternoon 
 room opposite lift little noisy
 the suit was too small as i saw on booking com was large 
 room smelled of cigar on the first day though the smell did disappear on subsequent days 
 not comfortable bed
 if you go for the great food of the restaurant ask the waiter always for the price without this they will serve you the best which is obviously always the highest priced wine or dish 
 matress was rather soft no complementary drinking water or kettle were provided the rear lifts had an unpleasant odour
 on site restaurant would have been ideal but lots of competition nearby albeit quite expensive 
 expensive limited restaurant menu
 nothing 
 staff was uncooperative and inexperienced their knowledge about london was poor i also ask on reception for adapter however receptionist said that i can leave self phone to her for charging next day i found out that they didn t charge it but they broke it in their opinion it wasn t their fault so they never payed repair but more importantly they never said sorry next four days i tried to speak with manager but she never showed up i even try to make appointment in couple of occasions it was broken because someone from staff tried to plug the phone too violently my phone was standard android phone and i gave them my own android charger probably they mixed up some of other incompatible charger with mine 
 no food at night
 room was small toilet smelt bad 
 tv did not perform optimally would like option of vfm continental breakfast on room service menu
 bathroom was large but lacked counter space for a lady to do makeup bit of a problem adjusting the room temperature 
 the room was very small 
 as above could do with twin beds in disabled room
 the showers were on the small size not enough seats in the bar lounge area 
 the first room deluxe double shown to us was very small the second room offered was larger although adequate and generally clean the carpet and casual chair were worn and stained this room was in the lower ground floor with a very small window looking out to a small enclosed area which made it feel claustrophobic 
 we arrived at 9am we knew and did not expect to be able to have our room however within 2 mins of walking into the hotel they wanted payment which we gave we were given a free coffee to wait in the bar as room should be ready within 1hr we appreciated this very much as we wanted to change for theatre after two hours we gave up and ha to leave to get to our show we then didn t get back to hotel until 7 sh before we left our room number was 201 when we picked up key after they could not find our left luggage we had room 470 the last room at the very top also set up for single person this spoilt a good stay 
 nothing
 the cold water in the pool brrrr 
 staff were not trained very well no manners 2 apples and a pear in the room but they was bad cleaner missed rubbish maintenance crew had better customer skills
 inability to book an extra night
 customer service really bad 
 parking disorganised powdered milk for coffee and tea in room
 location 
 no one told me how to operate the lift that is until a guest showed how the instructions in the room stated that the air conditioning controls were in easy reach of the bed it was about 6 feet away 
 the room style was comfort double room but it was sooooo tiny the air condition was not working properly not very helpful concierge
 small room poor heat no view costly for your money did upgrade and was below ground level room would not go back to this hotel
 nothing
 breakfast was worst we have had in such a long time only option of eggs was scrambled which were sloppy and under cooked bacon sausages swimming in grease and beans were stone cold on both days we stayed we had a woman sitting next to us on her own in an overcoat shoving lots of food in her pockets on both days we wondered if she had walked in off the street we were meant to have an upgrafe but this didnt happen we were very dissapointed and wont go back to hilton sorry to say 
 bed and kitchen
 old style
 the seating in the bar was very stained which was a shame as the overall look of the hotel was very modern the bar food was tasty and well priced but we thought the drinks were expensive in comparison 
 nothing
 walls and skirting boards in bedroom were filty
 the location wasn t right in the centre but it wasn t a problem to get the tram in as they were very frequent and cheap 
 the pillows 
 size of the rooms is small and i don t think management can now do anything about it 
 the only two problems was that there wasn t a bath tub and there were flies flying through the air conditioning vents and flying around the room my wife and i would love to book again on our anniversary but that s the only thing we re afraid of
 far from the center
 we booked 2 standard double rooms 1 was half the size of the other with the tiniest shower room ever the other room was much larger with a bath and room to swing a cat checked with reception to see if we had been allocated correctly and was told it was a standard because it has a queen size bed this maybe the case but you could hardly walk round the end of the bed and would have said it was more one of their cosy doubles i dread to think how small a cosy double would be very noisey from extractors and the aircon was as loud but you do get ear plugs 
 construction and noise
 the wi fi is week in the room does not work in the lobby is so slow 
 the lift did not work for the three days we were there had to carry a wheel chair up and down four flights of stairs toiletries were removed from our room 2 hours after we arrived the spare pillow was shredded and not fit for use i have a pic 
 the bathroom was a little bit old and had no bathtub for a turist that walk a lot during the day a bathtub complete the comfort at a hotel 
 room and bed were very small too small for 2 people really room bathroom and hotel common areas made a tired worn out impression everything is in need of a refit 
 some parts of breakfast were stale e g fruit bread 
 n a
 room could ve been a bit larger
 no complaints
 staff serving breakfast were a little slow and we always had to ask for cutlery i don t mind if staff chat amongst themselves but if a customer has to wait for attention that isn t enjoyable bar and reception staff were very friendly and helpfull 
 room seemed a little warm even with the air conditioning on 
 the bathrooms need attention problems with smelly drains 
 the staff is confused most of the time you don t really get a good answer for anything related to hotel facilities or even tips around the hotel people who visit the bar are treated better than guests who are staying at the hotel and want to geab a drink i didn t understand the 2 hotels concept the spa was on one side the duchess and we were staying in the exchange what the difference also a w should have a bliss spa it is a landmark 
 nothing
 closed rooftop bar early every night we were there even at 8pm 1 night when it states open til 11pm some of staff not nice at all and said on arrival wanted to pay room in cash said be fine then 2 days after staying room key was blocked went down and they said payment by card wasn t working when already told wanted to pay in cash trying to charge by card and locking us out room to get our attention many times had to go and have room key reset as not working in the lifts etc v annoying restaurant in house very expensive possible bed bugs bites after sleeping each night 
 room was so clean breakfast could be better
 no
 long check in time 
 the cost of watching movies and that the original price i seen for a 2 night stay at the hotel on booking com was 250 and due to me having to ask permission to book this hotel i went back on to book and it cost 372 which was a substantial jump within a day i still booked the hotel based on its location and the holiday inn reputation
 prices for food too high so didn t eat here at all 
 going home
 breakfast spread could have been better
 everything was fine staff welcoming helpful and friendly
 rooms look old and the floor making creaking sound room amenities and breakfast could have been better 
 shower leaked on bathroom floor
 nothing
 no shelf in shower to put gel shampoo on
 the wifi was occasionally a little flakey 
 hotel bars lacked atmosphere and were more like libraries 
 prices within the hotel were very expensive we paid 23 for two drinks and there was a service charge
 car parking is expensive 
 i was surprised that you have stopped stocking the fridge 
 wifi
 too many lift changes and corridors to get from reception to your room
 we didn t have breakfast but the choices were very limited 
 electrics in room didn t work had to move our daughter arrived next day and was put in our original room electrics still didn t work she had to move she was very cold that night and asked for blankets they never came many items in rooms e g dirty old switches need upgrading 
 nothing to dislike
 nothing
 the bed
 dishes and glass ware dirty in restaurant weeds around the swimming pool no parasol or shades at the pool
 the room was the smallest i have ever had in london therefore it was greatly overpriced 
 room a tad small but is a small boutique hotel 
 nothing that i dont like 
 breakfast was very expensive 20 pounds person so we went outside 
 rooms are small for the price complex wifi log in breakfast expensive
 paying extra for eggs at breakfast after paying 17 for the normal breakfast no desk and chair in the room minimal noise proofing rather loud small window looking into an air vent so no natural light too expensive for what it turns out is a mediocre tourist hotel
 lamp and hairdryer not working in our room there seemed to be a constant smell of curry wafting down the corridor outside our room which was a bit too much no help offered with our bags luggage upon trying to exit the hotel and we waved our own cab outside when there was two members of staff there 
 very small room no food after 9pm even though room service bar food was advertised until 9 30 pm
 concierge could be more helpful in giving recommendations for restaurants they were not very engaged and enthusiastic
 the tapp was leaking and the shower s temperature would keep changing dramatically 
 we didn t know we needed the key card to activate the lights felt kinda silly when we called the front desk 
 the smoking room could do with a air filtration system installed to give it a more outdoor feel 
 the locked window then theyy opened it 2 inches so all well 
 the 18 euro cost of the breakfast was a slight excessive
 heating not working in our room which was disappointing 
 we were happy with everything at the hotel 
 over priced for what we paid for booked family room and we re given small room with hard campbed which was brought in as after thought hotel couldn t find my booking despite booking well in advance very disappointed overall
 i had a tiny room in the basement i had to jump over my bed to get out of the bathroom nowhere to get any water to drink incredibly expensive for what you are getting regardless of the location probably the worst part of the whole stay was that the bed sheets and pillows were really really damp 
 the mix up with the bill the breakfast cooked to order food was not good 
 slept on double bed one side against wall no room to walk over to the side there were enough tea and coffee but only 4 jiggers of milk so had to phone housekeeping to let us have some more mirror on the desk was fixed so had to use one in bathroom but no light above the mirror asked for decaf at breakfast and found tea on table when came back and i never drink tea with breakfast 
 there is nothing bad to say about this place loved it will book again in the future 
 nothing perfect 
 room was small and we requested to be moved as we didn t have slippers and bathrobe as stated in room description manager was great at giving us much better room
 friendly staff but not too helpful in recommending bars or restaurants in the area 
 not applicable
 extremely poor customer service one has to be extremely careful with his possessions on this property 
 for a 5 tv in room was way too small shower knobs were very seized up and difficult to adjust no complimentary bottled water in room which i would expect in a hotel of this standard 
 what i didn t like 1 no free water 2 i requested one water they charged me the water price and delivery to my room price 3 no fan in the toilet no small drainage hole in the toilet some water stayed in the bathroom until house keeping clean it especially if you have kids taking bath and playing with water 
 the hotel was cramped and claustrophobic there was practically no space in the room to work the bathroom was tiny and we both had difficulty using the shower because we had to step over the toilet bowl to get through the door there was little space shelf to put soap and razors flannels were not provided which is unusual in a modern hotel these days
 no slippers in the room 
 none 
 wi fi in the room was poor and while i in the end did not have to pay for it wifi at the hotel was originally advertised at nearly 10 for usage per day only one bar which is very expensive and has no draught beer 
 breakfast can be more diverse
 had to change room two times was erroneously booked for 3 person changed room had probleml with air system after we had unpacked and had to change another room thus one was ok but noisy due to the construction next door for a hotel this size and isolated location there wasn t a restaurant for dinner only a lounge 
 there was a bad smell that came from the drains which came into the bathroom 
 breakfast was poor cold and not very good quality coffee undrinkable would not have even bothered going for it
 old decor small rooms there are no queen beds in the double rooms and bed comforts are below average the only thing going for it is the location too expensive for a holiday inn 
 staff slow to provide back little stuff missing in the room had to down to reception after asking 3 times
 we had a communication problem with the staff even if we wanted a double bed they gave a twin bed even if we paid the bill in advance they acted as if we were swindlers maybe because of the darkness of the decoration they were kind of skeptics apart from this the furniture is old and the elevator makes too much noise i felt like i was in the hotel in barton fink 
 it was really warm in the room even with the windows open we couldn t use the street in front of the entrance which made it a bit inconvenient carrying stuff from the car parking down the stairs to the hotel entrance we missed the american pancakes at the breakfast buffet 
 the cleanliness was not good linen quality was not of a slh hotel breakfast variety is very poor
 the rooms are a bit too small 
 it s not necessarily bad but the wifi isn t great and only one device can connect there were 2 of us but only 1 phone could use the wifi we stayed 5 nights room was very nice but view was facing a wall 
 it s probably a bit overpriced yes the hotel is lovely and very fancy and all that but we paid around 200 euro per night but our room was kind of small thats the only negative thing i could say everything else was excellent 
 nothing i recommend 
 parking too expensive
 didn t get wake up call booked on arrival for day of departure could have been a problem as was catching very early flight but had set own personal alarms as a backup thankfully 
 a small point but a swimming pool and spa would have been the cherry on the cake
 the rooms were quite tired in appearance lots of marks on the walls stains on the carpets etc 
 the whole point of me choosing to pay the extra for this hotel was for the rooftop pool area unfortunately it was hired out for events and we weren t allowed to use it unless we bought tickets a small refund or compensation wouldn t of gone a miss
 everthing fine
 i did ask for a twin room but had a sofa bed instead which was not very comfortable
 the upgraded room was very good but the club bar was not found to be good value we were told there would be sandwiches and cakes all that very enjoyable on the whole we were offered was sausage roll and volavonts
 delays in checking in not cooperating for check out no complimentary no water i
 had tgey also had a sauna they would have been priceless for tourists from russia and northern europe 
 room size is a little bit small for marriott hotel 
 the hotel presentation was good in the front reception areas but could do with some serious attention to maintenance in the room we were in on the 4th floor the room was described as an executive room but we have had better quality at well known budget hotels for a lot less money 
 the noise in the morning
 the rooms were not ready on time at 2pm the queue for breakfast not complaints just points to note 
 subway noise and vibration 
 more frosting on the shower and toilet walls just a little too revealing a small bar would have been nice but there was a mini bar in the room and plenty of bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel 
 the rooms are a bit smaller than expected and the bed wasn t overly comfortable too soft 4 star hotel with no bath robes the bar staff member we were served by wasn t very friendly he seemed disinterested in his job 
 that the breakfast eggs tasted of curry 
 have some misunderstanding about dry cleaning express 
 
 i have no complaints
 very poor breakfast table 
 bar closed at midnight tv football match turned off at midnight would have liked to be able to relax a little longer after a long drive in the car 
 nothing 
 room was a tad small 
 charged twice and was a building site
 aircondition is only heating in the winter it become very hot in nice days
 way too much noise the rooms are not at all sound insulated the non stop music makes it impossible to rest during the day and until late at night the fact that you have to haul your luggage to your room in a hotel of this category is a scandal no closet to put your clothes into 
 small room and low celling hairdryer been broken
 a refurbishment might be a good idea noisy couldn t close double glazing unit
 at first they put us into a room with no bath having requested one and the room was quite small for a mature couple but that was quickly resovled and we were relocated to room121
 little note the chips in the frigobar had expired this did not have to happen 
 very expensive for what they are offering the parking is also a nightmare around there and the daily charge from the hotel ridiculous
 
 stayed twice in both cases ac did not work properly in march it wasn t a problem 
 breakfast very poor hot food cold and too expensive
 the view was of the building works at the back of the hotel was not happy with this after reading that people had fantastic views 
 the room was advertised as a deluxe double the room was big enough for a single bed and certainly should not be referred to as a deluxe double on the day we arrived there was a white hairbrush on the floor beside the locker so the room was not cleaned properly i didn t pick it up the next day it was on the locker when we arrived back the rooms should be cleaned thoroughly between guests lockers etc should be pulled out and the area cleaned the description of the room size caused us great disappointment for the money we paid i have used booking com before but i am not sure if i will use it again 
 a lot of construction going on in the area
 breakfast was a bit expensive better choices and prices outside of the hotel 
 the lounge really isn t a lounge and it is just a pity there isn t more space available for this but i understand that it is the best that can be made out of what limited space is available
 unfortunately my plane was delayed by two hour because of thunder storms so i arrived at 22 30 my checkin was an absolute disaster the reloje suite that i had booked and was confirmed to me via booking s reservation confirmation was given to an other client who had reserved a family suite that was give to me afterwards since the people did not like their family room the front desk manager lucy at reception took on her to give my room away all though confirmed to me to an other guest i had specially booked the reloje suite because i needed to have a table for 6 for meetings since i had interviews and meetings on top of that i travel with a lot of it for work so i need space when i arrived for check in at 22 30 the receptionist tatiana checked me in seemed trobled when asked her if there was a problem she said management had decided not to give me the suite when i insited arguing i had a confirmed suite they said air conditioning was not working then it was under construction oh i said so if it is under constriction no one is staying in the room so i would like to see it that was impossible and refused they tried to lie there way out of it this is unacceptable lucy did not care since she knew i had no other alternatives this caused delays agravation and a lot trouble for my meetings this is not acceptable the next day i complained to senior management and two hours later they gave me a tower suite and i did not have to pay for the first night i did appreciate the management s gesture but did not compensate for the trouble and time i lost i am still waiting for a formal excuse letter that i have not received until now i will probably never receive it i can only advice to all travellers to beware and make sure you confirme before your arrival at the hotel 
 faulty towers everything is bad room size and layout dreadful no hot water from when we arrived early evening until an hour or so before we left next morning when hotel reception informed we were laughed at dreadful breakfast asked for 2 fried eggs as scrambled looked appealing these took approx 20 mins very poor service from a hotel in an otherwise nice area of london 
 we were still in the room when the cleaner came we had left 30 mins later but the cleaner never returned this was disappointing we later found out that you should have had the ability to reschedule the cleaner but we did not have the relevant tools to do this in our room 
 unfriendly staff at the check in tv didn t work properly very noisy no euro power connectors and a hard bargain to borrow one
 all good
 concierge was never there when we needed assistance furniture in our room was damaged room location was poor given long advanced reservation
 restaurant staff a bit untrained
 nothing
 friday and saturday nights some noise disturbance from restaurants bars close by
 method of payment staff member at reception took my card on arrival and took 168 when my room was supposed to cost 118 and did not explain why she had done this and was quite rude when questioned after contacting the hotel afterwards they explained that the difference is refunded afterwards which is a little strange but nevertheless was never explained to us 
 breakfast buffet could be more extensive
 i find it difficult to sleep under a thick duvet in summer a very thin one would have been better but that s just me 
 a water of bottle in the room would be much appreciated 
 the room is nothing like the newly renovated photo shown in booking com it s very old would not book this hotel if i know it s this old there is a frequent machine noise in the room which we suspected is the elevator motor it s very annoying 
 nothing
 staff could have been a little more welcoming and cheerful they were a little distant and not overly friendly maybe that s just the way the french are 
 cleanning
 couldn t really work the mobile device and had to go down to find internet code 
 noise outside my window
 there is no much food choice neaby
 we skipped the breakfast plan given it seemed a little expensive for the options they had several excellent and less expensive options in the area 
 less expensive champagne in the mini bar in my room ha ha
 nothing
 we booked this as it had been described as luxurious and because it was a special birthday we had wanted luxury so didn t mind paying more than our usual premier inn choice we were really disappointed in the low standard of the room and had to upgrade to a king we felt that the premier inn at euston was better and felt really let down 
 room very small but only stayed one night not a big problem
 after paying 300 for two nights they then tried to charge an extra 27 for breakfast luckily the aforementioned wetherspoons provided it for 12 
 noise of staff including housekeeping outside our room slamming doors from 6am knocking loudly on neighboring doors from 9am 
 it took forever for the hot water to run through very small lifts 
 we didn t like the location still a bit far from the major attractions also the fridge weren t working properly so we couldn t have cold water and the noise we couldn t rest at all night till about 2am and mornings were early for us because of the housekeeping working next door 
 the room is small is old fashioned and needs an update the corridor was quite noisy although i asked for a quiet room there also was no flexibility towards a slightly later check out time price quality is lacking there were no dutch news papers in the lobby 
 welcome at reception
 our stay included free use of pool gym steam room etc i wouldn t complain because they were free but had i have paid i would have been disappointed the steam room and sauna were a strange shape which meant you could really fit no more than 4 people in 
 probably the worst breakfast i have ever had in a hotel even 1 star hotels manage to offer something better in case there is a breakfast place next to the hotel and it is very good walls are very thin you will know all the life of your neighbours 
 this was my at least 4 th stay in the hotel i paid the room with my credit card from the price announced in your web site while making check in they wanted to charge to my credit card 50 gbp per night of stay 250 gbp as security they have no minibars in the rooms so what security i have a polish credit card and when is charged and returned later i am loosing from exchange rate this i had once in the past in turkey they said lot of arguments with no base like to register my credit card in their system i told them that i made the payment with my credit card and finally they wanted me to deposit 100 gbp cash i did since i have got tired of discussing with several people you have to mention this at your booking side during check in clients are asked 50 gbp deposit per night of stay i will not book this hotel as long as they do not change their policy i am not happy at all vith my last visit 
 our bedroom door was open very early in the morning despite a do not disturb sign on the door we immediately called reception but received no feedback still waiting for their email a week later 
 distance
 the water took too long to heat up
 nothing
 the floor of the room not so clean 
 poor breakfast room was not very clean 
 bar staff unfriendly and slow to react to customers 
 i don t have anything in mind actually just please fix your printer because my receipt was printed with a streak on the page that s it 
 i didn t like the way the beds in the bedroom looked it had space in between so you can realy lean back from the middle you had to always lean from the sides that was a bad experience 
 nothing
 the lamp shades in our room should have been replaced a long time ago 
 very poor service not safe to stay staff are very rude to customers room is in poor condition never go there ever again 
 the decor was dated and the bath had some chips in it the starbucks franchise coffee is more expensive than the starbucks accross the churchyard
 no breakfast included in the price of the stay towels in bathroom were not 5 star 
 thicker bed covers as room a little cold
 was a bit disappointed we had booked dinner and not in the main restaurant but were put in a small dining room with no atmosphere as there was a function going on that night 
 parking elevator has been broken
 basement room with window facing the pavement room very small not as impressive as it looks on the web site
 there for royle garden party whether rain and sun but worm when going out over you an umbrella great touch
 nothing
 liked everything
 i have no negative comments 
 nothing
 no clear window to outside couldn t tell if it was sunny or raining before leaving the hotel allocated disabled room so no bath tv poor quality picture sound with few channels 
 we didn t spend too much time at the hotel as we had an itinerary planned ahead of arrival we just wanted a good hotel which was central to our needs
 price of breakfast too expensive when staying as a family
 wouldn t allow me to charge the company credit card initially provided i had to pay out off pocket upon checkout despite being told earlier by a different member of staff that i would be able to really ruined my stay at the hotel will not return 
 service had to chase roomstaff all the time no water forgot breakfast dishes no water glasses replace shower gel etc
 didn t have a bad experience but considering we paid over 400 and was ment to be staying in an queen suit we were slightly disappointed in the size and poshness of our room
 did not like the toilet paper 
 view from the hotel room there was none
 all v good really
 size of room limited facilities 
 nothing but if you want to be in the heart of the city it might not be for you however its only a ten minute taxi 
 room could if been bigger
 wifi didn t work temperature in room is no so good 
 room was cramped needs a bit of a revamp 
 noise from furniture or something being dragged about early each morning 
 one of the kitchen chefs barked at me for failing to close the serving tray who needs that at 7am single room was quite small but still workable 
 no slipper in the room room is quite small the location is not as good as expected 
 drinks were very expensive in the roof terrace bar but excellent view and every body visiting should go and take a look 
 the lift is a bit confusing but does it job 
 the device for switching air condition off on or changing temperature airflow in the room doesn t work only reception can do it for the guest on request during the breakfast it s practically impossible to receive additional cup teapot of just hot water 
 everythink was perfect
 the noise of vehicles being raced outside at 1am in the morning
 the one thing i would fault was the meal i had in the restaurant a fantastic view but the food did not measure up being bland and flavourless i had the ravioli and the monkfish both disappointing so whilst i might return to the hotel the food was a huge disappointment 
 too hot
 very very small room and not sound proofed room it is not 4 star hotel the bath is not comfortable 
 no coffee tea available in room
 the insulation from noise shud be better
 interior in rooms is getting old and shows signs of wear and tear walls between rooms are thin and not very well sound insulated 
 small room
 location next to dlr train line too noisy breakfast room for hot food not a good layout egg service needs to be first and toaster area somewhere else
 nothing
 noise coming from corridors sink was not functioning properly
 that the waiter woke us up at 2am knocking the door saying we had ordered wine when we hadn t and the fact we had to get our own coffee at breakfast as the waiters were not around 
 small room
 bedroom tiny nothing like the image shown picture shows two bedside tables and room either side on double bedroom reality one double bed pushed up to a wall and one bedside table tiny bathroom not very romantic when you have to climb over your other half to go to the bathroom 
 wifi in rooms very poor
 booked for 2 double rooms went about half 1 to check in to be told rooms weren t ready and to come back later this was fine we left bags and come back about half 5 checked in and got given 1 set of keys when she went to do other room she said there is only single rooms available we said this wasn t on as we d booked 2 doubles she then went to say the key she d given me had 3 single beds she said she would talk to manager took about 10mins she came back and said we d been upgraded i m glad we did i wouldn t have liked to see the rooms we d booked our upgraded ones were very basic beds are ok but not worth the money 
 not much storage space in room
 everything was great 
 nothing to fault 
 i requested for two things high level and canel view or river view but non of them i got 
 bar was closed at noon
 nothing
 there was a very strong smell of paint in my room and the corridor
 breakfast staff very rude i had to ask 3 times for a cup of tea at breakfast most hotels offer you a pot when it did come it was slammed down in front of me also whenever i ve stayed at a double tree hilton we ve been given warm cookies on arrival this wasn t offered but must have been available as i saw other guests with them 
 small rooms 
 no hand shower
 the room very small 
 not informed that the restaurant and bar not open in august a few minor niggles with room wardrobe door not on runners properly and showerhead loose a few drawers would be nice for storing bits 
 the breakfast bufuet
 quite small bathroom but more than made up for by being in central london
 maid used just come in at times without knocking 
 the food is horrible
 rooms were and facilities within room weredated
 first night i was not put in the deluxe room that i had paid extra for and i suffered a disturbed night s sleep with noisy neighbouring guests breakfast has the potential to be somewhat oversubscribed with some items running out 
 basic hotel would have liked an extra chair or stand for luggage 
 building works
 window coverings in bathroom didn t give privacy which was a bit disconcerting as we were on first floor 
 the hotel is very rigid with chekin and checkout we had arrived at 8am and the usually chekin was between 1 and 2pm and the hotel was not flexible in offering a room to rest and the lobby is simply a short corridor with 4 chairs so no where to rest we were expecting a more lenient treatment for checkin considering we have 2 kids they accepted we stay by the pool till the room was ready at 1 30pm pool is tiny round one and we couldn t stay long for a long relaxing morning at checkout we wanted to extend for couple of hours we didn t even mind moving to one small room to freshen up before our late flight the only option the hotel had for us is to pay an extra hourly rate we thought this is very unfriendly especially with family of 2 kids the breakfast time was flexible tthough till midday but we didn t like the quality at all the rooms are not clean at all and we used the coffee mugs and glasses for juice the room cleaners simply kept them unwashed for the entire 5 days of our visit the reception staff and the breakfast room staff where nice and tried accommodating to our request but we felt they had no flexibility with their management i would rate it a 3star except the nice interiors which deserves 4star 
 breakfast was disappointing buffet was limited 
 the restaurant was expensive 
 not enough staff at breakfast
 there is no way this hotel is worth the money i paid for it the room was tiny the decor faded the bed on a tilt in summary a hole i couldn t recommend to anybody it would need to be half the price for this to be value for money 
 nothing interesting about the rooms rather functional 
 as it was soffit attic the ceiling was quite short in one side of the room and especially in the bathroom shower so some caution is needed 
 the bathtub without handle bar to assist getting in out has safe issue
 nothing springs to mind great base
 i booked the place mainly for the pool recommended by the doctor to exercise prior to a knee surgery upon arrival i was informed the pool has 15 degrees and expected to have had this information at booking moment the person at reception was polite yet i felt a forced politeness when talking about the subject blamed booking com for this lack of information as he mentioned it was sent to booking com not bathrobe and sleepers in the room in a spa hotel they had and required one in the room yet i was told to go down at spa to take them no trouble whatsoever but expected them to bring them in the room at a 4 stars service a simple change of attitude could increase the ratings of the overall experience 
 no turn down service at all when i asked the front desk why a so called 5 was not providing such a service or any water on the bed night table bring your own it it will cost you 5euros from the minibar i received a very unpleasant answer but a promise to have one for my second night well it did not happen personnel around the hotel is just very unpleasant also forgot my electric toothbrush in the room called only a few hours later and they had thrown it away will not go back 
 mini bar in the room was empty when i asked the room service to put some stuf in to the refrigerator they informed me that they would charge me extra 6 euros for bringing up the drinks in addition to the cost of the consumed items i think this was very unusual so i gave up 
 there s a construction next to the hotel which is beyond the hotel s control anyway 
 having to pay for wifi
 hair drier not very good 
 view from standard room was of building next door but if paid more would have had better view i presume 
 hotel is tired room furniture is worn shower was tricky really needs an overhaul 
 the bathroom is small the sink is cracked and no wash cloths bed not very comfortable two twin beds joined together to make a double bed during the night till early morning we can hear noises of people talking loud laughing and probably drunk 
 the rooms are small the breakfast was not included even though with this rate
 poor room service
 this is not a complaint more a funny comment the bed was so high that you almost needed a ladder to get into it made us both laugh especially when my wife was trying to get into bed 
 nothing really 
 no complimentary drinking water provided on a daily basis no bedroom slippers provided no laundry bags provided and tea and coffee facilities have to be collected by oneself 
 the view of the first floor area from the rear car park was tatty ie curtains in room
 both pool areas were always busy due the small layout of both pools had to get up early to reserve a bed at full capacity in the summer this would be a nightmare no kettle or iron in the room which was not good for me 
 too expensive we left some headphones by mistake and they didn t find it 
 no outside are to sit terrace and enjoy drinks away from room 
 small room no room for a chair steep stairs no lift down to breakfast room
 lobby is old and outdated and elevator is tiny was worried when i checked in but the room was awesome which is all that really mattered 
 nothing
 the room and bathroom very small
 the fact that i only stayed a single night 
 everything
 nothing
 nothing
 rooms are very tight especially the front door couldn t swing open bigger and was a step down from the corridor floor some more difficult to pull my luggage in 
 very small room
 cold food it was inedible and the price you pay for substandard food is not acceptable poor shower water flow quicker to have washed in basin than in the shower again this should not have been left like this for the cost you pay for the night pretty let down
 nothing
 stuff in lounge restaurant is impolite totally luxury ept 
 distance from centre
 small double bed
 my room was a little smaller than expected for a queen room the pillows were a little to soft for my liking but not a massive issue 
 everything was perfect 
 small rooms drafty windows terrible bathrooms noise
 room confort wasn t enough
 room service food was terrible stale sandwiches and cold chips breakfast staff were unfriendly
 the hot water boiler broke down so no hot water at all very bad 
 hand lotion innrooms would be nice
 very small bathroom
 shower a bit tight breakfast variety and layout needs improvement e g single two hole toaster for the buffet breakfast 
 the toilet was not clean upon arrival but was cleaned as soon as we called housekeeping
 sullen staff in restaurant when we wanted a midday bite to eat and drinks seriously inattentive for a hotel of this calibre we were shown or pointed to a table and ignored for 20 minutes
 rooms are a bit outdated
 one room was ready and the other wasn t and had to wait such a long time well over half an hour for the second room to be ready we had requested an early check in too as it was a special occasion but didn t get the room until about 2 45pm 
 sauna was odd as there was no dressing room and no bathropes offered 
 bad costumer service
 room too tight ease of upgrading
 only had one pillow no spares i love sleeping on 2
 nothing comes to mind 
 no on site parking
 the bed was 2 twins pushed together and they were different levels the mattress was lumpy and needs replacing i was on the 2nd floor and the room overlooked the tube line i didn t have a good nights sleep 
 nothing really 
 no desk in the room to put the computer and work small room 
 too cool for school staff saturday night is club night
 room was outdated
 enjoyed our stay but one of the gentleman reception staff on the evening shift wasn t friendly at all very abrupt was even unpleasant to the other staff 
 the room was disgustingly small and to pay around 190 for one night was daylight robbery i certainly would not stay there again 
 the bathroom floods because of the unsealed shower door although they clean it everyday some of the staff have difficulty speaking english
 the dinner that is provided in the hotel is quite poor in choice and quality almost every dish is heavily spiced so if you consider having a dinner in the hotel please think twice the breakfast is ok on the other hand so i d recommend to take it 
 no bad experience 
 nothing 
 coffe machine in the room didn t work properly 
 it was a brief visit and all was good i didn t have breakfast as the price seems ridiculous though it seems standard
 rooms are small 
 the steaks we had in the hotel restaurant were very sinewy and fatty although the steak was returned twice it still came back sinewy very disappointing 
 nothing
 the milk in the complimentary mini bar was curdled but in date breakfast wasn t very organised we were given a table we went to get breakfast and when we got back our table had been given to someone else so we were given a different table that turned out to be someone else s table will be having room service next time 
 could ve been cheaper 
 besides the hotel being near the excel centre theres not to much around sure you could get the dlr around london but still also the dinner prices were a bit expensive but thats london prices i guess
 long narrow pillows 
 facilities for children are poor though the hotel is right next to a wonderful beach which would appeal 
 the room was very small but i can deal with it because the location and friendly staff my problem was the cleaning crew chatting and laughing loudly outside of my door every morning that just bothers me so much as i tried to sleep in on a saturday morning after long week working in london it happened again sunday morning i gave up i had no idea what they were saying because i didn t understand their language so i couldn t laugh with them 
 no bad experience everything was perfect
 rooms were small size than expected
 room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no fresh air
 everything was fabulous but the cleaning staff although cleaned the rooms exceptionally well they forgot to put mugs in on one day and another day forgot to put towels in but wasn t a problem quick call to reception and they brought them up to us
 room smelt musty windows streaming with water reception staff particularly miserable and unhelpful did not activate key or hand out wifi details so had to go back down to reception twice
 they rooms were small there wasn t any plug sockets near any mirrors so was difficult to see when doing hair using straightens and hair dryer 
 the appearance on the internet is that this hotel directly faces the river which appealed to me as i sleep with a window open but in fact there is a road and quite a busy walkway in front of the hotel we asked to be moved to the back of the hotel and luckily there was a room 
 i called reception 3 times one morning and each time i was told that they would call me back no such luck
 nothing would thoroughly recommend this hotel
 room service the currys where cold when they got to us and for 17 each you would expect at least warm food the bed was very hard and uncomfortable
 can t think of any 
 minor issue at reception but it was quickly resolved so not problem there 
 noisy guests at 3am who were then very aggressive and rude very small bed not a double 
 the room was like a corridor turned into a room not a nice room 
 too small room
 noise of other guestroom doors opening access to main building in the evening confusing no ordinary tea available for breakfast and waiter very abrupt 
 breakfast is diversified and good but a little expansive 
 view from the room found a hair on robe when we arrived we was made to pay 100 incase of any problems with room an also when we went to breakfast they didn t know if we had paid for it or not
 located next to railway station which is using a speaker system in the late evening and early morning which ruins your sleep 
 the room was not a 5 star quality the carpet was coming away and lumpy at the bathroom door it was not sound proofed could hear the next room talking at night and our room was over looking the dining room which i thought was a little odd 
 breakfast need improvement
 brighter lighting by wardrobe area superior double is very very small 
 ideally the room could have been a bit bigger ditto the bathroom but for the price and the convenience of the location it was fine 
 the room was small superior double and a bit dated the mattres was old and not very comfortable the booking was for two people but room was set up only for one the breakfast selection was very small and poor quality bread hard tomatoes gone off no traditional produce available very disappointing 
 service at the breakfast that was not included in our reservation was very poor we felt that breakfast should have been included in the price we were not aware that people who registered at the hotel were offered the free breakfast and booking com did not mention it 
 nice rooms but poor room layout bathroom night light was a little annoying as the bath room had a glass door which faced the bed could benefit from more diverse bar snacks olives spiced nuts etc 
 room was comfortable but a bitt tired furntiture a bit worn bathroom dated and stains on carpet
 having to leave 
 nothing
 the bathroom decor could perhaps do with updating 
 paying 24 per head for breakfast and then being expected to pay 7 extra for pancakes is unacceptable there is a lot of work going on next to the hotel and we were put in a room facing a building site not a good start to my husbands birthday weekend to which the receptionist had told us they would do something special on the day of his birthday to which no avail 
 no pool smal rooms wifi was in and out took forever to get a cocktail in the lobby
 faulty washbasin plug too few reception staff 
 small room 
 the room is old with small bath place poor wife and noise from outside can be heard clearly at night 
 breakfast was grim orange juice smelt funny majority of staff miserable avoid eye contact
 breakfast too expensive 
 lack of originality in the room executive suite too much standard 
 cleaning service sometimes didn t put new towel and didn t make a turn down service 
 the room was really small with a tiny window with view to the air conditions system of the hotel 
 the hotel decoration is old and we could not prevent the light penetrating the room early in the morning 
 absolutely no complaints at all 
 nothing
 door to balcony doesn t close street too loud 
 not really a negative but at the price it would be nice to have breakfast included that said the breakfasts served downstairs in the cafe were fantastic 
 the pillows
 bed was a little hard for my personal preference and it was two singles pushed together but not a big deal
 no lift hotel goes to fourth floor if you don t like stairs ask for a low floor 
 the room was a bit small
 the bill was a lot more than expected i used the express checkout so did not have a copy it came to 836 i stayed for 2 days which was at 100 per day 200 i did hot spend another 600 on food and drink please look into this for me and report back
 the breakfast needs to more nicer the variety of food eggs smoked salmon etc 
 breakfast was not great 
 the surrounding needs cleaning up 
 the view from our room but to be honest it was not that bad if i wanted view i could of stayed somewhere else for a lot more money so not really a big problem 
 absolutely not worth the money 255 for one night stay there were stains on the chairs in the room not what you expect at that cost per night very basic for the very high price 
 bad air condition to be more precise it is not an air condition it a joke we stayed in one bedroom apartment the thing that they called air condition is only in the sitting area do you imagine a bedroom with out an air condition homeless around the hotel dirty carpet and small rooms
 room furniture needs refurbishing bathroom fixtures definitely old
 breakfast was packed and the staff was moving very quickly just to keep up so there was a delay in eating as they refilled and a line for most things the hotel is very close to the train station and the neighborhood around is just ok if you are looking for the elegant higher en d neighborhood this may not be it it does change dramatically from one block to the next we did not metro home at night because of this and took a cab instead
 we thought the cost of linking to wifi was expensive 
 our room was tiny but i believe they have larger ones the place is undergoing some renovation it is a little tired old and dusty 
 unfortunately when we were there the rooftop bar was closed as it only opens in summer not sure why as weather in barcelona allows to stay outside already in may when we were there there was a private party in the garden on our first night with loud music until midnight that we couldn t avoid even in the bedroom finally there was no door to the bathroom and when we asked whether there was another room available with a door to the bathroom we were told that this was only available for luxury superior rooms it seems odd that this is a luxury in this category of hotel 
 a little bit expensive however all in all superb experience 
 they said in the review section the breakfast is great but it s not not enough for the 4 star level
 perfect
 breakfast was meant to be included but the hotel is having work done so no eating facilities available yet my booking cost included breakfast 
 hotel quite a walk to nearest trams to the centre and some attractions very few nice bars restaurants in the immediate vicinity 
 traffic noise
 6 60 for a bottle of beer are you having a laugh 
 weak conditioner
 the towels weren t too white and not of a good quality cotton as it wasn t thick and didn t smell good
 could not name one thing 
 the room key is old and difficult to open
 matresses not good for a couple toilet is not soundproof and there where things under the bed left from the previous guests not easy access to the city also 
 some staff members should be more informed about how credit cards via booking com works 
 highly disappointed after a long day off site seeing and getting around london to finally get back to my hotel at 8pm to be told the bar wasn t open to residents
 no view of any kind if not for this we would have given it full marks 
 we only found one comfy pillow but then again its a personal preference issue and perhaps there could be a few more sunbeds around the pool
 nothing at all
 the room was too small
 the housekeepers were very annoying we had 2 rooms with a connecting door open at the day of check out the housekeepers knocked and entered both rooms before 12 00 for several times they obviously wanted to clean and leave work faster but we didn t like to be annoyed like this in our rooms before the check out time this fact spoilt the whole impression of the hotel 
 small rooms
 the restaurant for the breakfast is too small so sometimes you have to wait for a table and it is almost impossible to have a table for 4 
 minor issues like leaky faucet
 none 
 small mistakes we asked for an additional paper in the morning which was confirmed with staff but didn t arrive the wrong food order was initially taken breakfast we asked for poached eggs on toast and the toast came 5 minutes later a hotel of this calibre shouldn t be making such mistakes all happened on a one night stay 
 too expensive
 the only thing i couldn t work out was the room temperature controls it might help to provide instructions of how to operate them 
 nothing 
 very expensive for what you get
 small reception
 group of young boys a couple of rooms down that kept everyone up all night
 room and bathroom absolutely tiny too small for a couple no room for a chair so clothes ended up on floor hanging space drop was too short for even a shirt nowhere for a case 
 no milk in room and didn t fancy requesting it while wrapped in a towel coffee percolater not brilliant but still a lovely hotel
 would have preferred slightly more choice at breakfast
 the swimming pool is quite good but just to say something the lighting and the ceiling could be improved a bit 
 the room wasn t very clean there were hair in the bathroom when we arrived the next day after the room was cleaned the hair were still there it seemed as if they were moped around the floor the kitchen wasn t cleaned after we used it and dirty dishes were left in the sink with no provision of dish soap and sponge for us to wash the dishes 
 no kitten to heat water the wi fi was weak 
 depending on layout of room you hear sounds of next door don t like so much loud beeping sound when you enter your room 
 hot breakfast was all cold
 room needed updating rate was too high for last night 
 lady on the reception was rude and she s not professional 
 a little facelift would be good our bathroom was lovely but the toilet had a constant hiss however staff was friendly location was good near abbey road and 2 stops from london euston
 very small lift but no real issue in well designed and maintained older building 
 not all stuff members were that nice neighborhood is not the most fascinating it needs a good walk down the river to see interesting places 
 crowded people at lobby therefore delay in checking in and out a lot of meeting at first floor the room wasn t insulting 
 the breakfast area was very cramped and the cheese and ham were not fresh limited choices available the nearest car park was some distance away from the hotel 
 new part doesn t feel as new as it should parking can be very tricky if you re late and the bar doesn t have much choice
 not being able to book the same room for the same rate next week 
 a bit pricy and extended stay was restricted to 3 pm for half a day far from attractions but the tram in front of the hotel made transportation easier there is also a metro a few minutes walk away 
 bar prices but it was london 
 the room was very small we had no place for our 2 suitcases 
 very tired no ac in rooms
 i think 11 for the continental and 14 for the full english breakfast is a bit steep and i would not bother if bought separately the deal we had included breakfast and so overall was good value for such a location between victoria and pimlico stations 
 pricey pool menu
 we had the worst check in experience ever we had a small problem with our credit card that was going to be resolved later that day by our bank fernanda the hotel receptionist not only did not helped at all but she was rude to us by all means made us feel uncomfortable and bad threatened us that she was going to cancel our booking due to an invalid credit card finally of course we gave another credit card this was not a problem for us but honestly we have never felt so uncomfortable and undesirable upon check in to a hotel all the other members of the staff were really great though very helpful and kind p s fernanda when you see a backpacker checking in to 4 star hotel it doesn t mean that he she doesn t have any money to pay for the hotel so treat all the guests equally and not with an attitude of rudeness with an extra sence of irony 
 think 25 for breakfast is a bit steep
 we got the 5 th floor room and as the elevator only goes up to 4th floor we had to climb the final flight of stairs the room was a quite small we are aware that london boutique hotel rooms tend to be small but it s a surprise each time 
 a bit off the beaten track whitechapel tube
 24 limit on wifi then had to re join 
 old farnechar
 the one lady in breakfast area was like a matron and suspicious of us taking food cause on the first day i did not know i could not take a muffin with me out of breakfast area the marble polisher driller was a bit of an irritating one 2 days working outside our door the tv had no english channels working and the technician sent was not knowing his job so never got tv to watch english bbc cnn news or sport
 noise in the hauls and door slamming from other guests very early in the morning or late in the evening 
 some people spend time looking for faults and i understand that reviews are a useful guide to future visitors i can not think of one negative to say about this hotel so i m not even going to try 
 trying to find directions from underground station to hotel was little challenging upon our arrival it was easy after we knew exactly where to go a provided link with clear walking directions from tube and dlr would have been very helpful 
 the walls are paper thin you can hear everything that happens in a room next to yours and i do mean everything snoring talking the lot add to it old wooden floors and you can say goodbye to a good night of rest it is a shame if not for this serious problem the hotel would be a gem 
 if you choose a road facing room you will here street noise although the outlook is nice internal facing rooms will probably be quieter 
 the only downside we had was that security continually approached asking us where we staying at the hotel never experienced that before it was funny at first but after the 5th time it was just annoying 
 hotel needs to be refreshed by new painting new moquet is advisable 
 rooms were in the small side however they were well laid out 
 food was poor particularly breakfast very unimaginative not as good as one might expect in a london hotel
 rooms sizes breakfast
 the receptionists are very nice but could use a brush up on their english skills bath room a bit worn in places and very damp 
 rooms are looking a bit tired so could do with a refresh chipped paint stained carpets
 the rooms are small for the price we pay
 nothing
 i got the room on first floor with ugly view and no other rooms available to change however to wander and travel around the most beautiful city let me forgot everythings 
 very small room hardly to find entrance no elevator
 very warm even with air con on beds hard but if it wasn t so warm you could probably sleep better expensive at match days and not worth what they charge at that time but if u get it at the normal rate it is well worth it also be careful if u book the room for someone else the card used to book had to be present at check in this is not clearly stated at time of booking you could be left standing with no toom beware and just to add breakfast is very expensive i thought 16 per person 
 noise of the road work being carried out currently road is busy still noisy 5 floors up 
 everything
 not a good selection for a meal in the evening
 i am compelled to pay stuff of mini bar that i have never consumed this is so ridiculous and i do not know it until i check my bank account i cannot believe what happened but i think it is the most dishonest hotel that i have experienced 
 whats not to like
 there s no sufdicient area to park the car at the fronf of hotel 
 no electric first night due to a problem with old lighting repaired next morning 
 late check in 
 the view from the room in the basement was terrible
 really enjoyed our stay although we spent very little time at the hotel with so much to do and see we did have a lovely meal at the hotel one evening which was really good value and tasty cheaper than some of the meals we had outside great to have the pool and a g t at the outdoor bar staff were good although service not always with a smile they were efficient and very accommodating 
 on entering our initial room there was a wet stain on the carpet we were moved to another room on request 
 staff where unattentive unhelpful and unfriendly considering i d just come from the dorchester i was expecting some kind of christmas theme as i was visiting around the holiday period there was not a christmas tree insight unfortunately the temperature of the room was uncontrollable not value for money 
 the overall service is too bad lack of knowledge and skills from the staff too rude and unpleasant staff dealing with the hotel need a serious renovation works breakfast seriously they can do better 
 bed was so soft it felt like you were sleeping on the floor thought london taxis were expensive but never get this hotel to book you one they double the price and some for making the call 
 there is nothing to mention here 
 didn t like that the sauna and steam room werent on asked a member of staff waited 15 mins but nobody came to turn then on 
 nothin
 we had a late snack at the hotel bar and it was quite expensive also the standard small shot of spirit is 50ml as opposed to 25ml which also makes the drinks expensive 
 chaotic management staff were shifting all the time when problems occured they said they would solve it in a friendly way but the problems were never solved the door lock was dead the first day we arrived so we had to change a room we lost something in that room and they promised to get it to us everyday we had to explain the situation to a new staff and the lost stuff never came back to us finally a supervisor promised to mail the stuff to us in newcastle but ten days has passed and still nothing all in all i don t recommend this place considering its high price and unpleasant service 
 it was a bit overpriced for an off season 
 although the bathroom sink tap had good pressure the shower didn t it was probably okay when new but the fancy fittings no longer work we suggest a plain one with better pressure and a soap dish or shelf in the cubicle as well also the wooden skirting around the walls in the main room was missing in some places and was a bit of a hazard otherwise the room was nice 
 fair amount of noise from corridor very expensive 
 i paid over 400 euros for a boxy badly designed room you couldn t see the tv from the sofa the cava they gave complimentary was undrinkable better to not offer anything than give a 5 euro bottle the pool was thick with chlorine which burned your eyes altogether not a good hotel 
 a tad tired looking and dark french fries like mcdonalds why not proper chunky fries ridiculous size bottles of coke
 took a while to check in 
 no public pool you had to pay 18 euro a day to use the spa also quite a way from city centre 
 there is no eating facility in the premises and the hotel menu is from a local restaurant that gouges for delivery 
 paying for the movies and not a wide selection
 although a very nice touch a welcome cookie for those of us who have a nut allergy and in this day and age plenty people do it would be nice to offer something without a nut content
 room small but nice very noisy occupants in the room above 
 our room was like a cave so dark i payed 540 for 2 nights without breakfast we need to have the lights on all the time 
 a little bit tide rooms
 all was fine
 hotel was too noisy with an open court in the middle people stayed at the bar very late and were extremely loud 
 room view could have been better hotel was not at full capacity so they could have made the effort to put us in a room with a view of canary wharf 
 the decor style is a little dated but we could certainly live with it 
 service was poor from r ception through to breakfast although the pool staff were great the staff and service not a patch on hotel arts
 no parking for guests we parked on the next road for 10 minutes just to check in so we can ask re the reserved parking we pre booked and in that 10 minutes we received a ticket on top of paying 24 a day for 4 nites thank u
 some basic elements in the room were not there but when we asked for them the staff was happy to bring them and did it rapidly and with a smile
 nothing
 breakfast not included in the hotel price
 room was tight
 room too cold stained carpet not enough uk sockets european sockets not compatible with chargers and other uk sockets not working 
 i liked everything 
 bed a bit hard
 room in basement with no window approx 5 sq m small there are seven of such rooms was not mentioned on website and or confirmation no mobile reception and no full available wlan cut off from the world some may like this 
 no towels in the room had to ask 3 times was then told towels would be sent up they weren t if you were in a hurry this would be very inconvenient room was in a labyrinth 
 avoid room 4 better room its right beside the kitchen and very noisy other than that its 10 10 
 bathroom was located down three steps off the bedroom which was tricky to negotiate in the night 
 the room doors are noisy when are closing 
 bar downstairs
 over the years of staying here i ve realised you only have a 50 chance of getting exactly the breakfast you order but i accept it now as an idiosyncrasy of the hotel this time they got it right 
 slightly disappointed that not much english tv available bbc iplayer appeared but didn t work in practice not suitable if you want to walk around in the evening or find other restaurants or entertainment nearby do that first then come back to hotel or go into town again was no problem for us as found it truly relaxing and restaurant excellent 
 a restaurant and bar
 the single beds in my twin room were not great standard single size but just not very comfortable 
 wifi signal weak
 i requested room with bathtub which i didn t get rooms vere average for 4 hotel 
 the breakfast
 the continental breakfast lacks variety there needs to be more choice especially for a highly rated hotel if you re into processed meat cut into tiny cubes and mini bread rolls it should suit you fine if you like to break fast like a king save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else the breakfast room is so small i felt like i was sitting on someone s lap and table cloth was damp we asked the lady on duty for a full english extra cost at 7 95 but food came and was a rationed toddler sized portion hotel in general needs an upgrade it looks old and dated floor boards creak our king sized bed was made up of two single beds pushed together there was a clear gap in the centre which was uncomfortable and could have been concealed better bathroom water temperature needs to be looked at my partner and i both had cold showers it s winter sort it out overall experience was very average i like a boutique hotel but this one is crying for a revamp 
 i booked two rooms with twin beds on arrival only rooms available with double bed and a camping bed rooms were small and filled with too much furniture beds were uncomfortable one of the camping beds was broken and i had it replaced there were more customers complaining at the reception lift was out of order temporarily the hotel didn t want to give the booking com extras such as late checkout 
 from the date i book the hotel they raise the cost of the room we had to argue with them to make them go to the original price
 smell in corridor outside bedroom and very noisy neighbours second night 
 nothing
 check in staff was really pushy trying to sell upgrade once we declined she became aloof and indifferent this appeared to be the way most front of the house staff interacted with hotel guests the way the hotel emphasised so much on selling upgrad also gave out an impression that they provided two tier service full if you upgrade or mediocre if you don t pity as the hotel seems to have so much potential 
 room was a bit tired and i had to move beds to avoid a switch box directly above the pillow which caused discomfort where it was sink drained only slowly and a number of repairs had been carried left decor looking shabby the room was actually an upgrade 
 at check in we were told that not only we had to pay 5 of the value city tax but also we had to leave 50 euros deposit for each night that we would take back at check out we would have liked to be informed about both in advance 
 we stayed at the hotel years ago and it did not disappoint this trip in fact it is better than we remembered 
 bed was for me to small
 quality of food in the restaurant
 for the money 350 it was an awful place tired needs redecorating not even biscuits in the room or a shower gown and slippers absolutely appalling 
 coffee m c was not good for volume coffee americano latte milky coffee
 nothing 
 the fact we booked a superior room and got an apartment room over the road and round the corner wasn t pleased as we wanted the experience in the hotel was in a room with a window but it was a skylight so that put a downer on our trip felt like we was just bunged into the worst room we was given complementary breakfast which was fine but only made it to one sitting so wasn t really bothered about having that as a sorry for putting u into our crappest room in the hotel 
 toilet floor was not cleaned properly no sleepers
 the first bad surprise is the 25 per day parking but the biggest problem was the noise coming from the elevator it was like living next to a train station that was really annoying 
 i would have been annoyed with the view given had i had to pay full price as looking into the atrium was fine for the cost and duration of my stay any longer at full price i would have not been happy 
 very poor breakfast selection and tinned fruit not acceptable not enough choice or flexibility of menu for breakfast either room only cleaned every day after 4pm not acceptable especially when i stayed there for 5 days
 2nd floor rooms are a bit too much of a climb for middle age people the reception person was cooperative to provide us with a room on 1st floor closets space is limited
 bikes ready to run you over outside 
 nothing we loved our stay here
 checking in was quite slow 
 a bit on the pricey side although is a cosy nice hotel
 bed duvet not soft
 rooms and bathrooms for the price paid could have been bigger more selection of food for breakfast will also come a long way 
 the staff i need a response for swiping my wrong credit card 
 shower was not working properly and the water was flooding the room no coffee or tea facilities in the room no ironing board no mini fridge or a safe in the room either 
 first impression from the room was definitely worse than expected from 5 star hotel photos are very improved comparing to what you get in reality the tv was maybe 15 years old not flat screen the bath doors were hard to open wifi was not working properly too crowded with tourist groups a bit far from main attractions and music halls room service was very unfriendly and pushed a lot because of 15 min late checkout 
 no reception small rooms
 i hated how unclean it was i was surprised that a seemingly nice hotel was this dirty bed cover had two huge nasty stains i couldn t touch the phone wire as it was filthy the worst was the shower head and corners i am sorry to say they were disgusting 
 cleaners start cleaning at about 8am quite noisy 
 no breakfast facilities and the restaurant was closed a reasonable alternative is the crossed keys put next to the hotel gor pub food 
 as the hotel is located in the business district most of the shops and bars are shut or close early keep this in mind when booking our room backed onto the alley at the back of the hotel which was very noisy plus the room next door had a problem with the pipes making a loud noise every time the toilet was flushed this led to a sleepless night 
 pay for towels and chair at the pool 
 this does not feel like checking into a normal hotel no customer service what so ever barely acknowledged that i was a customer standing in front of them at check in i asked to have extra pillows delivered to my room and they told me to collect them in a guest closet myself on the floor i was staying on there was nothing in the guest closet except 1 iron so that wasn t very helpful 
 the service was much below what i would expect from a hotel of this class 
 air con
 our initial room was very small and stuffy the staff accommodated my request to change rooms 
 it could have some ac in the room it had some ventilation system that did not lower the temperature well
 not enough space for clothes and coats
 a lot of loud music from disco in hotel very late into the night spoilt what was other wise an vey enjoyable stay
 no parking lot
 some of the rooms can be a little noisy and one of the lifts wasnt working 
 nothing
 drove to london but could not use the hotel car park because reservation not available parked a 10 minute walk from the hotel 
 small bathroom weird door for the toilet 
 overslept because the bed was so comfortable 
 super small room with old facilities 200 pounds more which is not valuble at all
 basic room was small but high quality and comfortable
 you ask for deposits for everything surely
 the shower wasn t fully working and the fire alarm went off at 6 12am 
 nothing 
 one of the lifts was out of action
 nothing
 this hotel took 50 extra out of my account with no authorisation from me at all they said it be paid bak within 3 to 4 days and i still haven t had it they stole money out of my account and now won t repay it i will never stop at this hotel again
 shower cold water baked dirt and detritus round bath waste control my credit card left in case went missing 
 the room was so tiny it was hard for two people to be comfortable there was no way to move around the bed so one had to crawl over the other to get in or out 
 gym
 i didn t like the way the hotel managed the payment of the several bookings we had for instance an deposit of 10 pounds that i hardly could get back also a collegue of mine stayd 2 nights and payd for three when he asked for his money back they hung up the phone 
 the bar was noisy and uncomfortable for an executive room there was no evening tidy turndown service
 nothing not to like 
 as an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways
 maids just straightened quilt ignoring crumpled sheet each day only got one change of sheets on day 5 of 7 night stay bath was never cleaned properly 
 no parking no too much stuff in the gym although you can work everything
 small room breakfast small not universal
 nothing
 not enough soft pillows
 well after i had made this booking on your website my credit card was compromised and then i had to update my information before travel with my new card details it was confirmed that the hotel had my new details when i arrived they did not and would not accept my new card they even asked to look at a bank statement obviously that wasn t going to happen on my side so we had to cancel the booking and make a new one they were less than happy with this and said they could not do anything as booking com had not sent the new information who knows but it was frustrating then we had a leak in our bathroom coming from the ceiling and the same receptionist the next morning when i went to tell them seemed to feel i did not know what a leak was and practically laughed at me so when we returned hours later the leak was still dripping and the bathroom was flooded so i called maintenance and they looked then we were moved to another room immediately not sure what she was thinking when i said water coming from the ceiling of our bathroom all in all the rest of the staff were very nice and the hotel was pretty comfortable i guess she was just an exception also a set of headphones were taken while we were out and about and when i told them at reception they said oh thank you 
 nothing
 i didn t like the way they dealt with my wife and kids i have booked two rooms for all of us via booking com however the second room was booked for me when i arrive later after them any way when they arrived the refused that one adult my wife and 3 kids can stay in one room my wife told that we have booked second room but later when i arrive any way i can understand there point and enforcement of having the second room but what i don t like the rate they give her almost double what we had form booking 446 pounds per night for one room and the room was tiny small with a very noisy sound of ac like a turbine really found this very bad as my wife was alone and arrived late and tired and they enforce her to take the room for this high price although i m staying with them almost 10 nights one room 8 nights the second room 
 the highest floor did not have elevator access so we had to take the elevator to the 5th floor and carry the luggage up it was not a huge deal and the staff offered to help if we needed but we decided to handle it ourselves 
 rooms are a little bit small but if you spend most of day outside the hotel then it is not a big problem 
 price was a bit expensive
 nothing
 booked a twin room but given a double due to lack of staff it could not be looked into until 11 00pm and then it couldn t be rectified hotel refused to accept any responsibility due to it being a booking com reservation 
 a bit more in way of toiletries n coffee tea requirements one shower gel between 2 females 
 our stay this time cost twice as much for the same amount of days as it did for our stay in august there was a funny smell in the bathroom which i think came from the sink outflow being unclean the carpet needed cleaning our tv did not work and it took 2 phone calls to get it fixed 
 loved it all 
 nothing
 milk portions in the room instead of the silver flask with milk in which although tasted ok smelt disgusting and maybe normal coffee to as a choice alongside the coffee machine option 
 dining facilities and bath could be better actually looks like they still have old fashioned water system which means it s hard to mix hot and cold water properly 
 room cleanliness a coffee cup stayed on the table for 2 days unwashed internet could not even open video on facebook air conditioning had to complaint 3 times in 24 hours to have it fixed
 too impersonal
 it s a pity that in such a good hotel i had to ask for a kettle although the coffee and mugs were supplied and that there was no hairdryer after requesting it it was faulty 
 noisy area
 the breakfast was very expensive 30 euros so i went to a cafe round the corner for breakfast 
 being woken up from a deep sleep by housekeeping walking straight in on our one chance for a lie in 
 the room was quite small and the mattress had a dip in the middle which was a bit uncomfortable the breakfast had a good selection but the hot food was rather bland in taste 
 the only thing i wasn t keen on was having to cross the road to go and have our breakfast 
 on our last night we choose to have dinner at the hotel and it was not good at all our waiter was also the chef and his english was not good not to mention it took an hour to bring us our food and it was not what we ordered this was a bit disappointing 
 little bit dirty i feel sorry about a room was not clean and cups coffeepot too 
 mini bar was never adequately stocked from beginning only 1 bathrobe provided initially had to ask for another room was poorly made up for second night mini bar not stocked no coffee pods creamer or sweeteners replaced dirty spoons left to be used again i told reception and all we got was coffee pods had to use my own milk that i purchased i felt this really is unacceptable as we paid for these extras last time we stayed here we were in a normal room with free breakfast the breakfast was so poorly managed and chaotic that this time we opted to bring our own and make use of the fridge and nespresso coffee machine however this was difficult for the reasons above the reception staff are very friendly but the housekeeping is very poor i d still recommend this place based on the cleanliness and location but be mindful and don t get the breakfast 
 no wow factor in the hotel beds not as comfy as expected not as luxurious as expected
 one of the staff not very friendly when i ask them to book for taxi they ask me to make the booking myself 
 i cannot think of anything on our last visit we asked for a river view we could not see chelsea bridge due to building work being carried out which was a huge shame as our first visit there we had a wonderful view 
 the spa does not live up to the hotel imo the treatments were good but it is small underground and not very polished this is really picking holes though as it is not a spa hotel 
 location was a little inconvenient 
 being new some of the staff were a little blue however tried and after opening several hotels myself understand how much of a task it can be my only real criticism ofrom the experience is that there were no facility to use the hob no pans etc no cleaning cloth and i wish an extra touch would have been fresh milk in the fridge i was also asked for a preauthoried deposit not unusual however could be an issue for travellers who are a little more cost conscious as it has not yet reached my account again yet almost 3 weeks on 
 the dis organised check in long queue people passing in front of the queue employees chating in the back office while the queue for check in was getting worse 
 slow wifi 
 having eaten at the hotel s restaurant a few times i would have liked there to be a children s menu too the meals available although of a good choice not desirable for small children 
 it was fine but think 3 star not 4 still a good value for money 
 cannot think of anything 
 rooms are small but for this price it was exceptional wifi is very poor and very slow small clothets but for someone who doesnt travel with two big suit cases it s ok 
 room was very closed up no windows paint in bathroom was peeling taps weren t clean and had limescale 
 the room was all ants
 the pool is in a closed room making it steemy
 n a
 they dont have parking at all it should be clear to the customer in advance
 noise from railway track banging doors kept me awake from the earlier hours next to a busy motorway very far from central
 could have tea coffee facilities in rooms
 the price of the parking 58 eur for 24 hours 
 check in took a ridiculous amount of time i have never experienced such a long drawn out process they couldn t cope at breakfast they had an offer for breakfast but the queue for tables was ridiculous i made my booking for end of october earlier in the year for 2 double rooms at check in i was told had 1 double and 1 twin bedded room when i queried saying i had requested 2 double rooms i was told that it was just a request and couldn t be guaranteed i said that surely bookings are first come first served and my booking was made much earlier in the year and surely not all the double rooms would have been reserved at that time i was told it didn t work like that i wonder then how does it work i don t think i would stay here again in a hurry if i book a double that is what i expect and do not expect to wait for 30 minutes for a table for 4 people at breakfast and the check in process that really does need to be reviewed 
 can t really criticise it
 poor d cor in bedroom no drawers in bedroom had to duck to avoid tv when moving around bed
 bathroom had some clear glass as well as some frosted glass which made it visible to others in the room a bit awkward 
 wifi was not working
 nothing 
 not much did not like 
 we were stuck in the carpark for nearly 45mins as the lift was out of use staff were helpful and polite but wasn t very nice waiting down there for so long 
 was lied to our air conditioning wasn t working and i was told that they had no more rooms and that they could bring me a fan after much persistence which a guest should not have to do they were miraculously able to get me a new room 
 nothing
 the bed is really bad mattress is thinner than my hair and you can t sleep in the middle of the bed unless you want to wake up feeling pain all over your body 
 
 low selection of breakfast 
 on the last day the main breakfast room was reserved for a larger group and although there was plenty of space to receive us in the main breakfast room we were directed to have breakfast in a smaller less comfortable room which clearly was not ideally equipped for serving breakfast service was a bit clumsy that day the other two days however breakfast was delightful and flawless 
 they didnt give me the room which i booked
 nothing to dislike just the price was high but thats amsterdam 
 our room overlooked the back of the hotel this road was very noisy long into the night early in the morning so we didn t get much sleep for the duration of our stay there were insufficient surfaces to place things in our room just one small coffee table and dressing table and no chairs for a family of three this was not enough so most of our belongings had to be stored on the floor not good the bathroom was very tiny and again no where to put your belongings i had to store my toiletries bag on top of the closed loo seat not ideal people in the room above us also made a lot of noise but this was because the floorboards creaked every time they walked around would stay again but make sure room is not on the back of the hotel 
 the sink area was next to the door to the room the toilet and shower were in a separate room and the door opened into the storage area doors also the bathroom was covered in slate and made the bathroom very dark floor in toilet area got wet when you showered 
 nothing that i can think of
 the breakfast
 don t know actually 
 construction nois 
 very small room hardly bigger then the bed in it there was no space to open the lagguages apart from the bed my biggest problem was the glass door on the bath room about 2cm distance from the walls around actualy if you sit on the toilet its 1m from your partner who lays in the bed and there is nothing between you to block the strange noise and smell 
 nothing it was a lovely stay 
 the aircon ventilation is not working properly it only worked when the card key was not in the slot which means all power is off told the reception about it they said they sent someone to fix it but it didn t work anyway 
 the only thing i did not like that i found no one at the reception when i was leaving for my flight it was 4 am and i wanted to check out before i leave and i had to try to shout to see if anyone is there the lights were turned off and all i thought receptions work 24 7 in all hotels another thing is that in our room there was a separate door and room for the toilet but the bidet was with the main bathroom next to the shower and sink that was so confusing there was no point of doing that everything else was perfect though 
 room slightly small but i ve stayed in worse
 first of all this is a 5 star hotel being so i am expecting a service typical for that category staff was not at the expected level breakfast as well this hotel is mainly for congress and meetings much less for couples service is absolutely anonymous saying that i would not rate it as a 5 star hotels indeed to my eyes this is a very good 4 hotel but definitely not a 5 one 
 there was no one to attend the baggage when we checked in and i requested for a river side view which none of the staff members attempted to find one or provide info on the non availability 
 too hot in the room no wi fi was available in a tiny room 
 waiting time for elevators is too long 
 no complaints
 
 1 distance to the city centre if you re a night owl the last tram is at midnight so it might take an uber cab to get back home should not be more than 8 euro though 
 the main bar was poorly stocked and uninviting 
 hot and humid outside set room a c to 19c but it struggled to maintain temp at 22c initially promised 2 adjacent rooms but it did not happen at check in 
 the window in my room was very draughty i needed to block it with toilet paper 
 housekeeping banging on the door at 8 20am is never good staff were a little indifferent receptionist was a robot 
 nothing
 do much odour when entering hotel pricy
 room very tired menus dirty and stained depressing outlook
 small room but this is standard for london i am not overweight but it was not easy to get in and out of the tiny shower bed mattress too soft for me free mobile phone in room but it kept lighting up and i put it under the bedside table lighting kept dimming spotlights over bed breakfast pricey went elsewhere was in basement room narrow corridors make it difficult with luggage worst thing is walls are like cardboard you can hear everything would not stay again at this price did not think it was 4 star standard shower needed cleaning around door seal otherwise clean i would personally rather have free breakfast than use of mobile phone tv 
 pillows in room were too soft only a minor detail though otherwise excellent drink at bar was very expensive 
 you need an illuminated sign on the street you are easy to miss a top sheet could not figure out the coffee maker a non skid shower deck 
 
 bad maintenance in the room we stayed in on the first night water was dropping from the ceiling ac vent and we had to sleep in a damp room with no ac
 room service late cold poor quality 
 smelly shower don t know why poorly cleaned spa no window to open and dark room inner courtyard room very little storage space 
 the staff at the reception did not welcome us nor tried to provide any extra help information the breakfast buffet was very poor especially in sweets while you would expect a great variety in chocolate sweets due to vienna s tradition one day we were treated in a very rude manner by one staff member at the breakfast it was 10 00 in the morning we had filled our plates and were about to sit to a table suddenly a lady started shouting at me in german not to sit there i asked in english what was wrong and she said tha this table was set for lunch i chose another table and she started shouting again for the same reason almost all tables were full so there werenot many choices i dont understand why the tables must be reserved for lunch so early and why the lady did not show us a free table instead of shouting
 food taste
 nothing
 the breakfast selections can be better although a 4 stars hotel they could provide sleepers and complimentary bottle of water in the room 
 the desk staff were not particularly friendly or helpful did not tell us what time breakfast was when we checked in for example we had to ask for additional pillows as they are very thin 
 breakfast on sunday was poor items ran out and not replenished 
 one of the 2 tv s in the room was not working would have been nice if it was other than all was great 
 would have liked tea making facilities in the room
 renovations going on so could be a little noisy at times 
 breakfast could include more varieties
 meal at lunchtime
 windy night the windows rattled 
 it met all of our needs so nothing
 there was a lot of noisy coming from outside and from the top room 
 nothing
 all old items in the room need to walk a lot for accessing lift and room 
 the non smoking room smelt as if someone had been smoking in there recently 
 breakfast good selection of breads pastries but cooked breakfast was cold
 broken hairdryer amenities are not replaced daily bathroom is not cleaned well rooms are small
 the hotel is rather pricey
 a 40 minute walk into town albeit quite a nice one 
 nothing
 i expected better for the money 204 just for the room for a night the curtains were hanging off and a plastic guard to an electrical socket fell off when being in plugged exposing the metal socket and the bathroom was nothing like it shown in the pictures it was extremely small 
 small rooms but probably par for london
 no restaurant only bar and breakfast when we arrived the lady at reception was very rude after walking from the train station 14ish miles away not staying here again 
 the ensuite bathroom had really cool double doors made of frosted glass unfortunately there was no lock on them and they didn t quite meet in the middle meaning zero privacy i wouldn t have liked to stay here with someone that i wasn t already entirely comfortable around on the other hand the bathroom suite itself was really nice the decor was a little outdated scuffed in places although i expect this will not be a problem when the renovation is complete we took this room at a huge discount because there were building renovation works going on having been told that the work was being carried out daily between 10am 6pm we decided that wasn t a problem as we intended to be visiting the city between those hours however we were woken up by the sounds of hammering and sawing from what sounded like the room directly above us from as early as 7am some days we were also woken up at 8am one morning by cleaners vacuuming the hallway outside our bedroom door there was another occasion when a maid walked into our room without knocking at 8 30am this made for an entirely unromantic honeymoon in fairness when we spoke to the concierge about the noise issues they were very sympathetic offered us free breakfast and some vouchers for drinks at the hotel bar as an apology lastly i wasn t sure what to expect from an expensive high end hotel having myself generally stuck to mid range or small independently owned hotels i left feeling distinctly underwhelmed although it was nice other than the view there wasn t anything else for me that set it above other places that i have stayed 
 there was not enough light in the lifts to see your floor number
 nothing 
 breakfast too expensive 
 nothing
 no air conditioning after a certain date
 breakfast choices were great but there seemed to be a lack of tables and a line of people waiting to be seated 
 the bathrooms were very dated will mildew on the marble the room was very noisy and we were woken very early by the cleaning which was persistent the room was opposite the lift so we did not get any sleep
 room was a little cramped tv and drinks cupboard at the end of the bed one had to watch ones head because there really was not enough room to walk passed the bed without hitting these it is a good job we were not very large people 
 concert cancelled
 we would like to have been warned that we needed to use the keycard to make the lifts work we were puzzled the first time we used a lift 
 the location was further than expected as we were attending a concert at o2 
 some of the bathroom fittings needed maintenance and repair but they did work 
 the roof top bar non existence don t expect nice views from your rooms either but overall i did enjoy the stay 
 the asked for deposit payment because we paid in cash which was not stated when booking was made 
 not much
 getting into the shower was a bit of a problem because of the layout
 breakfast is a bit expensive 
 too noisy and the bed is not comfortable
 checkin was not friendly i arrived around 13 30 and was chatting to receptionists about queuing for more than 3 hours at the airport they said the available room is on ground floor and when she showed me the room it was for disabled i told her i want a regular room and then she was not so friendly and said it was the only available rooms if i needed one straight away else i have to wait 30 40 min for my room where i can take a walk outside said it as my only option i don t get it when people checkout at 12 00 they could send someone from housekeeping to make the room fast that is if really none was available i was pretty sure there were available rooms moreover they could have offered me to sit and have a glass of water or coffee until my room is ready i went out and came back 40 min later when it was obvious for them that i cannot make myself walk after trip and queuing i stayed in same chain in emma bcn and in new york and they were amazing was surprised with this check in 
 there was a sewer problem outside but the smell had found its way to the room and stayed all night the internet connection was not strong enough we were placed in a room which was only just big enough to swing a cat 
 wifi is so slow 
 bathroom not a discreet room opens to lobby of room this doesn t work well when sharing with another person who is not your partner shower door not watertight flooded other areas of the room with every shower 
 just busy streets at certain times 
 very used one without much light needs restoration 
 breakfast is very expensive 
 non
 the light switches were overly complicated meant that the person in the bathroom kept being plunged into darkness 
 dasrs prettty ordinary pillows n to at great
 room was dated chair was damaged desk had ring marks from glasses carpet was tired with the exception of the concierge and check in staff the staff were surly unhelpful and when i said my milk tasted off with my tea they did not offer any replacement or money back 
 i had a late check out at 2pm but still had two different house keepers knock my door at different times after 12pm they should of been informed that i had a late check out as this was disturbing to me and my partner trying to relax 
 overpriced the garden was a little left 
 bed was uncomfortable was given 2 twin beds when i asked for a double
 the view is of an interior utility area so it wouldn t be a great room to hang out in daytime but it s a city hotel and i m sure has rooms with good city views also
 think hot breakfasts should be part of the breakfast not an extra charge
 very small bathroom
 our room was on the second floor so it was a bit difficult carrying cases as there was no lift bathroom needed a towel rail or hook as nowhere to hang used towel the mattress on the foldable bed for the third guest was extremely soft 
 bed smaller than on our first visit 
 roof restaurant service very poor very slow and food mediocre free wifi works but quite slow 
 not much room to move around when sofa beds were erected
 nothing
 nothing was bad everything was adequate provision of tea and coffee facilities in the rooms would be nice also some of the furniture needs to be repaired or replaced 
 the room service 24 hour menu is limited and overpriced other room service was great 
 the wi fi should be free for the length of the stay not just for 20 minuites
 small gym
 everything is good
 i got food poisoning with a pizza i ordered to my room from the hotel restaurante they didn t offer any assistance or compensation just filled a form with the details for an internal investigation i will not be back the room smelled like a sewer 
 bathroom was dated and needed some tlc 
 breakfast
 nothing
 noisy ground floor room next to reception
 i wish i had stay longer we were just there for one night and barcelona is a beautiful city and deserves more time to be explored 
 wifi didn t work properly and weekend staff was indifferent to getting it fixed had to complain many times
 breakfast very expensive
 bathroom was small 
 the smallest bathroom imaginable i asked the barman for a lime and soda he said that he had neither lime nor soda 
 food serve yourself how long has it been standing out wasn t clear what to do where to eat not inviting
 warning false advertising a double bed when they push two single beds together shower forces you to stand in the plughole and still miss most of the water as the shower head is fixed and pointed at the wall wish i had taken photos videos this is not even 3 star nevermind 5 
 staff could do with extra training on the check in process they tried charging both parties 100 euros more and even confused us of our deposit back we asked for the manager and after 10 minutes we got an apology they even charged us for drinks that we didn t even have but i couldn t be bothered to try and argue that point we had a meal in the restaurant an hour and a half it took for a burnt and cold pizza to arrive sent it back had to wait another half hour and then they tried charging us for the burnt pizza no apology what so ever from staff either can t pull a good pint either 
 elevators needed to be repaired maintenanced a lot quicker due to high level volume of people at hotel 
 sockets in room didn t work but resolved quickly when busy i wasn t given the service i had received previously on reception
 coffe in a bag in your room normal sachets would be fine 
 space dedicated to the wardrobe is a little small just take in consideration 
 more light switches
 reception check in was very busy and understaffed and a trainee was left to check me in on her own but she was a little slow and made a few small errors 
 no black out curtains in room so woken by light breakfast room extremely cramped and staff stretched felt it was rather overpriced 
 hard small beds
 nothing bad everything is perfect 
 shame the lift was out of order breakfast 
 to small and busy lounge was tiny
 very tiny room 
 we had a standard room the bed was small we were upgraded to an executive room on our last visit and the bed was larger also our room 291 appeared to be located next to a plant room which had a water tank which was constantly filling up the noise was significant 
 room poor quality bedding and towels could do with re newing not good enough for a 4srar hotel would not recemond this hotel 
 would have liked coffee tea in room unstaffed bar had to park a mile away
 upon check in the front desk was not very friendly
 telling me i had to pay 45 extra for better spec room when wasn t told at start
 nothing amazing service staff rooms and facilities 
 having traced her steps back carefully my girlfriend realised she had left a new hat in a bag in the room when she phoned up the following day very little attention seemed to be payed to this despite her explaining that it was an expensive hat and she was sure it had to be there i didn t like being asked to hand over my car key and told that this would be an extra 15 per night a phrase like would you like to use the hotel s car park would have made a better impression rather than being felt like i was being ordered to do so in the event i left my car directly across the road and it was just fine the next question was would i like to join your customer loyalty scheme it seemed very early to ask but given the issues with the lost hat i can see why we had to wait around 10 minutes before being able to check in as the man in front of us was engaged in a lengthy but circular argument about why he list discounts on his total package just because he has added a breakfast overall what could have been a great experience in a well appointed hotel was marred by poor staff 
 2 50 pound charge for using credit card make sure you read your email confirmation from them you have to prepay in order to avoid this surcharge even if you use your debit card at check in it appears the fee is built into the final cost 
 nothing
 breakfast could have been more healthy also i think that croissants are baked on a pan greased with pig fat so have a terrible taste i d definitely recommend sourcing from a proper french bakery or looking into how they are made as it would fit the style of the place to have top french pastry 
 the urge to go for 5 star perfection has dissapeared but the price has stayed the same breakfast is still 52 for 2 persons but if you want orange juice you have to ask every morning if it s possible to refill the staff forgets for who those 2 cappuccino are and asks everybody if they are for them even if there is a full cup in front of them on the table not one time but every morning at our previous stay in the beginning of this year there was focus service for the same 52 so the place lost his glance for us for sure when you leave on a sunday like we did then the crew is not at all at his best it s a pity 
 no where does it say you have to pay extra for the spa awful view as opposite is building however once the neighbourhood is finished it will be lovely and you don t spend your holiday looking out of a window so it didn t matter to us 
 all was good 
 nothing
 cold dining room at breakfast croissants etc should have been warm 
 no bar staff were a bit sterile far out from town quite pricey 
 the room wasn t very quiet with the noise from the street
 the bedding and bathroom were immaculate however the wooden sash windows were loose fitting and rattled so we wedged with tissues they were also really filthy on the outside masking the magnificent london skyline view from the sixth floor the kettle also had a significant leak when filled for 2 cups 
 rooms were extremely hot 
 the price of the pints in the bar ye only make the stuff across the road
 bed mattresses are old and needs to be changed
 i actually took a taxi arranged by shaftesbury staff to grand hotel paddington everything was fine except room size too small room man just too small okay for one night but not beyond
 the shower was see through from both the bathroom as well as from the bedroom 
 junior suite after taking a shower the bathroom is a swimming pool part of the bath equipment is very bad because it is simply not there we missed some things like shower cap holder for towels etc the room was good but the bathroom was not 
 husbands birthday weekend added this to the notes on the booking and that it was a surprise weekend thought it may at least have been mentioned maybe an upgrade or fruit in room or something anything nope no mention disappointed after such great views on here wasn t made to feel special or unique just another guest 
 room next to dining room so disturbed by clientele having breakfast for price would expect breakfast a bottle of water in room and hand towels and face cloths for each person 
 could do with a small fridge in the room everything thing else great 
 the mattress appeared to be ready for replacement the tv equipment and channel offering could use an upgrade 
 the price for the breakfast was moderately expensive given that a similar breakfast can be had at a nearby cafe for less than half the price at the next renovation consideration should be made to upgrade the street facing rooms to a quieter window package as is there is lots of noise from the busy street even late at night with cars and big trucks driving by 
 two things bothered me during my stay the second floor had a damp smell in the hallway and the bathtub in the room i was in had rust showing about 8 cm long on the wall side of the tub which i believe could ve been clean with a new silicon seal but was ignored 
 beds rather hard
 in dining me he was missing and bath robes too 
 i d booked a room for 2 people my fellow traveller wasn t with me due to health reasons but i hadn t informed the hotel of this however once i d checked in i d found my room was actually a single bed in a tiny room which was swelteringly hot after an uncomfortable nights sleep i went down to breakfast after upgrading to include breakfast for a whopping 15 i was greeted by the most disgusting breakfast buffet i d seen it was grubby the meat was swimming in fat all of the food was tepid i could only bring myself to have a piece of toast the original victorian fixtures and amazing wooden panelling in the foyer do not make up for the appalling stay i had 
 good all round 
 nothing
 decadent
 hotel is on the main very noisy street room and bathroom are old not renovated room is very small 
 not much only thing was that check in was a little slow but not a deal breaker 
 price and cancellation terms
 poor outdated room hilton standards unworthy will never book this hotel again 
 the room are narrow and the balcony was closed we did shared our opinion with the reception food selection was limited we suggest to have more portions for all nationalities especially muslimes there was no protein option all bork 
 1 drink 20
 the bathrooms are poorly designed when you have a shower it s virtually impossible avoiding water going over the floor of the bathroom why did the designers get is so wrong 
 front desk queuing system not clear and helpful
 the think size bed was very small and the room dirty
 the rooms are very small the hotel bar shuts at 11 30 so if your planning a nightcap drink forget it 
 requested a bath and was not given one so did not stay 
 booking com states in their advert that this hotel is only 2 2miles from central london that must be as the crow flies because by taxi it is more like 8 this completely spoilt our week end and proved very expensive nearly 75 in taxi fares 
 location was far from the city center 
 reservation was guaranteed by credit card i paid the bill in cash and after 1 month still they did not free the amount on my bank account try to pay with card if you guaranteed your reservation with credit card 
 i could not eat at the hotel restaurant at christmas holidays room service main menu could not be ordered due to time limit the price of the minibar in the room was unknown 
 as previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for london this is probably typical upgrading to a club room provides access to the club lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price 
 would have liked coffee facilities 
 unfortunately the hotel is situated above the metro line so occasionally you can hear train passing underground i have requested for my room to be changed and they put me in level 5 which was amazing so just avoid room 105 in level 1 breakfast is not worth 15 there are plenty of restaurants around for less and better street view 
 spa treatments difficult to book almost no availabilities 
 was twin single beds pushed together instead of double 
 query with bill was not handled well also booking in took ages even though i had booked on line and pre paid the fact that i had booked all 3 rooms seemed to confuse them service charges in bar outrageous
 no pool 
 15 euros seemed like a lot for breakfast plenty of other options nearby though 
 i have no complaints
 nothing
 not very good breakfast for 5 star dirty floors not very fast wifi 
 the room was quite small and noisy when people walked past you could hear them the view was of scaffolding and buildings and we were given a disabled bathroom even though this was never required
 one plug in the whole room terrible creaky stairs no room to work cold room spotty slow internet connection 
 i m tall and the bed wasn t long enough 
 noisy cleaning ladies lack of any sound proof walls i could even hear the neighbors 
 i had a hard time finding the bottle opener when i was thirsty in the middle of the night 
 i did not find room service menu and minibar was disappointing potato chips and soda nothing healthy
 the self service coffee machines at breakfast were a nightmare very noisy when they worked would be no more labour intensive to have staff pouring coffee as staff were having to help guests work the machines 
 best to get rid of those air fresheners they really don t smell nice and make people think you are trying to cover up a worse smell 
 room was very small
 liked the area very clean with plenty of activity right on the dlr for quick access beautiful surroundings also like the more generous room size 
 reception personnel
 i like thr room with a view over boulevard saint germain 
 i was disappointed that we would have had to pay 16 pounds each for breakfast on top of what we had already paid for the room we went outside for breakfast for 5 pounds each which was worthwhile 
 having to ask for an extra cup and saucer and dressing gown and slippers this did not spoil our stay 
 room wasn t very clean bathroom had dirt on floor and grubby stayed the same our whole stay
 nothing
 the glass windows of shower and wc lack of privacy can cause embarrasement at some travellers especially if they are friends and not couple 
 room 2 very small twin in basement near kitchen with 24 hour noise poor quality sliced bread at breakfast and some of bread rolls all white were stale 
 the parking was horrible at night took 30 minutes at least to find parking place 
 small rooms
 drafty window as usual in britain 
 sheet is dirty
 i was given a room in the basement and it was really noisy due to trucks driving on the road next to the hotel it felt like they were driving on you because the room was below ground 
 i booked a double room and was put in a single at first that wasn t much bigger than a shoe box i complained and was moved but shouldn t have been given a single to start with 
 the room was very very small last floor not so clean the staff is unfriendly limited parking places swimming pool was closed during our stay this is not a 4 hotel 
 noice in case rooms on front of hotel
 it would be better if the toilet is not separated from bathroom
 little bit run down
 35 minute wait to check in receptionist did not relay much or relevant information forgotten to give us water taxi tickets advise of facilities or where anywhere was located heating wasn t working so reception was freezing was 1 degree outside no heating in room quickly got moved to another hotel location far further than stated from tube stop 
 not much availability at the bar the breakfast was meant to be served till 10 30am but we got there at 10 20am and they had cleared the food 
 bit of a wait to checkout 
 window did not shut but with an old building there are going to be some character flaws 
 nothing
 the fridge in the the room although very much appreciated was a little quite noisy dated could have done with up grading to a newer quieter model just outside the hotel unfortunately out of the hotels control the area was quite litter strewn 
 they are further than 900m to the opera it was more like 1300m not a big deal but if that s your name it should be accurate the breakfast was extremely limited and not very satisfying 
 room small and rather tired
 aircon did not work no kettle in the room
 nothing 
 really confusing method for the payment they blocked the total amount before we arrive than they charge us the total amount again also the bicycle rent did the same and block 800eur for insurance which is really bad other than that every than was more than great 
 nothing comes to mind that disliked 
 breakfast too expensive 18 euro person 
 the pillows were of poor quality and quite uncomfortable 
 very far from metro station
 had to move rooms as the first one smelt really badly 
 single person rooms are really small but still are good value for money 
 nothing
 the shower glass was not sealed tight enough to prevent water from seeping onto the bathroom floor basic amenities like comb and toothbrush are not provided lack of eateries that suits the asian palate around the area 
 rooms poorly finished
 we did not find any problem in our two days stay we would love to stay here again and highly recommend it
 not bathroom door in the room swimming pool is small 
 a little bit noisy during the night
 some rooms with some without bathtub same category 
 no hair conditioner in the shower
 breakfast it was okay but only one kind of sausage no cheese 
 i wish it was an adult only hotel it is a little small to allow for the noise of screaming children through the thinnhotel walls and ruining the calm mellow music on the roof top bar pool it was be 10 in my opinion if there were no children for this reason we will not stay here again and instead look for an adults only hotel in the same area 
 not the friendliest staff at the reception 
 the continual noise from the air conditioning heating fans outside and the loud beats of music from a party evening both making it difficult to get to sleep 
 it can not be rated as 4 star hotel but as good 3 star it is a bit remote from the city center on another hand the metro is close and it is easy accessible 
 couldn t work out the air conditioning 
 not a fan of their wifi the connection was so bad that it hardly worked also it s not free unless you sign up to something when you re visiting from another country wifi is really important 
 very expensive hotel 
 staff failed to give wake up call one day and were a few minutes late on another lift out of action for full 3 days of my stay a member of staff carried my large case to my 2nd floor room but even so the staircase really a fire escape was far too steep and narrow for a76yr old man with an arthritic hip suggest another back up lift installed 
 tiny room even as a deluxe room
 service in the restaurant was mixed they seemed to have a lot of new people working there the system for breakfast seemed disorganised in particular the process for ordering eggs was not apparent on the first day and then they took a long time coming with the rest of the breakfast going cold before they arrived we thought this hotel was very overpriced in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at in london some of the staff were friendly but mostly the team were not overly friendly 
 my room was rather small 
 we don t like breakfast it is poor and dull two days of our four we went outsidd
 room service
 no restaurants nearby
 the hotel offers a rooftop bar which during the afternoon was closed and then again in the evening for a private function no problem we thought there must be a bar elsewhere in the hotel to get a cold beer yes there was a bar but it was closed 
 we would have liked the terrace bar to stay open a little later 
 the room was a little smaller than i had hoped although we managed okay the bed was a little uncomfortable as were the pillows wanted to eat in the restaurant but didn t book ahead of time not sure what advancement of booking was needed as we ordered take away every night the television was also very hard to control and lacking basic features like a television guide this meant that i had to go to every single channel individually in order to see what was on the location was also very far out of the way of anything worth visiting something to bare in mind uber s everywhere were far cheaper than taxi s although they still cost a lot compared to busses which require a hefty walk to get too 
 
 terrible climate in the room it was like a sauna despite i had open windows and turned off the heating 
 breakfast is pretty basic
 how breakfast was organised not great lack of milk on the table
 there are 3 or 4 steps to the entrance a ramp would be very nice when you come or go with a heavy bag 
 billing issues billed for breakfast when i didn t have it billed room at 75 more than booking com when confronted said software issues aircon not ok too hot gave room suitable for 4 but when i asked for a single room but better view they wanted to charge me for it close to river but away from activity and city centre metro is 10 minutes walk staff at bar seems to too busy and hence courtesy not the 1st thing you will get
 n a
 check out to early
 coordinated queueing system at reception could be implemented rather than free for all which was confusing
 compact rooms for the price you pay you d expect more luxury
 toilet and bathroom are in seperate places in the room
 nothing
 heating air conditioning seemed to have a mind of its own 
 the wifi is very bad 
 lift
 the design fixtures were dated bathroom fixtures were chipped the room and bathroom could be cleaner 
 the mini bar had just water nad one box of pringles in it the quilt cover needed ironing the cleaners were very noisy outside the room a t 8am in the mourning
 the rooms are old and the bathroom were moldy and doors wasn t easy to close and open the rooms are tiny and not much space to move around the hotel needs a major update i won t categorized as 4 stars hotel due to the cleanliness moldy bathroom of the room broken items in the room cost of the hotel is very expensive 
 waiting 10 minutes to check in whilst the front desk try and book something for another guest which the guest could have done themselves is not great after a 10 hour day at work 
 nothing
 air con did not sufficiently cool the room 
 but the staff of the night was like security nothing else they answered everything we don t know ask at the morning 
 it was not
 no complaints at all 
 breakfast was expensive 15 euro per person per day if you are looking for somewhere with a lot of nightlife restaurants close by this is not an ideal location 
 nothing really
 the beds were uncomfortable the room small and breakfast expensive the room and furniture were very worn in need of a renovation 
 i liked the hotel in general
 i live here for 2 night when i checked out my package was stolen in the live room just 3 meters agaist the reception the staff didn t do any help and obvioursly didn t want to call the police she asked us to go to the police station but there s not much time left for us to the airport and we were forienger in wien it is difficult for us to find a police station the staff did nothing about that so in my opinion this hotel totally didn t want to take any responsbility about the safety of the guest i will never promote this hotel to anyone never 
 no free wifi
 the room service menu could have been better you could choose either the japanese or a pizza place outside of the hotel that bring food 
 no value for money should hv given free breakfast
 bathroom was slightly small but clean
 city tax
 location in a seedy area restaurant staff member was arrogant and the meal over priced 17 euro for burger and chips bread which is normally complimentary was charged for and overpriced
 the a c isn t very cold at all and no pool
 the hotel charged me for the whole price of the room for the weekend on arrival and on checkout and charged me a deposit for the room without telling me 
 toilet gushing water all night
 i did not like that i used my credit card to reserve the booking but payed with a different card when i checked out only to find that i was charged twice to my card the value of 700 as a reservation deposit which i am still fighting to get refunded as you are holding on to these funds i will never stay here again 
 wifi was so slow unable to work from hotel room 
 single room was tiny and there was work being done on the wall outside the room which woke me up 2 days
 the fire alarm went off around 4 45 
 room not airy enough but fan provided is good enough to cool room down even though it s noisy when operated pillows a little uncomfortable 
 i used stay there few times they were great but now i did not like the concerige service they did not know what to recommend and they r slow i had to do my search using the internet
 room was a little smaller than expected location as quite removed 
 the room was overheated and we did not get any sleep at all even after we reported it to reception nothing was done i emailed twice once i was home to ask for an explanation and received no reply or acknowledgement from k kiren who is supposed to be the hotel manager the level of customer service is a joke once they have your money they don t want to hear of any issues 
 just one coffee per person in the room 
 no air conditioning in october 
 there s only one lift and it was out of order for the three days i was there this meant climbing four narrow flights of stairs each time i saw no sign of a repair under way it s totally out of keeping with the quality of this hotel 
 both the check in and the check out was way to slow and unefficient dinner in the restaurant was average 
 weak internet connection 
 this was my first time being blackmailed by the concierge to be fair almost all hotels have some kind of a rude staff but this staff took it to an all new level when i ordered dinner from a near by resturant the staff didn t want to bring it up to me and after explaining how that its his job he says it will get cold before it arrives to my room i went down to collect it from him he told me if i knew u already paid for it i was gonna bring it straight away i came to london for work and after along day i had to face this i payed 200 gbp a night to buy my comfort not te get insulted 
 location could be better
 breakfast buffet could be a little more creative 
 had to wait for late afternoon because our room was not available and then it was still incorrectly assigned as a double when a twin was booked another twin was then made available no supper available in the hotel on a sunday evening except room service 
 staff responses early into our stay 
 pokey room dull view entirely adequate but nothing more nice but not special 
 small tv was only thing disappointing with room 
 it was relatively expensive especially the bar prices for drinks there was a service charge which we were not informed about 
 an interesting experience just small room and outside the center if it was small room in the center or large room outside the center then ok i think this is a great place for solo travelers
 breakfast started at 7am not great for the business traveler if you have to be across town for 8am meetings i would suggest moving the start time to 6 30am 
 room decor tatty in places old fashioned furnishings 
 small and dark rooms small beds
 i was present when one of the cleaning people was washing used glasses in the sink and returning them to the counter for our additional use the glasses should have been replaced with new ones we did not use the glasses again as we were not sure whether they had ever been replaced with change of guests 
 gym is very small and limited the room would have been great for couple but a bit too tight for 4 people would have expect something more for the money paid 
 bar prices
 carpets were stained everything was a little dirty queen bed was 2 little ones side by side shower head was really low 
 nothing 
 nothing
 the shower did not work
 1 we ordered a queen room with a double bed in a quiet room we got after a lot of checking by reception a twin room they said our booking was changed from a queen room not by us 2 the breakfast is not good vale the food was just warm and the eggs looked as if they had been sitting around a while we did wait for our food 
 later checkout
 having a kettle in the room 
 expensive breakfast
 coffee machine always appeared to be out of water didn t understand why when entering room al the lights cam on and a pain to find swith to switch all off
 i booked the hotel for an artist who flew overnight from canada on her arrival she found out that the hotel was semi finished and opened only 2 weeks ago many things were not working at all or properly like wi fi which was vital for her at this time the sockets in the room the lifts and a few other things it was very wrong fro a hotel to open its doors to clients unfinished and particularly not let clients know in advance that that was the case 
 where toilet in room was situated we terrible and virtually inaccessible was embarrassed at restaurant on first morning as details had not been passed on and was refused entry
 not a good destination for a weekend all nearby bars and restaurants are closed during weekend i asked for a room on top floor which staff kindly provided us however very low water pressure in bathroom made taking a shower cold and unpleasant the walk from metro bus stop to hotel can feel long in cold winter even if not so far 
 poor value for money
 there has been a miscommunication between booking and the hotel because we ended up with 3 rooms instead of 4 and the beds were not separated like i had asked they were all queen beds except for the extra beds that were added to the rooms by the staff an hour after we arrived
 everything was great just felt like something was missing can t say what 
 the bed was too soft for my ailing back i would also have like a more comfortable chair to watch tv but the room was rather small 
 excellent
 in london should have british style service i am a francophile but the french service in london does not work not enough toiletries very expensive verybasiconce you left fancy reception and got into room coffee in room was disgusting nescaf red mug 
 no roomservice for the breakfast received this is unbelievebel for a 5 star rated hotel 
 no cotton buds hardly anything on menu for room service and nothing available
 small room short bed only uk us tv channels no free eu world channels very expensive wifi 
 hotel dirty minibar empty breakfast too expensive too many trainees at check in check out 
 nothing
 no gym and wellness very small restaurant 
 need more lifts
 nothing
 it is a bit outside the city centre 
 the facility
 the room was not well maintained old fitting and furniture there is a building site next door they stated work at 7 30 on a saturday
 the bathroom was very basic for a 4 hotel
 at one point in the night the room started to smell like cigarettes but we were never able to tell if it was from the vents or the hallway or the room next to us it was quite bothersome 
 nothing
 room was small i hate when they show you the very smallest room sloped roof low window when you first check in 
 staff should smile more 
 rooms are basic and could be renovated 
 not one thing to mention here 
 nothing 
 room was a little small and bed was also small barely enough room for the two of us to sleep on 
 could have stayed longer
 shame the did not do breakfast but that s only a minor detail as they recommended a place anyway and that was good too
 room too small 
 breakfast expensive but did not try 
 breakfast trays left in corridors overnight 10 service charge for drinks bought at bar 
 nothing 
 i was very happy with my stay 
 room was pretty noisy i probably wouldn t use again due to the amount of sirens during the night
 nothing 
 bar in hotel is closed same time as pubs by night think it has something to do with the local councils room and corridors were fairly tight in terms of space couple walking around the room even though it was well decorated and laid out 
 from map it looks like the metro station was closer enough to the hotel however it turned out it took approximately 15 to 20 minutes walking 
 little noise from the tube but not a problem no bath
 a little bit expensive but if you want to go to the big dance you have to buy a ticket 
 the only room we could get unfortunately didn t have a window which was annoying but not the end of the world and to be fair we did know that before arriving at the property 
 the room was cold despite i set the ac to 27 degrees 
 tea and coffee in room not pleasant
 they only serve scrambled eggs in breakfast you cannot order any other type of eggs and the breakfast buffet was really a bit limited when you ignore all of the sugary crap on display 
 the small worn out towels in the bathroom and breakfast 
 nothing it was all perfect we ve booked for the 3rd time now too
 earlier check in time
 in the room there was an extra single bed that we did not ask for made the room seem very small 
 the staff were all extremely helpful and polite however when short staffed they were stress was offloaded to the customers to an extent i didn t like that 
 to dark in the small rooms to much textiles 
 asked for a malibu and coke at the bar got told can only do malibu as a shot another waitress asked what would i like so i said again a malibu and coke he happily made it for me the other waitress asked them how would you price that also asked for a strawberry daiquiri and got told they didn t have any left and was making the last ones
 can t think of anything
 lack of tea making facilities would like to get out of bed on either side 
 porridge was awful it was so sloppy 
 no drainage in the shower 
 rooms are tight 
 staff at the reception were neither pleasant nor professional bed very very small room and bath tiny and interior design in reception and rooms not appealing at all 
 everything else other than location was bad additionally we had to wait for four hours to checki in
 however the way to that about 10 minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel my family and i didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security i don t recomend 
 very expensive but again paris in general is expensive wifi is terrible and does not work 80 of the times i made a complaint to the hotel but they did not fix the issue 
 a bit far from london center weird hidden charges when you order room service 
 scuff marks on wall and curtains 
 we could not work out how the air conditioner worked we were surprised that there were no dressing gowns and slippers in the executive room we had a coffee machine but no coffee capsules calling the reception was a challenge as they never answered so my husband had to go down and then wait until they finally brought us the capsules and tea cups were a bit old 
 terrace was closed during stay
 shabby rooms no services unhelpful personnel no choice at breakfast
 bed was very uncomfortable as you could feel every spring 
 it gives the impression of being grander and a bit more special than the reality the restaurant looked very unappealing and since breakfast was not included in the rate we went elsewhere reception staff were a bit cold and not especially welcoming i wasn t asked whether i agreed to add a 2 service charge but it was just added to my bill as a matter of principle i complained and got it back as i wasn t aware i had experienced any service altogether rather disappointing and the only possible justification for the price is the location 
 we were given a room that had the air conditioning unit for the hotel outside the window all you could from the window was the unit the noise was horrendous all night it sounded like there was a plane outside the window 
 the paying of the bill everything else was great
 nothing 
 breakfast was delivered late and wasn t great no iron and ironing board in room when i called for one i was told there was one in the room but there wasn t after quite a long conversation i was bought one up to my room i was also in a disabled room but wasn t told this at the time of check in if i had been i would have asked for an alternative 
 earlier check in
 novotel would not alter my booking at all even though i made several requests superior room wasn t very superior paper cups for hot drinks breakfast was an extra 22 per person 
 uncofortable pillows
 arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready ok so they had a problem won t hold that against them asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and i had upgraded to a so called club room taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny frankly if i hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre i would have found somewhere else the bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard the room was very small and there was no natural light windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area we were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but i don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller just labelling the door club room is meaningless my basic beef is that i paid extra for what i considered was a very basic room didn t have breakfast there after checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could i gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied sadly would not stay again booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience 
 breakfast room service was not great toast was not toasted sausages are cheap and forgot my fruit and beans 
 the metro station nearby was closed during the time we travelled so we had to take a bus to another metro station 
 when i booked it supposed to gave free wifi which they didn t
 maybe there could be breakfast included in the price 
 too far out of town
 the location isn t the best and we had to wait until 14 30 to get the room 
 6 eur for a small water is not acceptable
 the location was perfect for me 
 tv didn t work there were very noisy renovations going on at the time of my stay and for the price i paid i didn t really want to be deafened by drilling all day
 poor lighting in the room
 the pool has disappeared to make room for the extended spa facilities it was also the first time that i have experienced a power cut at a hotel but this was probably out of their control and after about 2 hours all was restored otherwise very little not to like 
 the room service was so expensive
 slow internet tv was broken staff were very defensive at check in desk 
 bedrooms a little small lights failed in our room on last night we got given 2 x small camping lights for the bathroom 
 norhing
 not as showing in the pcitures false advertising quer still under investigation with booking com but so far unhelpful do not book
 poor communication and follow up from housekeeping and concierge
 secondary glazing inadequate given road noise towel rail did not work even after reporting shower worked though head looked dirty and bath tap did not work as whole thing seemed locked into one position bedding had not been aired on arrival only 1 tea bag each per day no biscuits bed has seen better days and creaked at the end though we did manage to get some sleep lift is 2 person but anyone of a more rounded disposition would have to use it alone as it was very tight breakfast was suspect only skimmed milk cereals of uncertain origin and no warming plates for cooked food such as pancakes but toast was good and the room a little cramped if all the guests were there together 
 room was comfortable but tiny and not classed as a small double so dread to think how cramped they are it was too hot even with aircon on very overpriced but that is typical of london 
 the rooms were made too late even you put de sign to have the room made
 nothing
 everything was fine 
 parking bathroom had period charm but some modernisation would be more appreciated 
 lovely but expensive breakfast no priority for hotel guests on the terrace so we had to sit on the sidewalk until a group passers by finished their 1 soda until we could enjoy our pre dinner drinks 
 much further from underground than i was expecting weather was terrible so very uncomfortable
 mini bar was overly expensive should be included in the price
 building work taking place loud noise from 8am not known until check in i would have booked elsewhere if warning shown on booking com website 
 the bed was like sleeping on a sheet of plywood it s an extremely firm mattress our requests for extra pillows were ignored the requests were treated with respect just never answered or acted upon no extra blankets either there is almost zero storage for any clothing so my suitcase just had to sit on the floor there isn t even a rack for holding a suitcase so you have to crouch down to deal with it in the shower there s no place to put anything even the little bar of soap so shampoo and everything was on the floor i guess they take the minimalist design very seriously breakfast was convenient but dull with eggs that were very overcooked after sitting around for a while i don t think i would stay there again it wasn t awful just not what i would expect for the price they re banking on being a gay destination hotel 
 noisy location tiny rooms few good restaurants in the neighbourhood 
 nothing really 
 no breakfast bar restaurant but you are in the heart of covent garden where there are so many places to eat 
 size of the room
 i cannot find sth negative for the hotel 
 no fridge tiny safe some of the towels were frayed room was pretty small though that is not so unusual in paris 
 rather catch as cath can tidy room with small window and no view run of the mill food casual service 
 n a
 we didn t receive breakfast in the room or at all as it was too late by the time we realised it wasn t coming staff made up for it by treating us to a wonderful lunch in the onsite restaurant fantastic food 
 small room with a small window despite upgrade
 rooms small didnt get the twin room we booked had to take a double instead made complaint but manager never followed up every time passed by reception there was more people looking for room changes
 nothing 
 slightly uncomfortable room at least for 2 people 
 the air conditioning didn t work and the room was so hot i couldn t sleep properly
 i m not sure i like the toilet being separated from the bathroom 
 nothing
 the bathroom sinks have the most bizzare flawed design water takes ages to drain hardly a big problem but when everything else is great you notice 
 we didn t mind not having an elevator in the hotel but some people may find it difficult 
 main restaurant shut for dinner
 the room had a very old and dusty carpet our phone screen was full of dust only after a few minutes we came inside the room i advised the hotel i was allergic to dust and she said that the room i paid for all of them have carpets inside if i haven t paid in advance with no refund i would have changed straight away also the hotel was classified as a 4 stars hotel but when i called reception at 11 pm to request a blanket i was informed it was not possible to get one as the receptionist was completely alone in the hotel and he could t get the blanket i offered to get it at reception but the blanket was in a storage room he couldn t access i was cold and with allergy all night couldn t sleep and when i reported the experience to the receptionist she didn t know about the incident and didn t even apologize very poor service and room conditions it is definitely not a 4 stars hotel 
 definitely not 4 star rooms small but typical of london cleanliness could definitely improve drains smelled and rooms in need of refurbishment no lift some reception staff constantly in mobile phone and not helpful would not stay here again 
 nothing
 i stayed in a single room which was very small for a 4 star hotel the shower was also quite small there was a problem with the lights in the room not something that bothered me much though 
 bed not very confortable
 the whole setting and food
 the price of the stay was the most i have ever had to pay 
 the lighting in the sink area is extremely dark impossible to put makeup on not a lot of room to store toiletries only a small space on either side of the sink 
 my only complaint would be the air conditioning didn t work as well as i would have expected the thermostat made little impact so the room was a bit hot 
 the duvet on the bed was to thin and there weren t any additional blankets in the wardrobe we felt it was a bit late to ring housekeeping at 2 am but the pillows were lovely the bathroom was cold it was cold outside though 
 nothing
 zero issues 
 pool was freezing staff pointed to a very well used sign saying heating was being fixed but not convinced jacuzzi had frothy bubbles which were unpleasant air con didn t work which meant we had to leave the window open all night which was noisy due to it being near an airport 
 could improve signage to help locate where the spa was other than that it was great 
 our room 601 was very cold the lifts were very small and slow 
 room service is very pricey not only the cost of the food but a 5 delivery fee to the room also 
 not sure how spanish hotel ratings are provided but this hotel should be more of 3 stars at the very best the furnishings are worn out there are no carpets in the room the wooden floor are well worn and requires polarising to bring it up to a decent standard toilet seat is broken and the shower drainage is blocked had to shover in the poodle of dirty water reported to staff who got a plumber in but problem persisted throughout my stay i was very glad to leave after my 2 days stay ac centrally controlled which means presently only option in rooms are heating which you could turn off it can get pretty warm at night and your only option is to open your windows another thing to beware of is that this hotel will charge your card for full amount on booking com you cannot modify or cancel booking as you lose full amount paid for practically you are locked down to this booking so although it might say reserve there is a tiny blueprint where it clearly states this in this case it was an oversight on my part as my other bookings on booking com which states reserve only will allow free cancellation up until 24th ours before your booked date 
 breakfast too expensive a little too far from centre
 the water pressure of the taps and shower was poor 
 some rooms small
 walls could have been thicker 
 the room was great but had a funny smell that despite telling housekeeping didnt go away 
 view from room was a wall better than no window requested upper level room but given basement 15 minute walk from tube but close to overground train station 
 only thing was expecting a double deluxe room to be bigger not much room to walk around the bed 
 cleanliness a hair on a pillow
 service at the bar very poor 
 the extra camp bed for our daughter was a little uncomfortable 
 bit small rooms 
 service in piano bar very slow generally expensive
 the bathroom is a bit small
 the room is very small and i have not been allowed to check in early as the receptionist claimed that it is fully booked 
 we liked everything about this hotel the rooms were a little on the dark side more lighting otherwise perfect
 no curtains on the bathroom window so everyone could see you while you re having shower 
 no consistency in service we met another reception staff luzia who is so rude we want to extend our key according to our late check out time and she should have asked may i know your room number instead she said i could not read your room number from your key what attitude is this she should not work for hospitality industry with such a rude attitude 
 the location was little far from the city center the furniture were old
 breakfast was a little pricey 
 i chose this location based on the fantastic reviews in our room the drain in the bath did not work well we asked them to fix and there was some improvement but it was not 100 better also the carpet could have been better vacuumed daily 
 no coffee making facilities in the room
 nothing
 lift went only to 6th floor and our room was on 7th room looked much bigger on pictures provided stairway and hall upstairs felt like a house instead of hotel
 felt it was quite pricey as we were told it was a cheap rate at 139 a night which i had to pay twice as we had to amend due to circumstances outside our control
 room 1 had to fill the bath using the shower for some reason no taps on the bath room 2 temperature control on the taps didn t work so couldn t use the bath no kettle or tea coffee making facilities in room very limited tv only 1 british channel would not rate as 4 probably wouldn t stay here again 
 room seems smaller than actual size and wash stand is inside of the living area this is really uncomfortable 
 nothing
 approaching late at night from gare est via a back street brings you through quite a worrying area i would recommend sticking to the main road up lafayette approach from gare du nord would not be a problem the area around front is actually nice lively with some restaurants bars hotel itself has no restaurant
 plumbing and heating was a little bit noisy 
 nothing
 the lifts are very poor got stuck twice in the end used the back stairs which wasn t very pleasant 
 12 was too early to check out 
 paid 220 euros per night the rooms are small you get a large bed one very small cube side table one nano round table the other side wardrobe is 60 cms wide no desk no table and no chair impossible to do computer work in your room unless you sit on the bed and get knee and back ache if you stay more than 2 nights you must live out of your suitcase as there are no drawers furniture is chic and cheap the box shower room has sliding doors that do not close properly so you use towels to stop water running all over the place the pool is a tiny plunge pool and the roof terrace is very small 12 people and it is crowded it is very nice though just small because the whole building is quite narrow the safe is located above the minibar which causes it to heat so much that leaving a pad or computer inside is not recommended it gets very very hot the wellcome drink must be cava we asked for sparkling water and the lady refused just cava that was not nice since our son is 16 the wall to our room in floor 4 had ripped wall paper the wall at the end of the corridor is a gigantic mirror and your room door is right flush to it very strange odd feeling eventualy this was usefull since there are no mirrors in the room you open the door look in the mirror in the corridor and get back inside 
 the wifi speed was really disappointing in the room and in the restaurant lounge area 
 electricity sockets not enough and the one double socket available was not safe as in the plug did not fit properly and was used for lighting the room lights etc kept flickering because of this room 240
 very poor service at breakfast restasurant
 nothing
 they took a fee for the wifi in my opinion it should always be included i was going to do some work in the evenings before i went to sleep and had to pay for 24 h there s a starbucks just down the street though the air con was very loud 
 staff at reception were mostly helpful and friendly but not all and this is what matters the most when you have arrived in a city like london for the first time also we found the house brasserie pretentious and overpriced 
 when i arrived the window of the bedroom was open i was told someone had probably smoked in the bedroom but again all the staff were excellent and did their very best to resolve the issue there was also a wonderful cleaning lady 
 ground floor room but i did not mind make sure you stay on top floors as layout is bad if your more than 1 person
 room was small sized but enough for us 
 tiny room small bad and rude staff
 smaller room with narrower toilet
 not knowing how to turn thermostat off in room until the 2nd night had assumed the noise was from the room next door s extractor fan 
 nothing major shower can be a bit stronger 
 i was moved on arrival despite only booking that day apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in the hotel i moved to was further away from where i needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere i d have chosen to stay overpriced and dissatisfied 
 pool and so a were very poor and not clean at all ovetall3 10 for breakfast an asian guy who was serving tea or coffee was so rude and not happy to work the manager was so pleased to work and young lad was working with his jacket it was cold and seems so strange and not professional at all breakfast choices were excellent overall 6 10
 30 euros to upgrade to river view
 the lighting in the bathroom was a bit dim for putting on makeup
 nearly everything room was difficult to find very poor sign posted bed was too close to the wall so quite difficult to go on from my side side table was missing no breakfast as we stay over the weekend lots of shops and bars were closed on sat morning 
 the attempt to use tablets to control lights curtains and temperature was often malfunctioning and many of the hotel staff do not speak very clear intelligible english i think many of them are perhaps french nevertheless they need to upscale their attempts to be upscale and hire a few five star consulting services to show them how its done because they often fall short of the price they charge 
 a little dark inside the cupboards proper feather down pillows are needed mattress not quite as sumptuous as some hotels 
 everything was perfect if i had to find something i didn t like maybe a few more channel s on the tv would be nice 
 room was very small 
 pool too small
 i had to pay 10 extra as they said the room i booked wasn t suitable for 2 adults 1 child which clearly stated on my booking request aircon very noisy kept us awake all night it was too hot without it 
 nothing
 the hotel bar was very expensive 9 75 for a single rum and coke 
 standard room is to small for 2 people 
 plumbing sink didn t drain properly toilet was hard to flush and sometimes didn t shower difficult to get hot toaster broke
 small room noisy environment poor service poor internet room not cleaned properly every day poor handling of complaints 
 rooms very small i stayed with a friend and we were in a twin room and there wasn t much space 
 bathrooms very small
 service
 food service on friday evening when they had a big event on was poor
 nothing negative at all
 some of the bar staff did not speak english very well 
 poor bathroom arrangement design 
 we just thought that the room we were in could have been planned better to have access to both sides of the bed 
 difficult to find 
 garage not in the hotel not enough space to put your things in the bathroom
 to expensive breakfast for 25euro 
 the full breakfast did not suit my husband uncooked tomatoes smokey bacon and mushrooms 
 the room was looking the lobby i do not care about view but there was not a tiny fresh air in the room
 breakfast could have offered a lot more gluten dairy vegan choices 
 there was a mouse in the bar area when we reported this to a staff member they didn t seem very concerned and just carried on with his duties
 im been stay in 4 star hotel many times surprise this kind of hotel is 4 star is only big house with many room breakfast too expensive for 15 eur with small choice
 flat pillows
 very bad hotel they lost my pyjama the second day were very indifferent didn t even said they are sorry one of the employee attacked my boss so the police had to come will never book it again and do not reccomend it 
 reception staff seemed understaffed and had to queue for 30 minutes before we could check in 
 nothing pushed it past ok rain dripping onto window sill woke me up shower lacked pressure 
 the noise came from outside through the windows
 breakfast very poor and expensive for what you get there is nobody to help you withyour luggage
 breakfast was very disappointing not value for money eat at cafe rouge next door instead 
 as an spg member was initially allocated a very badly located room on a non spg floor if they want to promote spg should treat you accordingly arrived early in morning not allocated room until 3pm
 the view from my room looked into other rooms so we closed our curtains all times by cutting off nature lights and view of distance objects we felt boxed in for a honeymoon room they could have tried better for a better facing room 
 couldn t connect my mac to the wifi iphone ok though 
 nothing
 perhaps a kettle in the room so you can make a drink 
 bathroom had not been cleaned and still had a tub of paint and tools lying in it at the end of the stay we had someone else s bar bill charged to our room 
 it s not located at the town centre not many choices at the breakfast room 
 the food in the restaurant attached to the hotel was very poor in the evening 
 none
 limited power outlets
 we didn t have the room we had asked for that was a disappointment i had asked for a river view but we got a view of another building instead 
 bathroom needs to be renovated or at least cleaning staff should more focus on details when cleaning not sure if that would help though seems like they literally only clean floor toilet sink and bathtub but what about the dirt around tap on the walls etc it s called deep cleaning you should try 
 they ran out of beer all beer on sunday and they generally showed to have lots of types of wine but again ran out of most of these there was also a very slow service in the cafe bar on the saturday which resulted in us actually giving up and going out for a drink instead beds hurt my back
 room a little cramped smaller than expected with deco a little dated but was still a nice stay 
 small room size
 a little out of the city but easily accessible via metro train or bus
 room 1 hour late
 no parking and room service 
 a coffee machine or kettle would have been great 
 no lift
 the room was on the ground floor next to the road on the first morning we were woken by the unloading of horses carriages and people shouting on the second night it was very windy and the room was next to the flag poles and all we could hear was the flags and flag ropes banging against the flag poles 
 elevator doesn t work heating off whilst i requested ro be on cleaning personnel not good left alone with suitcase but still a 4star expensive hotel 
 standard bedrooms are dated and small no air con noisy roads need windows shut 
 location was not close enough for us booking com let us down with not being able to give us accommodation closer to the west end as requested booked 
 only adverse comment breakfast cost expensive
 wedding was on and music was so loud couldn t even sleep should have been made aware of this bur weren t told until i complained
 hottest weekend this year with no air con in the room
 it s the second time i stay in this hotel they give me a room without the window again there s non room with window remain but l ve booked the room two months ago i m very angry with it the shower is wet when i firstly enter the bathroom and it s also blocked 
 i had to change rooms as there was no mobile phone reception on the first floor the room looked a little tired 
 bed a bit hard for me
 dinner was very disappointing previous visit rated our lunch here as excellent 
 i have no complaints 
 some staff had problems understanding basic english
 the weather on our last day it never stopped raining all day but we still managed to get out and about 
 minor issues the soundproofing in my room was a little thin i could clearly hear the details of my neighbour s conference call to the usa at half past midnight no in house evening restaurant though there are many good choices very close by 
 bed and pillows weren t comfortable
 bedrooms were a little tired rooms on show were in better condition
 tv was a bit difficult
 nil 
 we had the wheel chair accessible room so the shower wasn t enclosed not really an issue just just makes for a bit of a wet bathroom 
 may something black the sewer not that comfort when have shower
 staff mediocre most of them were so immersed in their work most of the time and a smile or acknowledgement came as if out of force i had sought some tourist information from them about tour buses and they provided me with some wrong info that messed up the day location not suitable for tourists at all away from all attractions train station is a walk away but it takes less than an hour to reach anywhere by it we eventually took uber food no idea as we never ate there this hotel has no restaurant service and has justa 20 item menu which they provide at sky rocketing prices breakfast was 25 for continental spread and 30 for american spread and i thought it is better to eat at the neighbouring places menu itself was so so drab room just about ok i had signed up for a room with a pool entrance on bookings com this turned out to be a room behind the so called eating area of the hotel and when i had to draw open the curtains there were people eating outside i wouldn t even trust bookings com now on rooms toilet separate toilet and shower area acceptable in european countries but a toilet with no sink or water facilities in today s age no not acceptable 
 rooms are small however adequate 
 parking an issue though
 nothing
 smaller size double bed room smallish expensive rates but that s just london 
 the complicated room phone with no instructions the restaurant as is today should be avoided i was served items i did not order with the explanation that s what you ordered when shown the menu the waitress response was that s the same thing as what you ordered when it clearly was not and the pillows on the beds a common complaint on this site why can this hotel not use normal pillows go to any other hotel to see what a normal pillow is if you need a detailed explanation the breakfast is uninspiring even for amsterdam standards which are relatively low includes the cheap bagged tea in the breakfast bar 
 nothing we didn t like but it would be more helpful to have some instructions for the sofa bed
 small noise
 very small quirky room but it did have a view over rooftops and a window that opened wide 
 our 17 year old daughter found the sofa bed in the room very uncomfortable the room was very warm
 the room was far too hot and didn t seem to make a difference even when i turned the dial felt uncomfortable and unhealthy the food in the restaurant was adequate but i wouldn t rate it particularly 
 rooms i guess are overpriced 
 there was nothing at all 
 i was given an handicap room the badthroom was prepared for peolple with special need but didn t work for me 
 door to the bathroom didn t close completely
 hard pillows rocket lettuce with full english breakfast waitress didn t understand what gluten free was had to wait for juice glass then cereal bowl then a spoon no napkins think they were under staffed 
 everything was perfect 
 room above must have had no carpets unlike ours because we could hear furniture being moved dragged about 
 the pool was a rather cloudy which was offputting 
 selling the international adaptor is a point of question especially for guests who are staying for short period bf is repetitive not very optional 
 what s with the breakfast confusion can t british hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts it was one price if booked the day before a higher price that morning oops you re not on the list blah blah blah north american hotels have no problems dealing with this put it on your room or pay on the spot no dual pricing so easy please break the uk mode and make it easy 
 nothing
 no cooked breakfast option charge
 it s a minor concern but i found the shower hard to work out i may be the only one though 
 waiting for lift after breakfast there was a queue so i took the stairs to the fifth floor instead
 nothing
 breakfast should provide more choices
 the lifts took a long time and the concierge was never there but reception staff were very helpful and cheerful 
 bed sheet and duvet to small for bed
 we didn t really need an accessibility room there were no toiletries in the bathroom and no fridge 
 nothing to say
 the towle rail broke and fell on my foot in the bathroom
 found some staff unprofessional they asked us to pay for breakfast before we sat down even though we had already prepaid when they realised the mistake the offending staff member didn t apologise 
 small double bed expect bigger
 i have nothing negative to say from my experience at the hotel 
 breakfast mediocre to poor
 old furniture
 all the public areas were very noisy the room was rather gloomy breakfast was uninspiring and service a bit offhand had to ask twice for tea though it was practically empty all rather expensive considering 
 room was very small and traffic noisy fortunately i had my own ear plugs as those provided were inadequate my husband had surgery so we needed a taxi to get to the airport the one booked by the hotel did not arrive so they hailed one from the street that cost us a lot more room was overpriced compared to previous london accommodation 
 transport links a bit to far away but managable if you like walking as we do
 the small fold down bed was very uncomfortable you could feel the springs through the mattress not great for the price of the room didn t match the high standard of the rest of the hotel 
 small room too expensive for a room this size with no view i paid 800 euros for 5 nights 2 doors from a noisy elevator staff not forthcoming with information at check in had to ask for maps and general information no compendium in the room felt a bit lost staying there 
 couldn t see a hairdryer but didn t ask so it may have been available 
 the breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at it would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway it caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers the food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this 
 tea coffee facilities
 limited hanging space but manageable with under the bed options 
 the room was a bit small for the price and the bed comes with a very bad quality mattress i didn t sleep well both nights breakfast was good except the bread and pastries 
 small room no view for the window
 rooms were small our room was not clean when we arrived the staff were disorganized and not always helpful 
 we got a good deal because it was genius offer but normally it would be too pricey 
 very noisy due to the proximity of the highway and the bad sound insulation of the buiding
 breakfast room is a complete chaos waiters running and bumping into each other and complaining about too many tables of two when it comes to gluten free breakfast is kind of a joke 
 nothing
 n a
 in spa area there were naked guys always although it might be normal in austria i felt strange and scared to go there they charged extra for mini bar although we did not drink any better to check your invoice carefully before you sign on it 
 wifi signal poor
 nothing 
 very limited room service menu after hours also the 10 euro room service fee 
 poor breakfast so i recommend you to find a better place outside the hotel for breakfast there are several nice places nearby 
 the parking situation is bad no where to park and i had to park 10 minutes away 
 nothing
 the cleaness of a floor of my room
 restaurant being refurbished but restaurants nearby open for breakfast etc so was not a problem some of the bedding was rather threadbare which was a surprise given the quality of the rest of the furnishings 
 the room was not the one i have seen in wep side
 nothing 
 rooms were small the wifi did not work for an entire day and when it did connecting to the network took long
 the room was very small tiny even and it was very expensive for us but it had a great view and was very clean 
 the staff can be more friendly er 
 nothing
 we were disappointed that we couldn t go to the 9th floor terrace bar without prior booking which wasn t clear in advance 
 i was only there one night 
 the price the menu 
 basic services were not availble no tissues no toilet accessories we called for a box of tissues thay said ise toilet paper we asked reception to call us a cab they said u go and order 
 the web site of the hotel could use better pictures of the rooms and clearer descriptions the definition of the word double typically means two therefore a double room does not mean one room with a double bed which i learned the hard way and a bit more expense 
 lots of building work going on at present 
 no breakfast included in room rate for 214 euro expect it to be
 i suggest to inform the customers about the deposit fee at the time of booking reservation
 no plug sockets next to the bed
 there is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in october so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep air con at this time of the year is opening the windows 
 road roar was annoying greater soundproofing in the windows triple glazing would vastly improve it
 nothing
 very weak wifi can not use wifi in room
 although breakfast was so good it is expensive 20 euros 
 limited choice for breakfast
 breakfast wasnt included
 staff attitude dirty room smelling of cigarettes dirty curtains we found glasses that previous people have left asked if we could change rooms which they did however that room was even worse when we mentioned that on our departure receptionist answered don t worry we are closing down would never stay there again 
 constant difficulties with the room key on one day four different keys had to be provided my room was on the 7th floor and having to go up and down in the lift time after time was not helpful at all the cost of meals and drinks were high 3 50 for a diet coke a can elsewhere costs 65p
 nothing only used the hotel to sleep so couldn t comment on the food or other facilities
 no complaints
 distance to centre is not pedestrian friendly
 noisy bed 
 had trouble with our reservation when we arrived for 15mins not what we needed after a long journey but everything was sorted out and the rest of our stay was pleasant and without trouble
 room size very small no gym or swimming pool in the hotel expensive compared to the size of the room not good lobby
 n a
 smelly old room like 20 years old 
 it would have been nicer to have had proper bedside tables not individual ceiling spotlights above each side of the bed how on earth are you supposed to read quietly when your partner is trying to get to sleep when there is a huge bright light shining down from the ceiling or find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night without waking people up by shining a bright light directly in their face 
 finger prints are noticed on the flushing button of toilet room cleaner is expected to pay more attention to such small detail 
 nothing at all everything was amazing
 room windows don t open
 no jacuzzi in spa 
 found sock and empty mint wrapper on floor so question quality of cleaning 
 no chair to sit on in the room but the bed was great so we sat on that 
 miserable staff could have smiled and showed they cared for their customers when staying greeting at the hotel 
 too long wait at the lifts
 pool cold staff non existent in pool area nor helpful when there had to wait for our room as not ready despite confirming arrival time
 honestly couldn t find anything we didn t like
 no mirror in one of the bedrooms door to room next to public toilet noise from train tube quite noticeable as we were on the basement level
 hotel rooms very basic and tired looking 
 check in and out too long computers out of order for the second time is it really a 4 stars hotel 
 checkin process the hotel staff told that my booking had to checkin before 4 pm which we didn t see that condition earlier so they cancelled our room and we have to wait for 1 30 hrs to get the answer to access to room or not 
 if it hadn t been for booking com i d never have been able to afford this so price mainly 
 very limited equipment no wardrobes no where to have your clothes fine if you spend 1 or 2 nights no cream no slipper no cotton swab 
 small room and window whole hotel tight for a wheelchair 
 the bed is a bit hard 
 having to queue to get a table for breakfast
 the room was quit small the bed was too soft 
 food ordered via room service was not high quality steak ordered and not offered a choice of how it was cooked burger was very salty in places but bland in others 
 the booking arrangements did not work properly i was threatened with cancellation of my room booking unnecessarily 
 walking through the dinning room
 only stayed one night 
 some taxi drivers is good demand from the hotel because prices are not the same 2 worrying about it that dark corridors at night and there are no cameras in the hallways
 nothing 
 none
 could be more lighting in the room couldn t read at night
 toilets have no door latches considering the asian visitors they have to add it breakfast is boring 
 the tv didnt work that well and the ipad s whilst a great idea seem to lack flexibility in regards to control oddly 
 the room and bathroom is very small that i kept my stuff in my baggage i found a crawling insect in the bathroom 
 air conditioning unit right outside bedroom window could be heard throughout the night 
 no bad experiences
 nothing at all 
 if i was sharing with someone there really isa bit too little space and privacy
 a soap should be near to bathtube 
 no hot water several times over the stay
 hair drier came out of the ark and the hard bed 
 apparently no twin rooms with windows so we had to stay in the cellar room smelled like somebody had smoked in it sometime in the past tv screen had some technical issues everything in green and blue moving or touching the cable would cause signal issues 
 poor internet access not enough electrical sockets leak in bedroom overnight
 was w th asmall child asked for late check out given only 1 hour despite the fact that i am a regular guest
 absolutely nothing 
 mattress was uncomfortable damaged bath taps plug were also broken 
 it would have been nice if there was a complimentary bottle of water in the room the bottles of water in the mini bar were 3 80e each 
 did not like the frosted sliding door on the bathroom 
 rooms were small but we knew beforehand they would be
 the staff in the espresso caf lack some experience i e toast the bagel before putting the spread on and have butter there
 hotel was very hot a little disappointed in having to pay extra to have a view when we had already paid for a studio and when enquired about position room was told it would have a view which was why booked this type of room 
 everything was really good
 dusting needs to be done in the toilet 
 slight noise of the fans possibly from the kitchen as we were on the first floor above it 
 wifi was not working on the 2nd floor 
 if the shower has a door it will be perfect
 wifi didn t really work
 location
 everything
 when we arrived the hotel told us that our reservation is cancelled and there is no room in the hotels in amsterdam and must go to the hotel near amsterdam but we showed them the email of hotel that our booking is confirmed finally they gave us the room with extra bed 
 the rooms are a little dark and could use some additional lighting 
 heather did not work in the room bathroom small
 bit of a queue for breakfast
 awful service at breakfast in the morning food was ok but the guys taking orders and bringing it were a joke 
 the preauthorised amount taken from my debit card wasn t made clear at check in but when i asked they explained perfectly 
 nothing
 minor issues like shower water temperature wet floor when showering etc 
 there is a smell in the room probably due to history or new paintings beds are not comfortable enough 
 the rooms are really small and building is dated dilapidated my shower was missing a curtain door and they didn t refill my coffee sachets overnight 
 not so quiet room in the early morning hours street side 
 n a
 wifi is bad poor breakfast and one of staff at recepition was rude we asked for higher room it was not availble
 nothing highly recommended
 no closets rooms small
 i forgot a bottle of perfume and when i phoned to report it i was told that i must have taken it as it wasn t there when clearly it had been taken by the house staff i was told by reception to believe what i liked very disappointed 
 a bit expensive for only one person
 shower water you could burn yourself if not careful
 we would have preferred to have a room having windows opening to the outside ours overlooked the lobby and we missed having some fresh air 
 my only regret at staying at the hotel sixty two is the fact that i couldn t stay longer and by longer i mean for life if i could move in to this hotel on a permanent basis i would do so 
 very helpful staff excellent value for money 
 room was above the service area bins were being emptied at 7am don t rate buffet type breakfasts wasn t very hot
 room was very small and claustrophobic not enough wardrobe space or room to store things so room cluttered
 entrance is on second floor the sign on the street is not standing out noise from the street is an issue 
 the tea service in my room could have been better there was no milk available to have a cup of tea in the mornings before breakfast 
 coffee at breakfast was horrible reception was always smelly like dust specially near the elevator there was no kettle in the room and when i asked for team i was sent a mug not a proper tea pot 
 if anything the fact that the door to the bathroom didn t shut properly so it was a bit intimate but no worries we have been married for 49 years 
 we booked and paid for an executive room with the extra large bed but when we checked in we were directed to a room with a smaller bed after we complained we were moved to the correct room 
 no maps of vienna city provided at reception 
 chilly rooms at the beginning
 when i was tired i couldn t work out how to turn the aircon heating off as it was making a noise 
 check in was late poor management and the first impression left on us was terrible bathroom floor heating was on and could not be turned down it was 29 degrees celsius view was terrible and not what was promised no slippers or gowns were provided at this price they need to look at their customer service 
 the room is too small it was the executive and i was by myself i can t imagine this space for two it s good for one or two nights but not more 
 my room with 3bed was very small and no closet
 breakfast was too expensive
 nothing
 very slow service at bar not friendly very impersonal and aloof hot in rooms very noisy air conditioning 
 nothing
 cook breakfast looked like it had been under a heated light for days
 the room was a little tight maybe a different layout or desk type would have been better 
 having a bill for 60 dropped on table for breakfast which was not worth 3 ruined the stay
 the rooms did not have windows but drafts inquired about dvd player in the room prior to visit through booking com and the answer was that we could borrow at the reception however when asked upon arrival the reception told us that they do not have any dvd players we planned to stay in to watch dvds but we had to change our plans also the hotel staff visited our room so many times for nonrequested services refilling the mini bar fridge water supply etc i feel that they should have done those before we arrive especially refilling of the minibar and greet with complementary water once overall not really comfortable stay 
 because we travelled with a theatre trip we were not allowed to sit in the main restaurant they had 4 5 long tables seating about 12 each they were covered in empty dishes dirty plates stale food not one waitress came near the tables the whole time we were there and we had to clear a space and get our own cutlery the tea was in an earn and was cold and grey the food was cold too i have never stayed in a hotel as bad as this before for breakfast
 liked everything about the place we are frequent visitors to amsterdam and it is our hotel of choice 
 the room carpet air conditioning wasn t good
 nothing really bit of a metro ride to some key attractions but as the service is excellent not a problem 
 shower base could do with refurb as very chipped no lift to first floor where reception is though is one to other floors 
 if i had to be critical my mattress was a bit soft but i m used to a hard one 
 no shuttle
 no loby
 very thin walls we had room 3 which is the worst room possible we were woken in the middle of the night by the night guard and the receptionist talking to each other we could hear every single word i don t know if the hotel was fully booked or our room assignment had to do with our cheap booking com rate of 82 gbp but it was very poor regardless besides room service didn t do a very good job as there was an old bottle in our room upon arrival tv was very old and remote did not work due to receiver way below the bed and behind stuff you have to get up to adjust volume or change stations like said our rate was 82 sterling which the hotel in another room is maybe worth but if you have to pay the full rate you can get more bang for the buck elsewhere 
 requested a downstairs room and i know it wasn t guaranteed but we couldn t have been any higher 
 sadly important hotel functions have been missed my pillows were of such a poor quality and there were no black out curtains making my sleeping experience disappointing 
 although breakfast staff were friendly the service was poor very slow inattentive felt like a motorway cafe also not very clean
 we stayed at the hotel 4 days and 3 nights pipes are making weard whisling creaking noises when turn on hot water sometimes has very low water pressure in the shower 
 executive lounge could have been better organised with breakfast during the festive season during my stay i used it seldom but i did not once see warm snacks or unless i have a different vision of what is hot snacks
 awful breakfast cost you 10 euro no sound proof at all 
 the staff was helpful but they didn t answered 80 of ur questions about public transport or guidence or restaurants i think they have no information about london at all the breakfast is poor except the cookies 
 air conditioning didn t work we could hear all the water pipes and drinks at breakfast very slow to be sorted but just our room as friends next door had no such issues 
 the rooms should be renewed no changing rooms for sauna
 building work commencing in the morning narrow room 
 a little more space in the rooms
 communication could be better the hotel should have had a record of all correspondence between myself and the hotel and therefore checking in took longer than needed because i had to find an email detailing previous communication however the trainee was very pleasant as was her senior colleague 
 the tv
 small rooms
 breakfast was weak 
 breakfast cold
 bacon at breakfast was streaky rather than usual back and had to enquire for fried egg
 the bed and it s very old the carpet the toilet the furniture need renovation
 price
 i did not manage to operate air conditioning via provided ipad i could not even switch it off i read some other comments and i see i was not the only one so it was just too cold in the room 
 the bar prices
 the third bed in the triple room could have been more comfortable or at least better reflected in the price 
 rooms to much small
 not enough british power outlets to go round we had several chargers working for our cell phone two garmin watches and our laptop two chargers were under the suitcase bench and could only be accessed by lying down on the floor hot water ran through towel racks in the bathroom and it was adding heat to the entire suite despite air conditioning only window that opened was in the bathroom and out to the courtyard and so getting air moving was limited too settings on the thermostat a very old hotel but on the whole it was simply a treat to be staying there 
 the iced tea
 did discover that some money had gone missing from our room upon landing back in uk emailed the hotel but haven t had any reply 
 relativement bruyant
 the room was extremely small i have seen closets that are bigger could not open my suitcase unless over the bed plus the air conditioning was not working and room was extremely hot 
 the fact it stated the pool was heated when in fact it was not the rooms said sound proof yet every little noise in corridors and other rooms could be heard
 the room not very clean food terrible
 price
 other guests being rude to staff it costs nothing to say please and thank you 
 1 room was very small hardly accommodating two people not able to sit no chair or walk within room to small to get access to tea table space to squeeze in very small 2 room not cleaned after first night no excuse or apologies offer to replace towels at midnight was probably not the best response to my complain room changed at 1 am a little bigger but still very small
 typically four star hotels have bath or disposable slippers this hotel does not have any also the room has two doors the outside is locked with a key when you leave the room but when you enter does not lock and has another door from inside that locks with a latch it s a little bit i would say unsafe 
 localisation creased linen the view
 uncomfortable bed 
 i didn t like at night someone tried to enter my room but his key didn t work and in the morning i ve put don t disturb but also someone tried to open the door
 rooms were too small
 nothing i guess 
 no parking available
 no toiletries and wifi in the room
 cheese
 no parking
 staff at breakfast room was not so friendly
 not informed that the front of the hotel was undergoing building work found nail clippings under the bed when looking for the remote control curtain remote not working bit of a walk to either tube station
 room very warm but i did adjust the thermostat so maybe shouldn t complain
 slow check out
 reconstruction works across the street where was my room window was a little bit noisy 
 noise of dlr at night disturbed my sleep as it was extremely loud
 didnt like the fact that there wasnt a proper bar 
 swimming pool is dirty and some rooms have no view at all sometimes price is super expensive to stay 
 very noisy young people having party outside all night no real bathroom
 luggage mislaid upon arrival slow to get it back to us bed far to hard lifts to full had to wait 10 minutes at one point 
 our room was very small and the bathroom obviously very close to the bedroom hence very little privacy the bathroom did not have any extraction fan so the steam filled the room very quickly to the point of the walls dripping the shower was ornate but literally flooded the bathroom as there was nothing to trap the spraying shower water we had to use the bathrobes on the floor to soak up the water 
 no smile from any of staffs no umbrellas 
 very basic room thin towels no soap 
 the bathroom and toilet in the room were a bit small
 light switches in the windsor suite did not work well
 distance from main area
 to summarize our experience even though the idea and design is cool we didn t really feel welcome the main problem is staff that from the guest perspective reminds of a sect where they act as if they possess some kind of superior knowledge of things examples at breakfast an employee was explaining things in an arrogant way and loud to her new colleague she told her that if the guests are not happy with the breakfast it is their own problem as they the guests are so stupid quote that they in most cases don t even know what continental breakfast is another guest was having an argument with an employee next morning claiming that she is rude and could smile at least once the employee did not agree react in a nice manner and they had a lengthy discussion as far as we understand the concept of the hotel includes hiring long term unemployed however we felt that they literally hire anyone from the street and these specific people have been unemployed by a reason even though we liked a lot about the hotel and some of the staff at some points we had a feeling that anything can happen with you in such a place that it can burn down or sink and this is not really what you expect from a hotel you want to be able to rely on the personnel if the hotel manages changing staff policies and focuses more on democratic and inclusive style rather than pseudo hipster things such as dj in the lobby and design it will be a great place for everyone 
 matteress no spring 
 there was a mess up with rooms but a quick change slight upgrade and a bottle of wine all fine 
 when the housekeeping team came to service the room was not done properly this is the only thing that could be improved for our stay everything else was great bring peter back also 
 bit more free water one tiny bottle between 2 was a bit stingy 
 elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed 
 the reseption was not fancy at all didn t look like 4 stars hotel also from outside the hotel building was probably the ugliest in whole amsterdam the wifi was not working at all on the first evening next morning it did work though 
 nothing 
 en suite shower could have had a bit more oomth 
 no coffee making facilities in the room
 low water pressure in the shower
 we could hear the wind through the vents in our room staff are a little bit lost it was new years and they weren t completely focused at one point someone from outside threw a firework into the rotating door of the hotel the lobby was filled with smoke for about 5 minutes no one did anything about it their it system is outdated i had to run all over the hotel to print a document the staff weren t very helpful bed sheets were a little dirty house keeping didn t clean our room one day and walked in on us at around 6pm to clean the room we were out all day and were resting at the time they came in we didn t have a do not disturb sign we asked room service for it it took 45 minutes for them to bring it up the building seems to be old but well maintained
 the breakfast was way below our expectations definately not a 4 star one pastry not fresh canned fruits a bit altered and machine made coffee we were looking forward to some good italian expresso 
 more friendlier dining area 
 i found the duvet very hot 
 shower could of been less open to avoid water all over floors wifi should be from check in to check out and not expire night before check out 
 the last day we had to walk down 10 flights of stairs as there was a technical fault with the alarms
 there was a small of rubbish in the hall way on first floor all the time as we walked to our room the smell was quite off putting 
 everything had an extra charge incl gym and wifi
 uncomfortable bed having to wait for like long periods to get in a lift queuing for breakfast
 the metro was like 10min by walk and if you are planning to shop and use the metro it takes like 30 to champ elysees or madeleine or etc and when u walk back to hotel from the train station is all up the street so makes u more tired after a long day 
 the tv was broken but its okay since we re here for the beautiful city and not watching tv
 breakfast was less than average the worst in our 4 week italian trip very budget stale pastries and overall very unappealing 
 nothing
 not particularly sympathetic staff very noisy air conditioning esp on 4th floor unaided staircase right at entrance weak wifi signal
 it was all awesome 
 breakfast organisation when the usual staff where not on duty
 the carpet in room 519 was very old and dirty i guess that s why they gave us slippers 
 would reserve judgement until renovation completed
 the staff to be more friendly 
 honestly i like this hotel over all
 staff seemed really disinterested and didn t seem to realise they were supposed to be offering a service the hotel could also do with a bit of tlc furnishings were a bit worn and it didn t look like it had been refurbished since the 90 s it didn t feel like a 4 experience at all 
 in spite of being listed no currency exchange at reception available newspapers available in german only 
 could off been more choice on breakfast
 moved to another sister hotel due to water leakage problem but driver dropped me at the wrong place room too small reserved for double bed but they gave me one small single bed 
 the noise from the running engines of lorries and deliveries being made to the supermarket and offices next to the hotel was really loud and went on for most of the night night 
 not possible to turn completely off the air conditioning system they don t fill anymore the breakfast with fresh products 30 min before the end time so if you arrive 30 min before you don t have plenty of products anymore
 confusion over pre payment at check in 
 a fixed price of 25 for breakfast seemed a little excessive considering we were still full from our meal the previous evening in the aviary restaurant 
 the wifi and the lan is a disaster i wasted a lot of time because of it and had to pay a lot of money for data roaming to do my work breakfast is minimal and costs a fortune 
 12 5 service charge for the drinks in the hotel is a lot and i was appalled to hear from a number of the staff that they don t receive any of this money i asked for the service charge to be removed so that i could give them cash was advised that they couldn t do this this policy gives a very poor impression of the ethos of the hotel and it s owners and will certainly be reflected in the feedback i give to others 
 more english tv chanels
 limited options for room service
 you charged me for an adapter that i did not use 
 the bathroom was a little bit smaller than the pictures made it seem we were in room 23 but this wasn t an issue 
 breakfast and drinks too expensive
 the service was mixed bar staff needs improvement to lift service standards access to tube is ok via st james station and further victoria but a bit of a walk with cases district and circle lines give reasonable access taxi to lhr about 65 quid 
 the view and location
 the location far outside of town the wifi was so poor you can t even see the news on your device humiditystains in the ceiling paintstains on the walls electricalsockets hanging out the walls sounds going throug the walls noise comming from the a c 
 its quite noisy at night on the street side also it s quite bright at night the room is not cleaned well hairs found in the kichen area also the rubbish in the toilet is not cleaned 
 only thing the swimming pool very poor hotel by that location and 5 stars hotel to find a big pool and enjoy hotel not to go outside to spend morning time outside specially summer days have to fine good pool not like 8 floor 
 nothing
 staff and hotel do only for themselves breakfast is open at 7 it s too late for early departure guest even they cost from 5years old kid i have stayed in seaviewsuite but livingroom sofa is stained 
 the hotel rooms are too expensive as is the whole of london 
 the choise for the breakfast could be better i use to eat cottage cheese for eksempel it is not big deal but it could be nice to have 
 not so comfortable beds and broken shower
 expensive breakfast
 a bit pricey but all accommodations in amsterdam are on the higher side 
 the only thing was the strange noise coming from the air conditioning all night but everything else is great 
 the sheets on the bed had stains on them and did not look clean the tea and coffee tray was dirty and the room was very tired the bed was not comfortable 
 the room had very little natural light 
 the 25 eur breakfast price is rather expensive comparing the coffes prices in the near
 avoid at all costs strange rules and behaviors i ve never seen anywhere and i ve been to a lot of places i d have to spend too much time typing how awful my experience in this was and why i won t bore you too much though i ll just say that the little untrustworthy rude manager who took care of my check in late at night was awful beyond belief felt like a dark comedy of some sort really she even suggested at one point that i should giver her 150 pounds in cash even though i payed for the room beforehand because i used my fathers card to pay online i had to call him at 1 a m woke him up he had to turn on his laptop print some kind of sheet and fill it with personal details scan it back to the laptop send picturres of his credit card and number and sign everything or i d be sleeping in the streets with my room already paid for this was the tip of the iceberg that was my awful experience ps this is in hackney not shoreditch i don t know why they re ashamed of their location and then allow shady staff like that to manage anything plus the local drunks in the bar in the same counter as the reception loudly making fun of customers along with the staff wasn t very pleasant 
 rooms are small and sometimes noisy
 all was really great would definitely recommend the charlotte street hotel 
 very expensive food and drink no firm pillows decor was very dark no access to roof top due to facade cleaning view of adjoining offices
 price very expencive for this class of hotel extra cost for parking 20 euro each day 
 pillows could have been comfier damp on the ceiling in bathroom not enough coffee pods 
 the room could have been better
 room was dated and right next to the underground line so very noisy
 price of breakfast
 room was a bit small and there was only a shower no bath
 everything was wonderful except one little tiny thing the hairdryer he was really low 
 the pillows were too soft
 no breakfast very small rooms
 wifi not working noise some reapair work going on you have to ask for bathroom accessories 
 see above
 none
 parking
 only bad thing about our stay was that we only stayed one night wish we d done 2 
 we requested them to change to a suite on day one since rooms were very small and they did not give us one 
 some of the workers in the reception was not good in english and that is very important when you are a hotel a specially one man in the reception was not very service minded when we ask for some information help about a car pick up we had booked for the hotel the man couldn t understand english and was not very friendly when he didn t understand he just said in poorly english that no car can stop outside the hotel and we had to go to the bus station he then ignored me and then just started to help some others 
 nothing very comfortable and helpful staff
 the room was a little bit small and during the festive seasons there wasn t a lot of entertainment in the hotel 
 the only thing i think let the visit down was breakfast being shipped into the side restaurant the seating in the main breakfast area could be improved as they chairs are the most uncomfortable 
 would be better if have left luggage facility
 price is too expensive for the property the temperature of water is not stable while having shower need to pay extra fee to have internet in the room 
 no carpet slippers and toothbrush till i requested for them
 nothing 
 shabby reception area mediocre staff awful brown decor horrible mugs in room baking hot in the night couldn t get the air con to work nor open a window horrid tea bags in room cheap soap and shampoo products this is not what you expect in mayfair even on a deal all very dated and tired
 room furniture was a little lacklustre room was tiny for paying 135 this was a discount breakfast was truly appalling obviously understaffed all drinks ran out no croissants huge queue for an omelette chef under pressure we waited a long time just for a coffee and tea and when i went to wait in the queue for food and returned the coffee and tea had been taken away despite my girlfriend leaving her purse and key on the table it really was a shambles and wish i had paid a little extra for the hilton there is no excuse for running out of all juice water croissants and bread at the same time see photos i felt sorry for the f b manager but then again staff levels clearly were on the low side and inexperienced or incapable see photos not what you expect at xmas 
 no variety
 the staff at the restaurant were not too friendly or attentive 
 not realising i had access to spa and sauna before my arrival or i would have come prepared 
 nothing
 first night terrible given a no aircon room 216 and next day changed room to 877 but additional fee of gbp40 
 it smelled something when we first got into the room maybe it s the old carpet but i got used to the smell very soon 
 room lovely very comfortable bed
 very expensive front of house presented as really up market but the actual room was poor with no window small and cramped and 2nd and 3rd beds were roll out temporary and uncomfortable i paid for four beds for four adults i feel that what was advertised on line and in fotos was not accurate 
 on the pricey side even for amsterdam standards but that s something you know beforehand did t like the fact that although i had booked ahead and asked for a renovated room i was assigned a really old one on the first night and i had to complain to be transferred to a better room for the rest of my stay problem solved though very politely 
 tiny room
 there was building work taking place opposite and they started delivering very early my window backed onto street where it was all taking place
 breakfast
 check in and check out was painfully bureaucratic and it systems slow how hard can it be to check someone in and out of a hotel room was cold and adjusting the aircon made no impact a loud droning sound could be heard every now and again which made sleeping difficult 
 rooms rather small but comfortable 
 gym needs an upgrade
 small room tv didn t work
 rooms bathrooms lifts breakfast was average
 walks thin so could hear everything disturbed nights sleep
 the noise outside our window in the early hours down to replacing tram tracks but not really the hotels fault 
 the window of the inside room doesn t cover well the lights of the center
 tiny room but it is central london 
 the price for the salone week was over 2000 for 4 nights the breakfast was terrible and the room decor dated also there are no irons available in the hotel unless you pay 8 per item for ironing bit of a con 
 the room wasnt ready until 3pm whereas the international checkin time is generally 2pm 
 the bed was 2 beds pushed together you would expect a proper double bed in a luxury hotel although the first member of staff was friendly she messed up our room booking overcharged us and said we had breakfast when we didn t the next day the male receptionist was very rude said it was our mistake which it wasn t we had rung the night before and been told check out was 12 he rang at half 11 and told us check out was 11 i explained we had been told 12 and he said well it s 11 no apologies for any of there mistakes the actual room was very nice although i don t think it was upgraded as we were told but i feel the mistakes made ruined it 
 breakfast was not satisfactory compared to the price
 nothing everything was great 
 very far from the city
 room was very small bathroom bigger than the room
 staff is not so friendly 
 carpet was not clean and a bit strange smell in bathroom 
 would have rated higher if there had been a bath
 sometimes there would be knocks on the door from housekeeping and the knocks would be quite jarring when you are just relaxing in the room a soft doorbell would be more in keeping with the whole experience but i don t think there are any doorbells 
 slow service for breakfast but very friendly
 we didnt have any complaints at all 
 internet central london and i did not manage to connect once with my laptop or phone yes i know what i am doing and no the devices were not broken since this was a business trip this created quite some inconvenience i think for gbp 200 per night in a four star hilton you can and should expect more i will not go there again 
 not have ac
 2 days the elevator was not working
 no lift although to be fair we knew there wasn t one because it clearly says so in the hotel details 
 the airconditioner leaked through the ceiling on the 2nd night no one could fix the problem not even an attempt at helping out so the drips kept me up the whole night 
 the room was under the ground floor
 my room was like a box literally no space to do anything definitely not good value for money 
 staff could have been a bit friendlier and smiled
 location far from the center pool sauna area cleanness very bad 
 i didn t like the breakfast should have more variety for people who don t eat pork spa should ve been free i have never paid for spa facilities before only treatments 
 nothing i could really discern 
 extremely expensive 
 tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving the old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore and would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink 
 this was my second time at the student hotel the bed was a bid uncomfortable
 although my room had a good sea view i was on the first floor which meant people were looking in so found that i couldn t draw the curtains as much it would ve been better to be on the top floor with that kind of view also when i was checking out i realised that i had been overcharged although this was rectified very quickly i was surprised that this kind of thing could happen at a five star i don t like questioning a bill but i was glad i did as i would ve been paying for somebody else s bill 
 i booked a double room but was given a twin room was told room preference was subject to availability and blamed booking com when i said that wasn t made clear to me or that i wasn t informed that my preference wasn t available until i got there this was a little disappointing i was told i could have a double room if i was prepared to pay extra but at almost 500 euro for 2 nights i thought i was already paying enough 
 traffic around the hotel is terrible the evening was fine however the night and morning it was very noisy they started drilling in the stairwell next to our room whilst we were having a lay in 9am and it was teeth rattling loud even though i complained it continued for nearly an hour really was annoying
 the room its smal
 only one lift working to 2nd floor no stairs i am claustrophobic and always use stairs no stairs main desk staff very indifferent to my concerns over this long queues for the lift chevon was slow not enough staff on
 the rooms aren t well heated there s always a cool breeze coming from the vents and wasn t able to adjust the room temperature 
 front desk was not friendly at all 
 rooms were small for the price staff were a bit slow to deal with incoming and leaving guests
 the sink in the bathroom was clogged we had to ask 2 times to be fixed first the cleaning lady then at the reception and still it was partially done overall the room was clean but there was some dust they were out of toothpaste when we asked for one 
 i thought i d booked the holiday inn bloomsbury but got holiday inn kings cross bloomsbury although it is in fact a crown plaza hotel it was a good 10 mins walk away from where i wanted to stay i ll book hotel direct next time 
 nothing very pleased overall 
 bedroom quite small and bathroom needs refurbishing
 price shower
 i traveled so many countries with 5 star hotel but i never seen that kind of bad service hotel you can find more reasonable good quality hotels instead of this hotel 1 metro station is only 5 min distance but usually weekend is out of working 2 room was tiny and noisy we complained about that and they changed the room with more noisy and double bed we are two women and our room was twin and urine smell eventhough i spent all my parfum but that smell was continued so we had to come back to our previous room one reception guy helped us only for one luggage peevishly unkindly we had 4 luggage also when i realized i forgot my shoes in the room i called to hotel for checking 1 day later they said no shoes in the room eventhough 200 certainly i put my shoes in our room i totally can say that reception especially in charge of luggage is unkind and house keeping is quite suspisious i definitely do not recommend this hotel 
 bed sheets were not changed everyday had 8 week old baby so they did get dirty
 the breakfast for the price of 17 euros bread and croissants were the industrial kind not fresh very few fruits only two choices of not tasty cheese for france it was a let down it was a 20 minute walk to the exhibition at porte de versailles which is tiring twice a day in heels for 5 days 
 you get what you pay for if this had beena little cheaper i would have chosen the hotel previously 
 h tel not for parents with baby the lift was extremely small
 rooms sanitary could need a refurbishment
 slow service in the restaurant
 small breakfast room we had to wait in que to take a seat on sunday but other days were ok bed was a little unconformtable 
 parking
 bar prices are to my taste excessive
 the room we were allocated was 646 and it was very small definitely couldn t stay there more then one night 
 very small room there was not even space to open comfortably suitcase cleanliness of the room a lot of dust on the lamp by the bed it was impossible to regulate the temperature in the room 
 in my opinion the breakfast is very expensive for what you get 
 the rooms on that particular floor seemed to be a combination of options for non smokers and smokers unfortunately it was unpleasant to smell cigarette smoke on few occasions and probably with booking i would like to make sure this could be excluded placement of sockets to arrange ironing was more than tricky and it would be expected to have an easy access to a socket where the ironing desk is kept in the cupboard not on the other side of the room where you have to fight with space between a chair desk bed and personal belongings little practical issues also lack of bottled water per room as a part of catering we found to be under standard for this class of hotel luckily we had own arrangements to refresh ourselves after a long journey 
 the pillows were uncomfy the hotel was cold there was only 1 restaurant eating drinking establishment and the hotel was in the middle of no where and the shuttle service didn t start until 9am 
 not enough tea and milk in room
 tricky to get the shower temperature right we had to hand hold the shower head tricky when trying to wash yourself 
 no elevator but staff were more than happy to assist carrying baggage 
 having to agree to a 50 up front against any extras the room was very small and the as a result could only get into bed from one side bed too close to the window 
 a little difficult to find the breakfast was a bit bland and restaurant service in the morning a little slow
 it was very tight and small
 our room had no windows but it was a basement room so came with aircon 
 the reception staff were efficient but not very friendly unlike the cleaning lady on our floor i was concerned about security as the reception was down steps from entrance and staff did not always sit at desk the door and access to all floors was easily accessible from the road this is presumably why a voucher system operated for breakfast we had no problems though the cable tv only worked on two days 
 there was never any spaces in the car park we were attending a wedding in the hotel the tables had named places but staff would not make sure that people were sitting in the right place we had nowhere to sit due to incompetence and ended up leaving to have our meal elsewhere there were six of us in the party one of us being the father of the bride we did not return to the wedding reception as the whole thing was farcical 
 nothing
 the cleaners rearranged our towels and selection of pillows and took away the soap the receptionist when we arrived forgot to give us our breakfast tokens but they were all very friendly and helpful 
 sometimes outside noise can ruin sleeping 
 bathroom sink partially blocked room very small 
 rooms a little small but adequate
 lighting in the room
 very very dirty area unexplainable hotel almost empty almost deserted maybe it should actually close 
 bath difficult to get out of without slipping needs a mat for safety nothing to hold onto got the bruise on my thigh to prove it 
 none of the staff seemed happy to work there so there might be some issue there 
 we stay in 10th floor and 11th floor is a night club named sky lounge first you can hear loud music and people screaming all the time untill 3 00 am then if you called the staff to solve this problem they would offer you some ear plugs sounds interesting because i spend 240 euros for one night stay with ear plugs on why don t i stay on a cheap hotel which is really on top of a club for 80 euro finally the view of 10th floor is blocked by another building hence we could only see some grass on top of another building if this night only cost 80 euro i would give it a 9 0 but unfortunately they did not provide me the service that i think worth the money bad experience especially for 240 euro per night 
 room size is too small bathroom size is too small
 the rude and unhelpful staff the classic double bedroom which had a bathroom the size of a cupboard and a view of an inner courtyard which was actually a view into another bedroom 
 location isn t amazing the tram stop is very close just in front of the hotel however is takes a few good minutes to arrive to the city center the staff did not communicate with us at all we are used to be greeted when we enter or leave the hotel however the staff does not engage much our room wasn t cleaned for one day not sure why and this is ok but when we called the front desk and asked for clean towels we kind of expected the housekeeping team to bring also soaps and shampoo they brought only towels and when the room was cleaned on the following day the left the empty shampoo bottles in the shower room which is not that nice
 air con going right down at night
 food is a tad pricey 
 room was very small nowhere to sit that was quiet and we could relax bars were very noisy 
 my room was the room they give there staff it was crap tiny and right by the lift which was inconveniently loud one of the f b team laughed i got stuck in there not so funny when you pay for it though room service was not till 5am i tried at 3am and got a call at 4 30 by a guy who clearly just decided he would be nice and make me something but even that had a downside as they couldnt even give me water with it finally the cleanliness my shower was welcoming with hair still in it watermarks on the glass and the little shampoos and stuff missing if you ask me the staff housekeeping team are crap im not one to complain face to face so i hope my comment helps people make there decision 
 breakfast wasn t quite up to scratch 
 the room we stayed the first night was very cold because the wind could get in from the window
 the jacuzzi needs upgrading
 lights went in and out shower pressure is non existent 
 sound proof of the room is weak could hear neighbours talking and snoring 
 there was nothing not to like 
 not altogether convinced by layout and user friendliness of room no cover on bed for unpacking of suitcase turning light off at night turned of all power sockets eg for charging phone
 the air con the room was too hot and the room let too much light in at night
 there wasn t much room around the bed a small thing but no sanitary bags
 the room was tiny
 the room window had ill fitting double glazing that had not been repaired so drafty and heating would not work as consequence
 room is small 
 nothing
 breakfast could be better
 location not in the best area view on a white wall difficult to have warm water no coffee machine in the room good breakfast but quite expensive 29 
 the room size
 the lobby is non existence no ambiance to the hotel lobby the pillow was too soft that it gave my husband i neck ache ask for better pillows 
 staff attitude was awful certainly not of 4star standard our minifridge was broken and our room was by road works that started at 7am and went on for hours
 limited options on room service after 11pm 
 the restaurant didn t have a good variety of different food 
 expensive compared to other in same location
 the furniture in the room is a little bit old weak wi fi signal
 having the towel drying rack take up the space where you would like to have your legs when using the toilet
 position of the hotel very noisy indeed due to the main road little sleep obtained initially staff put us in a standard room instead of superior room this was rectified once we highlighted the problem food in the restaurant was appalling my daughter and i both left all of our main meals wet carpets in the bedroom not enough tea milk on the second day there were several areas of dried vomit just outside the hotel door this was offensive and should have been washed away 
 no dressing gowns in room swimming pool is too small pictures on website misleading service in hotel poor
 current renovations take a little away from the experience however i totally understand as the finished product shall be great 
 some noise due to renovation
 the fact we had to pay for parking and the security guard was very ignorant as guests we found this very off putting
 everything horrible accommodation huge nose coming to my room also hearing neighbors always and very high music
 nothing
 there wasn t anything we didn t like the only thing to make it better would be an indoor pool not likely in central barcelona 
 had a problem with the shower flooding due to a blockage
 tea making facilities in the room
 i actually decided to change my reservation about 2 hours after making it and discovered i had booked a room with no cancelation i was hoping they would be lenient but they did not allow the cancellation i feel there should be some buffer time when booking online 
 bags have been stolen and still haven t had computer and iphone back
 almost nothing
 room was absolutely boiling even after switching the radiator off and leaving the window open all night it was like sleeping in a sauna and stayed in january if it wasn t for that would have slept well as beds were lovely and very quiet
 the room was quite small and the shower stall very tight i was lucky to be slim rather book a double room 
 could have been a few more mirrors in the flat
 nothing 
 nothing
 smell in the hallway of garbage also probably just unlucky but i think we had the smallest room on the entire floor plan no room in hallway between bedroom and bathroom 
 the lifts were a real headache there s 4 of them but only one seems to work at a time trying to fit every call from each floor in at once left us stopping at the wrong floors nearly every time we got in them regardless of us inserting our key card and selecting our floor correctly
 breakfast and no iron 
 paper cups in room for coffee and measly amount of coffee milk sachets supplied in room 
 we will be contacting head office we were relocated to another hotel we were not in the room type we booked the rooms were ridiculously small and my colleague s room was not very clean 
 the service of breakfast could have been better
 internet connection was intermittent
 hammam rather than sauna as advertised supposedly superior room had a view of roof and air con unit breakfast poor for such a nice hotel
 a bit too far away from the city center the place looks not too fresh breakfasts are quite modest it would be nice to have some fish preferably famous herring and fried eggs our delux room overlooked blocks of flats and a freeway 
 the weather
 we were short of tea bags every day and a biscuit or two would have been good but honestly that is a very small complaint
 did not give a new water bottle on one of the day
 the shower water went extremely cold or hot 
 wifi
 no complaints
 price it may have been good for the area but it was too much for the tiny room and no breakfast also not good for people who have trouble with stairs no elevator i had a double and there was no room to move around there was also no room for the suitcases in the future i will stay further away and use the underground 
 the staff is absolutely not helpful so if you are looking on for decent accommodation reasonably priced and great location this is an awesome property however when it comes to staff guiding you on what to do where to go or even in room service for basics like multiplug adapters or porters for bags at time of check out etc horrible 
 we had a bad experience with the lift our card stopped working at 12 and my friend and i went in the lift seperate times and both our cards didn t work and we were stuck in the lift on our own and got worried because the lift doors didn t open so we couldn t get out we were both frightened and had to wait for someone to come and use the lift we didn t know we had to get the cards active again as we were upgraded to check out at 1pm can you let other customers know as it was a very bad experience and upsetting that was the only complaint we had otherwise we had a great time 
 sockets are too old to charge my smartphone only the one in bathroom works well 
 because of maitance they gave us lower class room than our real booked room 
 i have been placed in a room with a bed for a kid very short 
 breakfast had very little variety expected a wider selection for the brand name 
 quality of the food does not meet expectations 
 only little niggle the bedding was too hot for a lady of my time of life could have done with a sheet in the closet air con does work very well 
 cant think of anything 
 we had difficulty understanding the girl at reception who checked us in she had a really strong accent and spoke very quickly after asking her to repeat herself several times we walked away with only 50 of the information she d told us 
 nothing
 the smell in the bathrooms could be improved
 the toilets in the main hotel i have to say were disgusting 
 the room was overlooking the road so a bit noisy
 nothing
 1 the always blocking locking keys we were staying for sometime and not for the first time and they re always a big problem they randomly stop working or allow you to enter places you shouldn t be in 2 clarity and intentions of some of the staff could use an improvement this was the last trip of mine to amsterdam without the magical card 3 i wish i parted ways in a more friendly manner with the management of the hotel
 we are family of 5 we were given two separate rooms so family had to split up between the two rooms only continental breakfast and breakfast area too small area is rough tricky for someone don t know paris
 wifi was not working well
 very dated musty smell in room too many stairs no place to sit and have a cup of tea
 room cleaning service was a bit haphazard
 well as mention in wrong column some butts and a crisp packet on balcony but it was raining so i wouldnt have gone out on it anyway also i was on the 8th floor and area around lifts the wall needs painting looked quite shabby little things everyone genuinely lovely which is so much more important than paint had a great stay
 nothing
 felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped i would not of paid the price we did for the room if i had seen it before hand i feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of 3 would never use this chain of hotels again
 if this clams to be a 5 hotel i was amazed that there was no mini bar in the room and that no outgoing telephone calls could be made from the room some parts of the hotel aare showing wear and tear eg scrope marks on the wooden furniture in the rooms stains and wear marks in the busy areas of lifts and public areas it is in need of a spucing up 
 liked everything 
 the continuouslly ringing of the bells nearby my room was very far from the left and i am 55 years
 none
 if you have phobia privacy issues concerning bathing and bathroom usage or feel that you could be claustrophobic this hotel may not be for you 
 it is a huge disadvantage that the wifi is chargeable in the rooms and only free in the reception area we are in 2016 and wifi should just be availie and included 
 spa needs renovation
 tub shower never been a fan of the half shower glass walls i always get water everywhere i found the desk a little tight to the bed it was really long so it could have been a bit narrower 
 expensive for such a small room 
 none
 felt complimentary water should have been available and not part of the minibar fee paying selection 
 the prices in general were a little high for what this hotel offered but otherwise there is nothing to complain about 
 nothing
 one of the beds was very stiff and each elevator reaches only certain floors and that is frustrating
 the pool is small and shaded by about 4pm but we knew that when booking we were not disappointed 
 it is in a really ugly area of town 
 bed comfort terribly hard
 very scruffy and dirty maid service very ordinary 
 wi fi charges
 being in a room above the air conditional units
 a little bit far from the centre with a few roads to cross but definitely walkable 
 the staff are so rude totally not a 5 star treatment they didn t care about ur comfort as much as money they blocked an amount on my credit card without my authorization even though i paid everything in advice and told them to never use my credit card but they said that they calculated the room price wrong so they had to block an amount without my authorization so so so cheap and rude i ve never experienced such poor treatment in a 5 star hotel hated it never again 
 no faults
 i
 not being put in a room backing on to earl s court train station it just happened to be the hottest day of the year so you had to have the window open and the noise from the trains was relentless only managed a few hours sleep 
 avoid taking room 721 cuz it s very noisy 
 swimming pool shut on the only day we wanted to use it expensive for what you get 
 couple of mediocre experiences with staff the shuttle driver who picked us up and one checkout person was quite unfriendly 
 property is dated
 being told in advance of the easy access to the hotel via victoria station would have earned a higher rating from me arriving at victoria we got lost in the building works 
 the breakfast was very pricey at 15 euros per person per morning we wanted to have breakfast every day but couldn t afford it as it would have cost nearly as much as the room for the 5 nights cost 
 could ve have a better room service menu but it s located so near to town it doesn t matter too much 
 the room was a bit cramped and i had problem locating the power point for the laptop and the mobile phone to be charged at once
 fluctuating costs of the hotel i ve stayed here before for less and prices seem to depend on whether there is a program in ziggo and or arena
 due to a family problem we had to leave on friday so we informed the hotel when checking in we felt we could have been offered a credit to be used towards another stay 
 location could have been a bit closer to centre of amsterdam
 we had dirty towels in our room and a hair on one of the robes we ate in the restaurant and the food was a bit strange the starter wasn t what it said on the menu so i sent it back and then it came out as it should have with all the right ingredients which is quite odd wonder why they didn t give me that in the first place 
 i had requested a cot for my 8 months baby in my booking and it wasn t there when we arrived i asked the reception twice to bring it but they ignored me once and sencond time they said their maiden is off work at that time and they will bring it next day morning my baby fell down the bed the next day morning and nobody cared about that when i asked for manager he didn t want to talk to me or apologize instead he was trying to blame me for not taking care of my baby it was completely strange to me the bed in the room was at its worst condition springs out and injured my husbands leg they also told us that breakfast served until 10 30 but the second morning when i went down to restaurant at10 10 in the morning they said it is only on weekend up to 10 30 they didn t let me in altogether it was an awful experience for us and we thank god that we got out of there with no more disaster 
 there really isn t much to not like about it it is a boutique hotel so it is small but that isn t necessarily a bad thing 
 room felt very dated and a bit old the sofa bed very very uncomfortable could do with a different matteress could feel springs bathroom had mould on celing dirty in there 
 door on bathroom there was a bathroom area so shower and loo had separate doors but main door would have been preferable
 i am writing to holiday inn with my complaint s which they know about but i did not get a satisfactory answer s to my comment s
 didn t realize about your restaurant which was unfortunate as we were down to surprise my grandson on his 21st and could have had it in the hotel which would have been fabulous 
 the houseservice ladies were knocking to clean the room at 8 00 am we are on holidays really at 8 00 after that we put don t disturbe each evening not to be waken up in the morning 
 no extra plug sockets in bedroom so if the lights are off you can t charge your phone
 the toilets and the rooms too old need refurnished 
 lights and it was cold 
 the bed 
 bathroom too small
 they have to try to deal more professionally with guests
 room very basic no tv walls very thin and not soundproof heard person next door arguing and shouting
 there was no family room when i booked online the staff said i had to upgrade the room for 50 pounds per night however the extra bed is just a folding bed small and simple personally the room is not well worth the money 
 corridors but that s the nature of the excellent refit from brewery to hotel 
 i did not dislike anything friendly
 we would have liked more uk tv channels the only one available was bbc world service 
 the cards for the rooms lose their programmations problem with their system
 when i booked i requested a quiet room to find out that the room i was given had the same noise as if you were on a train platform 
 the room is small no restaurant
 the room is a bit small not enough space to move around with 2 lugguages inside the room
 view from window
 staff knowledge between restaurant and front office can be a little more aligned 
 rooms are bad
 the only drawback creaking floorboards didn t mind it much but mostly annoyed me because we had to wake up early last day and it bothered me because of other guests being awakened by them 
 small room but on ground floor so great for getting around if you have any mobility issues
 2 or 3 members of house keeping did enter our room without first knocking which we found a little unnerving yes we could have bolted the door which we did do at night but a courteous knock wouldn t have gone amiss although this was the first day so can maybe be forgiven thinking it was unoccupied 
 booked online weeks ahead and got the room at the end of the corridor tobacco smelling walls although the smoking in the room was prohibited breakfast area was always crowded and felt like a canteen with tired overworked and stressed personnel and the food was not always a grade the parking is not free it costs an additional 8 euros car night daytime parking is free however as they said it s under different management the hotel is rather hard to find if you travel by car 
 wait at check in
 small rooms and expensive 
 no hairdryer 
 there was a bag wrapped around the smoke alarm obviously the previous guests had been smoking drugs and the cleaners had not noticed this a potentially deadly hazard
 december 2016 construction sites all around the hotel 
 breakfast items were sparse by the time we got there cutlery was dirty 
 extractor fan in the bathroom was not working bathroom sink takes a long time to empty 
 the girls on the reception were not very friendly no air condition in the hottest july
 shower room needs attention 
 there was a draft coming through to the room and right over the bed where i slept it was rather uncomfortable the shower curtain in the the bath would stick to you as you had a shower they should change for glass also rooms were very small and dormitory like uninviting and bare also
 no pool and no gym or i did not found them 
 refilling tea and sugar in room every day
 nothing just the bed is little not comfortable
 they should ve been water in the room 
 my friend has claustrophobia which meant she would not use a lift this seemed to cause a problem as we had difficulty with staff trying to find suitable stair access and she had to use fire escape stairs each time
 nothing
 i hated the fact when someone took the stairs it moved the front door so i felt that someone was coming in the room i also noticed that anyone can enter the main hotel reception and access upstairs with security the reception is most times at night unattended and you don t need a key passcode to activate the lift for a 4 star hotel this is needed it made me feel unstable 
 the double bed is small the pillows are not comfy and also the bed has sharp edges and both me and my partner finished with bruises on our legs
 cost of the breakfast 
 breakfast was expensive for what it was pancakes cold and fruit mouldy
 room to small which was difficult to navigate with 2 large suitcases our room wasn t made up till about 4 30 in the afternoon even though we had been out for at least four hours earlier in the day 
 most of it
 nothing 
 room small no bath not ready on arrival at gone 2pm cleaners hoovering outside door at 8 30 am after a very late night and a do not disturb sign hanging on door 
 the bathroom window had a big blind when you open the blind you could tell that the last time they clean behind the blind was couple of years ago very dirty and moist it s a 100 150 euro hotel but when it cost you 250 euro is well overpriced for what it is i stayed there because it was just for one night and it is a 3 min walk from my meeting place 
 nothing wrong
 a c didnt work
 room was the size of a shoebox thin walls 
 nothing 
 there s no kattle and iron at my room and wifi at room is very poor signal
 na
 it was perfect
 not a thing 
 room was claustrophobic a cramped sleeping quarter 40 cm on the left of the bed 70 cm at the foot my husband and i had to make sure not to move at the same time in the room then a sort of corridor with a sofa and bathroom wc view on a concrete wall in fact the whole hotel was too small too cramped too dark one could call it a bed and breakfast without a breakfast room corridor to stuffy and hot lift miniscule not 186 euros worth i am afraid 
 n a
 airconditioning unit didn t work
 
 no parking facilities had to use a nearby multi storey car park which was expensive for the night 
 no internet available in our room
 bathroom in need of a little tlc also later room service would have been useful 
 the toilette dident flash properly owerfloating
 went to the brasserie for a drink and food order for drinks taken at table after 10 mins waite then waited another 15 mins on drinks although we could see our drinks sitting on the bar as waiters walked past them and us several times had to finally as her for them after this very poor service we went out for food the brasseri was not at all busy
 nothing
 put on search engine closest one to 02 arena it should have said it was across the water missed last cable back and had to taxi round 
 in front of the hotel there is a bar disco so in the night there might be a bit of noise so request for the rooms that are facing the other side 
 no extractor fan in the bathroom
 too service wasn t great to be honest but overall we had z great stay 
 the air conditioning heating was very noisy and there was no option to just turn it off the shower tray was very slippy we felt we got value for money as we paid 160 but noticed normal rack rate is 450 which in our opinion would be very overpriced there was really nothing special memorable about the hotel to justify that price 
 shower door leaked causing flooding of the floor with each shower 
 the room we had was kind of small i think they should keep the bigger rooms for people who stay more days the carpet needs a profesional cleaning as well as the windows in rest was clean shower is not very well thought as water goes in all bathroom sometimes to the carpet from room i mention all this as it was more than 100 euros a night i expect more you use tram number 26 to go to central station from which all important destinations start but the distance is long around 15 minutes by tram 
 nothing
 breakfast for two should never cost 45 anyway
 the wifi was quite slow at times it seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around 
 poir internet in th room
 bathroom sink and shower did not drain properly milk provided was off air con unit clicked on off very noisily all night unable to turn it off 
 uncomfortable beds
 we had rooms on the first floor pretty noisy the beds were pretty hard not super comfortable and the bed covers very thin considering the price of the rooms also watch out for the step from the bathroom area to the room in the middle of the night especially when you re jet lagged you can miss it and it ll give you quite a jolt 
 expensive breakfast and parking 
 noise from other guests
 single room tiny for an exorbitant price with breakfast not included bathtub difficult to access no space to open close the shower door wall to wall carpet a bit tired 
 one of the sockets by the bed wasn t working so had to use socket the otherside of the bedroom table but no chairs could have done with two chairs to sit on and relax 
 the air condition unit was broken it was blowing out very cold air the off switch button did not work the room was very small hence there was nowhere to hide from the constant cold blast 
 it is not 5 star 
 poor food choice
 the window had a broken lock room services staff entered our room twice while we were in the room do not disturb light was turned on
 very old fashioned decor not enough hot water throughout the day for a bath 
 did not tell me i had to pay a deposit on website so unexpected cost and hotel decor was like a brothel xxx everywhere from carpets to wallpaper down side of mirrors which is like being in your own window and a horizontal mirror running the length of bed a little strange and sleazy for a 4 hotel in my opinion only in amsterdam lol
 the room smell like cigarretes it was a family room and the room had no smoking sign on it yet it smelled very bad asked the staff about it but didnt do much 
 first of all it was so difficult to park into the garage the size of the parking was too small also the cost was 20 per day for the car charge i have a disc problem but there was no service to take my luggage to the room was my first time i traveled to many countries but it was first time for me that a 4 star hotel without a service when you want to travel your first priority that you to be comfortable the water warmer was very dirty and we couldn t make a milk for our baby the staff at the restaurant was to rude i thanks that s because when they told me that the room service will cost 7 and i told her that i will come to the restaurant even i waited for half an hour to get my bills 
 air con not working in upgrade room which actually wasn t that big therefore on cold day no warmth but maintenance guy v apologetic and he brought up additional heater straight away 
 staff goes through the hole check in procedure twice despite having already made that 1 hour ago wanted to bill my card twice for 75 euro deposit even internet in the room needs 10 euro deposit to use and they call it free of charge bad policy for such an expensive hotel 
 wi fi non existent as we were downstairs and the room a little on the small side
 the location is a far from center metro station is quite near 750 meter 8 10 min by walking at evening time nothing to do at hotel surroundings
 no kettle in room
 nothing
 room was a little small for a double
 i have to be pedantic to find any flaws but ideally i would have liked more than one small bottle of water in the fridge because it was a hot and very nice day outside also the room was a bit small but this wasn t an issue alone 
 everything was alright but the centre was a little bit far by walk it is about 30 min 
 complimentary drink tickets are only good for low priced drinks not really a complaint 
 the personal has a funny accent when talking english not always understandable for me
 it might be a little more expensive but probably because it is a 5 star hotel other than this nothing to complain about 
 it was a comfortable clean room we had a triple room travelling with my young son and the 3rd bed was not as comfortable as the two twins that were pushed together to form a double 
 check in was slow 
 the frosted glass on the bathroom door 
 very disappointed in the wi fi connection while receiving sending emails was no problem backing up to icloud took forever to the point that it was useless 
 it s a bit pricy compared to it s value
 nothing
 no internal stairs my daughter doesn t go in lifts so although it wasn t a problem going down as she could access the barred door from the inside every time we returned to the hotel i had to go to the concierge to ask him to let her in whilst she waited outside the concierges were without exception very obliging but it was inconvenient 
 breakfast
 was near main street noisy and there was some insect location was very far from downtown and far from all other fun not good with young children
 my room was on the small side and no view tro speak of 
 would have expected for minibar to be complementary with executive room but that was not the case 
 the only thing i can mention in here is the parking fee which was pretty high 55 euros a day but we were aware of that from the begging and still decided to stay here 
 rooms are incredibly small and i supposedly got an upgrade to a superior room even though it was claustrophobic the lift was out of order during my entire stay as they were changing the lift so staying on the 4th floor was not exactly pleasant 
 if your e looking to have an easy time with wifi thermostat i e modern amenities etc this is not the place for you i was put in a lovely pretty room but it was in the basement never even thought to ask not to be put in a basement bc didn t know hotels had rooms here which was on the cold side and i then discovered there was no way to adjust the thermostat other than to put on a space heater i e no a c in this hotel and rooms can vary be stuffy or too cold staff was helpful and attempted to move my room but the next room was worse too hot also wifi in the basement was not reliable and this was frustrating as was the dark view outside i was initially moved to another room upstairs at my request which was stuffy temperature wise and the lack of a c was a problem also the locks on the doors are not easy to maneuver old locks and keys which are cute but i got stuck in one of the first rooms i was given bc the door was old and broken 
 the breakfast
 no wifi
 would have liked some more indoor seating sofas 
 breakfast was only luke warm on both mornings we were there 
 charged for an extra room and then not issued a refund straight away very poorly dealt with by management who left me waiting for a long time only to tell me they couldn t do it for me very poor customer service 
 the front desk staff was rude as there was a problem wth my bookings i had booked a non refundable rate for 7 nights but aftr checking in i didnt find the hotel worth staying so i wanted to check out and they refused to refund the money paid on my credit card 
 didn t get a view expected abit more for what i paid the door kept squeaking all night so couldn t get a good sleep
 unfortunality on christmastime there was a irland group clients very bad behavier and very disturbing impossible to be in the bar aerea
 the breakfast was disappointing there should be more varieties and it is a bit expensive
 no issues
 they pre authorized one night fee two days before arrival 
 the rooms are discribed as sound proof they aren t
 my room was not available until 16 00 mini bar was completely empty and front desk staff not very helpful 
 the bathroom decor was tired with cracked floor tiles peeling paint no heater or mechanical extraction in the bathroom either so freezing and very steamy after shower the large window by the bed was very draughty and not very well sound proofed 
 room right by air unit very noisy and virtually no natural light in the room
 there are sleeping issues which is unfortunate for a hotel the pillow was too thin but wide enough to double fold it and then it turned out fine the mattress is completely covered with some plastic cover which is a sin as this prevents nightly sweating to be taken care of a plastic protection cover is fine but then let guests sleep on a thick molton sheet below the normal linen sheet i wrapped myself in the duvet by this one too double folding it it was wide enough for a single sleeper to do this but two people would have had a problem by the way the duvet did not fully cover the mattress so even without the sweating issue two people would have had a problem covering themselves unless house keeping provides an additional one two minor points the room s key card did not always function immediately when removing the card from the holder the lights went out immediately a time delay of a few seconds would not leave the guest in complete darkness while still in the room i was glad to have been able to cope with the sleeping issues as i did not want to prematurely leave this otherwise excellent hotel 
 the coridor to the room looked old
 pillows too soft along with most other hotels hairdryer very difficult to use not near mirror and coiled lead means you can hardly pull it up to head height very annoying 
 beds where only a small double size and only 1 dressing gown in the room 
 cheap coffee in room
 paid total amount in advance before check in including for break fast coupons but family was sent back in room by lady at breakfast reception desk saying your payment is not in hotel record had to see hotel manager to solve to problem of breakfast coupons 
 absolutely nothing 
 walls v thin could hear everything happening in rooms adjacent and above no coffee tea facilities in room wardobe insufficient due to safe taking up space bathroom toiletries only shower gel breakfast overpriced for a very basic selection was very surprised this is classed as a 4 star maybe superior rooms are better value but generally this was an expensive stay for such a basic hotel 
 the room was excellent but the bed mattress for me did not have enough comfort layers above the very firm springs first night was not good but for the second night i put the duvee above the mattress and slept on the duvee with dressing gown and blanket over me much more comfortable and slept well 
 1 the attitude of the staff except for the concierge sucks major they are all argumentative unhelpful and aggressive in their stance against you i found it a real turn off 2 the air conditioning in the room sucked in spite of having it on fan speed 3 and 18c degrees the room was always warm the a c is just old and decrepit it is totally unable to cool down a room 3 rooms were not ready when promised at all in spite of arriving early and the sour faced russian woman on the front desk pointedly commenting that check in time was 2 pm the rooms were not ready until 2 30 pm 4 one room was supposed to have a double bed they gave us a king they promised to separate the king into two beds never did 5 the second room was supposed to be a king they gave us a queeen promised to find us another room never did 6 the hotel is really far away from the tube 7 paid wifi in this day and era this millenium is a sad sad hotel nothing compared to the one in ny which is amazing i am never going to stay in it again total waste of money 
 do they realise that in the pool changing rooms the curtains are white and you can see everthing through them can be very embarrassing when people are changing
 wifi was down for most of my stay breakfast was ok but i expected something a bit better better coffee more choice better cooked products 
 no mini bar and safe did not work
 separate male and female sauna and steam room and the expensive price of 24 00 pp for breakfast
 everything the room was tired and needing a facelift long ago the reception system is out of date the breakfast looked very lack lusture and with a huge play on gross profit achievement the hilton olympia was like a typical budget hotel 
 i struggle to come up with anything 
 nothing
 pillows not comfortable no air conditioning only able to open a window to cool the room and therefore noise from outside 
 going downstairs could have had better handrails on 
 a small room with a view of a brick wall very claustrophobic no mini tubes toothpaste 
 when i paid for my reservation they could not locate the money for at least 2 weeks which caused me stress and inconvenience the rest of the aspects were great though 
 the staff didn t understand english at all and one lady just started working there had no support from colleagues no knowledge of surrounding area
 nothing
 a bit expensive room was at 1st floor so eiffel view was available only from balcony with some athletic moves there were lack of cheese at the breakfast as a turkish couple we can not live without cheese 
 complimentary breakfast was a big letdown no live cooking stations
 the restaurant needs improving we were going to have dinner at the hotel but it was too small and choices limited ended up dining in a local restaurant outside the hotel parking should be free for guests we were charged 15 
 the restaurant was closed for summer break 
 odd shower configuration wifi had to sign in each day safe on the floor 
 the facilities were not even close on par with a 5 star hotel the room was dated with broken shower parts torn lamp shades and curtains with holes in them on top of that the spa was closed and it was a bank holiday weekend when it surely would be their busiest time 
 rooms adequate if maybe a bit small drinks very expensive 21 for breakfast 
 i wished i could have stayed longer 
 pillows were too soft 
 nothing even though they do not have a restaurant there is a meal service in the bar 
 no gym facilities lobby is too small 
 terrible beds really bad back ache never had in a hotel before insane prices in restaurant which why restaurant empty all the time totally stupid unacceptable waste of prime space even staff agree it is ludicrous charge for car park come on
 i booked a double bed as we are in couple but they didn t take it in account and gave us two simple bed 
 lighting for bathroom glass window door shines light at bedside disrupting sleep when someone uses bathroom no separate light in toilet room 
 breakfast was way too expensive 23 euros per person 
 its a nice hotel but not a 4 star as promoted with plastic glasses which are usually broken
 i was given a junior suite that was too small for my sister and i
 wish we didn t have to sign in to wifi every time we returned to the hotel 
 staff unhelpful
 view if the air conditioning unit in room 254 
 outside appearance looks like a run down car park breakfast was expensive compared to what you can buy for half the price in the restaurant around the corner
 my only disappointment is that we had to leave so soon i would have enjoyed staying a couple of more days 
 could have had a proper hairdryer rather than a classic hotel bathroom machine but probably not an issue for most people 
 loud music sunday morning in the fitness and business lounch
 although room service is offered this was mainly sushi so not a great choice for kids or essentials
 except the tv was a pain to use and the picture kept breaking up pixelating digital breakup this didnt really affect our stay fortunately but it really would have if we had wanted to watch tv 
 the room was in the basement which i didn t mind but 2 ceiling lights didn t work and the bedside lights didn t work heating didn t appear to work on the saturday and sunday the bathroom stunk of raw sewage and made the stay unpleasant i wasn t even asked by staff how my stay was when i left
 only the person who came in at 4am next door banging crashing must have been a good night 
 always small a little tight for 2 people
 breakfast menu was okay a bit busy due to the london marathon
 i know that hotels in london usually have small rooms but my room was more like a cabin on a small boat they compensated this with an extra small bed i am 6 3 and the both my feet were hanging out of the bed the bed felt more like and extra bed it was very hard and my shoulders streched pretty much all across it one of the windows had a crack all across it and the slightest wind made it slam all night there was abolutely no pressure in the shower so soap and shampoo took forever to get off i mentioned this when checking out but not really any response was given i am sure that they have nice rooms aswell but considering such a price at a in general nice chain this was way under my expectations 
 the house keeping staff member who attended our room could have been a little friendlier and shown a bit more patience when we returned to use the toilet 
 the rooms are very dark made worse by the decor it cried out for some brighter colours there also does not seem enough investment on the cleaning staff who work single handed and struggle to get the cleaning done our room was cleaned last every day and this was not until 6 pm on most days which was inconvenient when getting ready to go out 
 some of the staff at front desk do not speak english the wellness area is tiny and messy and not really clean really not worth to book it with the room we booked a suite with spa and these do not have beach view so its not worth neither the breakfast buffet ihas a good selection if food but its also not really clean probably due to the mass of people having breakfast at the same time finally better not to forget any items when leaving the hotel one month after our stay we are still waiting that the hotel returns the item we forgot in our room lets hope 
 parking is offsite but very close by and readily available on the weekend we stayed 
 low temperature in the room
 everything was great
 a bit of a challenge to regulate the room temperature 
 the parking was a rip off it was below your hotel and yet your guest had to pay a lot of money to park and to top it all the meters did not work properly due to the parking i would not stay at your hotel again
 non 
 the only person who spoke passable english was the doorman the lady who greeted us at the reception was not only incredibly rude but also very unhelpful and at times hard to understand the chap who showed us to our room while very nice also did not speak a lot of english the complimentary fruit basket consisted of one pear the staff member who showed us to our room remarked upon this fact with pronounced embarrassment and promised to have it refilled immediately sadly this solitary pear was with us for the entire duration of our three day stay it never received any fruity or other companions the complimentary bottles of mineral water were non existent both of these water and fruit were advertised to us on numerous occasions however we never actually had the pleasure of enjoying either of them repeated complaints to various staff members achieved nothing all in all it was not a horrible experience but one that could have been had at a much cheaper hotel with much less disappointment after all if you stay in a five star hotel you expect a certain something and that was most assuredly lacking 
 the edge of the shower is dirty same for behind the sink very dirty the towels did not smell good when you get out of your room the cleaning staff leave a total mess in front of your door so that it was complicate reaching the elevator 
 we like take bus but here only bus 24 a little bit unconvinced 
 nothing
 things look old inside the room even with surface makeup too many carpets make the air with smell whick is not fresh not healthy 
 i was really happy with my stay but if i were being picky i d say objects in the room like the hairdryer could have been a bit cleaner breakfast could have been better not a huge choice of fruit tea very stewed not a great bread selection i think guests expect a better these days but they did provide mineral water and normal sized glasses so that was a plus and breakast room was incredibly hot 
 we were in the new wing which is a new building across the street so even for breakfast we had to get jackets etc as it was cold and raining december 
 not much located within walking distance of the hotel 
 fairly pricey for one night but it is london camden is a noisy place and someone set the fire alarm off at 7am 
 airless room with sealed windows very limited eating facilities i ordered a salad at the bar which turned out to be six bits of beetroot and a small chunk of cheese for 10 plus service service should be at the discretion of the customer not compulsory one small bottle of complimentary mineral water in the room between two people sauna purported to be 24 hours but wasn t on when i arrived at 4pm no staff in sight managed to find a porter who helped me to turn the sauna on and then came out to a luke warm shower 
 nothing 
 glass door to bathroom allowed little privacy front office staff was a bit rude at times
 got the smallest room i have ever stayed in at any hotel was nice and clean but very tiny 
 there was road works and building going on and i feel we should have been hold when we booked the hotel
 no hot water and room was very dated and small
 breakfast there were quality issues with the cooked breakfast which was served twice lukewarm which was unappetizing although our waitress sincerely apologised and took our room number as a record on departure we were charged full price as this information had not been passed on to reception staff however the rest of the breakfast buffet was of good quality with a reasonable range of choice service was prompt 
 at checking in they are blocking too big sum from the credit card as a guarantee 
 old building old room furniture bad smell
 on arrival there was an issue with car parking which rather ruffled my feathers and to be honest it was not all the hotels issue however this hotel was very prompt to send a manager to me and listen too my concerns and reassured me and did everything possible to make my stay a perfect weekend so let me reassure you all if you where to be unhappy be assured that you should politely let it be known and they will do anything humanly possible to assist your concerns
 that there was a building site right next to the hotel an the air con was non existent no matter how low you put it
 i wish the early evening canap s and snacks in the executive suite were a little less stodgy 
 breakfast
 nothing
 it was a little pricey but you get a great hotel and great staff
 not a bad experience but hotel now needs a make over to keep as a top 5 hotel in lonbdon
 not enough staff on bar in the evening when we returned to hotel had to wait about half an hour to be served
 staff and bathroom
 reception staff very rude interrupted each other while seeing to customers never welcomed us never asked if we enjoyed our stay room was dark and claustrophobic overlooked a brick wall hardly any space between beside table and bathroom 
 nothing
 bed is a bit hard and not enough covers
 the hotel itself was not of hilton standing to me and my wife it was more like a back packers cheap and cheerful dormitory 310 50 and allegedly that was half price for 2 nights very let down disappointed put our 2 day stay on a damper as soon as we walked in to the place never again will i go there it resembles a very poor and run down hotel absolute dump 
 outside generator that kept us awake all night 
 nothing
 next time they should tell me that it is a gay hotel every where you been confronted with naked pictures of men too much sex oriented 
 i wish the location was a bit better there weren t many cute cafes or bars around but at least the tram that goes to the center stops right outside the hotel and the hotel sells 24 and 48 hour passes for the tram 
 when hotel gets crowded breakfast options are really limited body lotion missing so you need to have one of your own it might be relevant to some people 
 breakfast was rubbish
 n a
 when booked breakfast was included eventually it was not a full breakfast but continental breakfast you had to pay extra for a warm breakfast the restaurant staff disappointed but one older lady working in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful 
 lighting in corridors
 everything was ok
 fo9r 152 a night disappointed not to be able to make a coffee in the morning had to pay for one by calling room service mini bar was incredibly expensive 
 outdated rooms worn out no free wifi just 20 min is free it doesn t have the facilities of a 4 star hotel everything is pretty much basic 
 the lighting in the room was very poor and we needed to ask the reception desk for a lamp apparently is it a common complaint also toiletries were not replenished each day so we needed to ask for more at the reception desk
 the price is hefty and sometimes the privacy is not great 
 the bed was horrible way to soft and the staff did nothing to help with it 
 the air conditioning was difficult to adjust we asked for help but i don t think anybody did anything about it 
 the internet didn t work except in the lobby where it only worked properly between 4 am and 6 am very difficult to get necessary stuff done in that circumstance also no a c so we had to sleep with the windows open and carriages and tourists were lively drinking trotting well into the wee hours of the morning 
 the front desk staff weren t very friendly seating at breakfast wasn t handled very well someone took our table and we were given another table which was wasn t set up immediately one of the bedroom lights was broken when we arrived there was no directory of services in the room so i had to go down the hall to phone the front desk 
 standard of hotel has fallen badly over a number of years now it is now not worth using this hotel 
 much too noisy you cannot be a night club and a hotel at the same time
 the beds were joined to make a double bed and were very uncomfortable the staff are not very friendly for a britania chain breakfast should be included 
 got a call after we left saying we had consumed some of the mini bar which wasn t the case the chap on the phone was reasonable but it did leave a cloud over our visit 
 the blinds in the bathroom were not covering perfectly 
 nothing 
 there is a very unpleasant smell in the corridor leading from reception to the lift we stayed at the hotel at the beginning and the end of the week and the smell was still there even after reporting it on more than one occasion 
 everything was perfect 
 no seats in either japanese restaurant 
 bathroom wasn t clean when we got there pubes in the toilet walls are very thin so you hear the people in the next room as if they re there very small room 
 the bar does not have anything to eat after 10p m there is any restaurant near the hotel 
 no refrigerator to keep medecine in 
 none
 missing a bar area 
 nothing all was fine
 the shower was not very hot
 as much as i appreciate the charm of an old parisian hotel s antique interior i think that management ought to make an effort to ensure that the bathroom faucets sinks tubs and toilets maintain their lustre and are cleaner in appearance 
 the room was a bit stuffy even though we have maximise the ac 
 lift noise woke us up at night
 there was not steps or ladder into the pool therefore it was difficult to get out of the pool 
 room was a bit on the small side and bathroom very small
 staff attitude not helpful nothing in english for us to understand when we were leaving was hit with a bill that we had no idea what it was for man kept pointing to paper on wall with euro prices but was in bloody french no english and we are a deaf couple and asked him to write it down but kept pointing to wall so paid it and walked out not sure what we paid for 
 have stayed in a junior suite for several nights very bad house keeping not even a 2 star level leaving areas unclean never changing the bed sheets unless you told them they failed most of the nights to fill up nespresso capsules one night the whole floor was lost power it was returned back after half an hour without any apologies buffet breakfast was below average 20 per person the waiter asked for extra 4 for an omelet 
 the stay was great
 the smell of the room was quite stale and old
 bar drinks are a silly price 
 the lift is slow 
 smell of damp in the lower floors covered with strong perfume in the reception area we were given a room on the ground floor it had a strong smell of damp and the room was facing a space below the swimming pool area so that no daylight reached the room after complaining we got a new room on the third floor that was better 
 the food menu there weren t many american staples that i might enjoy i e bacon and eggs
 all male clerks
 no lift in the hotel so u have to use the stairs the a c is very bad cause at that time the weather was hot we suffered alot no trash basket in the room no one can hepl u with the luggages 
 the room was minuscolo really no place for more than an overnight bag 
 no variety in the breakfast buffet as we can not eat pork the ac in the room was not working and the maintenance guy ignored us as not much air was coming out they dont clean the room as they replace only the garbage bags and towels the rooms are not soundproof as we can here everything outside the room as if it were happening in ours 
 nothing really bad but the high tech controls in the bedrooms were in some ways a bit silly to locate an icon on a touch screen to turn on the bathroom light seems it for the sake of it a simple switch would be a bit more intuitive also the tv needed re booting and two of the touch screens died it didn t matter but it seems a bit ott 
 i think need more security the lobby need brighter colors the rooms need to be renewed
 the apartment was a little distance 150 metres from the check in it was on the first floor with no lift and a quite narrow staircase there was a reasonable amount of living space but the bedroom was on the small side with a 140 cm bed no bedside table no room and the door to the bathroom was barely 60 cm wide and the shower cubicle also seemed to be the smallest available there was also only one mirror a good one but no electric socket nearby so to dry my hair i used the reflection on the high gloss kitchen units 
 it s not my favourite kind of hotel not so warm
 plastic cups in rooms very tacky i don t remember the photos doing the hotel justice it really is a nice restaurant the bar closed at 12 this was too early 
 rooms are dark with lots of dark wood beds are uncomfortable need more english channels on tv to cater for english speaking customers 
 the rate
 the air conditioning was not what we would call great we could not adjust the temperature in the room and it would become stuffy 
 the interior of the building is a disgrace an executive double rm 104 cannot be true as very small with only a single chair 
 the staff have obviously all been told to try and create a party atmosphere but this comes across as inauthentic and gets in the way of what they should be doing which is to give guests a memorable experience for the right reasons 
 staff at reception were not great this only applies to one staff member that we were dealing with all others seemed fine not very friendly and it just felt like a very awkward situation also because we booked through booking com we were not given access to the wifi unless we paid for it was not happy about this at all 
 n a
 the 15 parking charge for a night is a disgrace this should come within the booking fee 
 the breakfast was ok nothing to rave about 
 some noise from next door child kicking a ball it sounded like 
 shower had to get reception staff to get it to work 10mins they said there was a special way of getting it to work once working lukewarm and up to your ankles in water not draining away very poor and staff quite indifferent when i mentioned it checking out 
 rooms are tiny and no choice of restaurants
 room too small and dinner very average
 not sure the room toilet with its opaque screen door will be to everyones taste but not a problem 
 nothing
 nothing
 wifi is very slow in some rooms 
 wifi didn t work in the rooms
 aged air con was very noisy 
 having to be asked if what breakfast we had paid for and that we could not have the cooked selection unless we paid more it was not done in a professional or discreet manner for an extra 4 50 this could have been done on arrival or included secretly within the room price and the choice is breakfast or not i thought when breakfast was included i did not then have to face a choice so coming down to breakfast felt quite insulting to be challenged at that point 
 no lifts in the hotel and no wifi at the time of my stay
 cramped room staircase couldnt even het to the wardrobe bad layout of the room cramped bath
 the wi fi doesn t work all the time
 the wifi was slightly annoying as you have to keep logging on everytime you switch on phone ipad it should remember you for an allocated time 
 that breakfast wasn t included in the room rate there are plenty of places nearby the hotel so it wasn t a problem 
 layout like a labyrinth not in a quirky sense and lifts in odd places could do with reviewing signs with someone unfamiliar with hotel layout 
 it could have been cleaner and interior dated and a bit worn
 the water pressure of the shower was very low
 room was small and we were told that this room was an upgrade but the room is not what you expect for that price
 nothing
 to small room
 nothing in general very good i think for the price
 many parts of the hotel have seen better days and the surrounding area is perhaps not very appealing to tourists personally i also think that the bed was too firm and squeaky 
 the room was very small and dark
 some of arab people with noisy talking at midnight so we can not sleep
 the taps of the washbasin and bathtub was broken so it was always too hot water coming from the taps although i said it to staff 3 times they didnt fix it there was no place to hang the shower it wasn t possible to even wash my face because of very hot water there was cracks on the walls of the hotel not renovated i don t recomment it 
 room to small price of cocktails
 kind of far from any central areas or train stations but that s mostly due to my lack of knowledge of the local transportation make sure to look at the map before booking to ensure it fits your needs also the neighborhood right next to it is a little meh with some brothels and etc 
 everything was perfect 
 the alarm sound in 05 33 in the night without any obvious reason and nobody explains us or apologised why in the norning 
 nothing
 the staff at counter seems to be inexperienced as they double charged me for room and then also for breakfast and it was big problem to not have funds in my prepaid travel card for regular tour expenses and even now we have balance double charge reversal pending
 the staff were weird
 huge hotel with 15 floors and hundreds and guests well functioning machine 
 nothing here
 nothing 
 staff did not speak a lot of english
 the knock on the door at 12 00 to see when we were leaving just as in fact we were leaving seemed a little unnecessary 
 not much around the hotel
 a little out of milan but still easy to reach by metro
 its very far to the metro station need to walk around 15 minutes there s nothing around the hotel no restaurant no gerosery and that s the only issue we faces
 rooms were very much smaller than expected felt cramped in
 breakfast was served in the lobby that is also used for check in out a bit of a discomfort otherwise breakfast offered a large variety of food and beverages 
 better control of temperature in the room sometimes too warm a better coffee machine at breakfast
 nothing
 the location might be good for attending exhibition to fira otherwise public transport connection is not enough there is one one bus and frequency is every 30 min and to the nearest metro station takes about 7 10 minutes to walk breakfast should have a bit different i stayed there for 7 nights and every morning had the same breakfast some dry salami look dry and pretty old
 there are no one off slippers penthouse closes at 21 00 
 initially i got an old not a clean room on the roof with windows impossible to open receptionist pretending i wanted a quite one and saying it was the best one that wasn t true after i rejected this offer another person offered a nicer room it looks like 5 star hotel doesn t guarantee you the best treatment may be it was a bad luck in my long experience of travelling 
 part of the hotel was being upgraded but obviously this is a temporary measure
 work been carried out at hotel which i was aware but not the fact car park will be closed also should have been clearer prior to booking closest car park 5 mins walk not great about 4am in the morning with rain hotel car park is very small not many parking spaces 
 tiny bathroom with very high sided bath and fixed head shower ideal for a six footer but not for someone much shorter
 breakfast was poor and breakfast area was so cold
 the refurbishing has been done very well the only thing that lets it down are the two feathery lampshades in the bar area near the wall mounted tv they look very old and tatty 
 the rooms are very very small 
 had to change rooms 3 times due to problems with the hot water toilets not working and no airconditioning their maintenance in this hotel needs to step up 
 we had a shock at the price of a blue angel cocktail at 50 the prices weren t on the menu so you didn t know until the bill arrived but it s the savoy the cocktail was served with flare and gold dust would i order it again yes i m glad my wife ordered the drink she wanted because she wouldn t have if she knew the price beforehand 
 pillows
 the shower in the room was fun but the room was actually pretty small and the layout was strange with the toilet by the door and the shower in the middle there went great facility for the price but vienna is expensive 
 bad restaurant and non professional staff
 the cabin of the shower wasn t being closed completely so taking a shower was a bit tiring so that everywhere didn t get wet we informed the reception about the situation but nothing could be done 
 the staff was t relly friendly would be nice to see good manners in a 4 hotel
 manager rabish
 i got the smallest room so i recommend to check room size prior to booking
 the breakfast is pricey and limited in selection 
 too short a stay
 nothing
 an usher called us a taxi outside the taxi was a luxurious one that cost us a fortune we called our own taxi for the return journey and it cost half the price couldn t work the ipad in our room and couldn t find any instructions 
 the balcony was in the shade so was unable to sunbathe on only a small selection for breakfast menu was the same every single day for lunch and dinner not the nicest area although tube station outside hotel 
 first room was by some noisy air con units staff very helpful and changed the room unfortunately the second room also had similar units outside but not quite as noisy have stayed there several times may look elsewhere in the future 
 building was a bit grim
 very poor room no mini bar non remodelled bathroom pitch dark if they are selling discounted rooms thru booking com then they should say the low cost is for a poorer room 
 the staff were always busy to answer my wuestions on the reception desk i asked for connected room but they gave us a room on 2nd floor and the other on the 3rd when we complained they gave us connected room however the other room was not clean has no toilitries and the water wasn t drained from the sink the housekeepers put no effort in cleaning the room although we gave them the whole day to clean them the breakfast was the poorest i ve ever seen only two tables of fruits yougurt and eggs along with nutella and juice 
 poor lighting in the room no lobby
 i can t find a fault in all honesty
 the room was smaller and somehow crowded than what is shown on the photos 
 more milk in room for tea and coffee 
 drinks rather expensive but other than that no complaints at all 
 it is relatively expensive and only a small number of rooms available
 the staff were totally incompetent the bedroom light wouldn t turn off the view looked directly into a building site the room wasn t ready on check in 
 wrong information and pictures given in booking for booked room the room was not clean you can notice the raisor cap that were on the floor during check in old facilities you had to log in continiously in order to have internet
 improve tv propgram 
 i had a room to the inner side w o a real window the price is rather high 
 the bath was just covered by a curtain 
 the pool being open
 bathroom and toilet
 no printed information about the hotel and facilities 
 would like a more modern bathroom
 nothing really
 expensive bar breakfast
 nothing in regards the hotel although now i know there are no front facing deluxe rooms i would reserve a different room type next time its also a bit expensive in our view but at least you know that up front 
 i didn t like the fact that you have to ring the reception eveytime you enter the hotel
 paid wi fi is a big let down 
 the shower toilet was very small and the ventilation extractor did not work this was reported but still made no improvement this was in a jnr suite 
 small room 
 nice room although too small 
 tatty around the edges bathroom window peeling and no fan in bathroom very small rooms 
 didn t have robes slippers and towels
 the bed had bed bugs and i have many pictures to prove it after complaining to the hotel they told us they were fully booked and could not move us and that housekeeping had gone home so there was nothing they could do i appreciate there was nothing they could do but i thought they could have called someone to try and make it better for us change the mattress maybe i had to stay in a bed bug ridden bed for another night woke up with more bites and it ruined my stay and made me feel ridiculously dirty 
 it was hot and we couldn t adjust the heat we were told you can t turn the airconditioning on in italy until mid may 
 expensive
 broken loo seat in room
 room was a little tired and had a musty smell 
 the standard double room is a little small
 service in the bar restaurant was not great 
 nothing
 the view was horrible i stayed for a whole week and my view was of an alley with construction equipment stored there there were no sheets just a comforter i asked for an extra blanket and got another comforter 
 i can t think of anything negative to say 
 the rooms could do with modernising slightly however it does bring some character 
 the temperature of the room was a little too high even with a c on and the mattress on the bed was a bit too hard so i didn t have the most comfortable nights sleep 
 breakfast dreadful minimal and poor staff the hotel is tired needs a makeover location is poor pay with the card you reserve with i had to wait 5 days for funds to be released for the full stay
 the fact that the closet and luggage storage were combined in addition the division between the closet and the bathroom was just a cork board with a gap in the middle 
 flawless stay not bad points at all
 nothing really 
 there wasn t anything in particular that we did not like 
 disappointing breakfast small room bathroom for the restaurant at the lower ground floor no slippers window not opening in the room
 some staffs not so great
 all good 
 staff customer service some were very friendly and some not so much 
 there were no socket adapters in the room once requested in the reception i was told to go and by one myself as they gave all adapters to other guest the room was tiny just to fit the bed 
 would have preferred a better view
 the tele doesn t move off the wall can not watch this in bed properly 
 noise of traffic in the edgware road junction windows should be double glazing type 
 this hotel markets itself as a 4 star and charges four star prices i suspect the french don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star there was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for 5 minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money
 repair the pool table and get some new cues in the bar 
 the fan in the bathroom wouldn t turn off and was quite noisey
 room not ready twice 
 room was tired and worn with holes in walls and flaking off wallpaper in places 
 noise from other rooms 
 dusts on the room walls
 staff unfriendly no toiletries in room everything about the hotel is very dated the bar only opens at 6 for a short time 
 my room was at the end of a maze long distance from the elevators it seemed to be a separate building that has been linked together later 
 had late check out and staff member came knocking before
 room service restriction upon requesting iron and table they refused to provide them due to unjustifiable security reason 
 the pillows were very uncomfortable 
 bed covers felt cocooned
 although room was paid in full for 7 days before arrival they blocked access to my room without warning because of a problem with the credit card given for extras for not even 100
 the room is very very very small no space for luaggues you hardly can move from one side to another
 problem during check in hotel restaurant for dinner was terrible 
 the price for breakfast is pretty steep considering the selection minor problems with tv set it wasn t working the last evening but we did not really need it anyways 
 size of the room size of the toilet shower room 
 when we arrive there was still building work going on in the room next door a drill was being used until 5pm on the friday i personally don t think you should have guests stay while there is building work happening next door 
 we need little bit variety of breakfast options
 very few negatives at this hotel we would have liked the air conditioning to have gone cooler but that s a personal preference 
 ac was not heating the room stayed 2 nights in a cold room informed reception however it did not change 
 breakfast was quite poor
 elevator was old
 where can i start room service we don t let you spend less than 15 per order not we will charge you a surcharge and provide customer service but more why don t you come to the bar and sort yourself out seriously for just under 200 per night sir you can t eat in the bar area but the bar area is empty our printing facilities on checkout don t work ok i can t give you a printed bill but promise i will email it across 2 email chasers later still waiting i m sl disappointed by how badly let down this hotel is by the service just don t bother i certainly will not 
 our loft was on the 3rd floor and there was no elevator wi fi was so slow and very bad connection 
 rooms are very small 
 all you could see from our window was a brick wall about 10ft away 
 on the small ap you can not open the windows also in the bathroom there is not a ventilator available for this reason we made an upgrade to a bigger apartment here was very nice but unfortunately in the toilet and also in the bathroom no ventilator available 
 it was perfect
 whatever cleaning fluid they use seems to have a very strong perfume something i dislike 
 airconditioning was inconsistent maintaining the temperature 
 the shower temperature was affected by external forces which could be dangerous the room was stuffy 
 travelodge at 4 times the price the hotel fairly centrally located had very little character no welcome made to feel a valued guest and amenities were basic on arrival the check in advised that she would upgrade the room as there was more space the upgraded room was smaller than a standard size uk room room service was basic sheets not changed floors not hoovered and dirty cups not removed and replaced with clean breakfast had a good assortment but on two mornings running left an unsettled feeling in the stomach the standard same reply to all reviews on this site gives away the lack of individual customer value and welcoming as shown in person walls between rooms were thin with full conversations heard and the noise from the trams on the road below at high floors was great the roof top bar sounded great but again there appeared to be apathy in customer care many tables littered with dirty glasses and a 15 euro price tag for a basic non adventurous cocktail there are many more hotels at this price in milan that would be better 
 the breakfast
 i struggle to find a negative point the only issue would be the internet being a bit flaky and slow 
 room was a little too warm 
 breakfasts at order is really lost of time and gives very narrow choice also rooms from street s side are noisy 
 mold on the bathtube dirty carpets cracks in the windows window view on the ac devices and dirty wall the pictures absolutely do not reflect the reality such a hotel would have maximum 3 stars in poland i m going back to london soon but will choose another hotel 
 the room given was next to some work and the room smelt of glue and paint and you couldn t open the windows then next room was horribe view of all the scaffolding work in leicester sq which wasn t mentioned at booking in the end i was giving the penthouse but i had to pay extra for it luckily it was a surprise for my boyfriend so paid it 
 quite a hike to the top floor but worth it 
 the carpets in our room were filthy dirty
 the bed sheets were rough we had a rash after 2 nights no toilet amenities so we needed tooth paste they said they would but never did 
 while i loved my stay i must say that the chamberlain is looking a little bit tired and dated and to be fair that s not a complaint just an observation 
 the dinner menu could do with some changes and served on plates and not planks of wood 
 nothing 
 two problems i had with this hotel one minor the air con kept switching itself on all night i was freezing and had to get out of bed every half hour to switch it off so no sleep the lady gave me 10 off my bill at checkout but what wasnt ecplained is that they take a 50 deposit when u check in this would have been ok if this was explained to me and to be told three after i checked out i looked at my bank statment to see an extra 130 is pending to the hotel my room rate was 80 which is fab good price minus the 10 discount 70 i have been charged thats fine but they was meant to deducted from the 130 they froze on my card the deposit i wasnt told about so i should be owed 60 still this isnt the case a seperate 130 is still owing and still hasnt be returned to me i phoned twice an been told different things an that i now have to wait till next weekend to have it back disgraceful service will not be booking again 
 the drinks in the bar were extortionately expensive 
 bed very hard and hotel very tired looking more 3 star than 4
 the pillows are uncomfortable
 tv impossible to operate unable to go to room at 2pm not ready
 room safe didn t work i do wonder why hotels don t check such things 
 wifi is poor and the bed strolling away easily 
 nothing
 window in the room facing a wall so not much natural light 
 nothing could have gone better
 rooms are very small 
 nothing
 booking com website says there is shuttle service from airport that was not the case hence we took eurostar which was very expensive 
 a little bit far away for shopping center should take bus for 30 mins 
 the lady that checked us in struck me as a little miserable although she didn t do or say anything bad to us a smile couldn t hurt she does work in customer service after all 
 have no complaints at all for the price it s unfortunately not going to be a regular thing but if you ve got the money spare or want to treat yourself i can thing of nowhere better near this location 
 rude girl on check in bathroom in bad shape 
 the reception staff on leaving was a let down 
 bad sound from ac
 there is not air conditioner and the main street can be a bit noisy if you open a window we stayed in the winter so the windows were closed and the heat was on 
 limited menu at bar
 everything was fine to me 
 the breakfast was disappointed for a 5 hotel same 
 the hotel has very bad signal wi fi internet vey bad wi fi internet
 had several different interpretations of final bill to the tune of hundreds of euros resolved this issue but front desk seemed very disorganized and accounting practices there leaves a lot to be desired water from mini bar exorbitantly overpriced should have been provided gratis spa should have been included for the rate we paid 
 changing menu in restaurant so no fixed menu available at the time we visited 
 nothing really without being picky 
 the bathroom was a little old fashion 
 that i had to leave 
 absolutely nothing the staff at this hotel should be proud of the work they do 
 arrived late 11 p m absolutely nothing to eat bar was closing no snacks offered or even machines front desk was very arrogant and dismissive young man no amenities such as water etc everything had a price for us it offered no advantage in business district not close enough to airport or downtown a nowhere high price place 
 i am extremely unhappy about my stay at ramada apollo amsterdam my clothes were taken from my room by the housekeepers and put through the laundry service on the first night i was charged for this even though i did not want my laundry to be taken and cleaned also i asked for fresh toilet paper because housekeeping didn t bother to show up for the first two days and the housekeepers didn t deliver it i also asked for fresh towels and extra milk twice once it didn t come and the second time i was assured the receptionist will bring it up personally but i was ignored i had to come to reception to get the requested items to top things off i was charged on my card despite it being taken off the system on my check in also i lost my watch charger in my room 1216 and despite numerous attempts to get through to the hotel i didn t get a reply from them 
 the place itself was a bit hard to find
 rooms a bit cramped with little to no space for big luggage no bidet
 the air conditioning in the room was not working properly and on the ground floor the terrace was full of smokers that precluded us using it 
 the staff is not enough
 fish and chips no taste to the chips and the fish was tasteless maybe you should serve haddock also the batter was not cooked enough 
 nothing we didn t like i ve never said that about any hotel before 
 nothing
 th bed was short and unconfortable the room was dirty and small
 bed was a little uncomfortable but great idea of providing soft and hard pillows could provide more milk and coffee 
 they could not find the cc authorization letter didnt clean my room properly and have staff that barely understands english or cares 
 room service don t answer often
 nil
 rooms are a little small but then it is london 
 the photos wasn t accurate was not much different to a holiday inn
 n a
 leave the breakfast 50 paces down the road is better coffee and fresh not stale pastries at bar italia 
 v small room
 got fleeced for parking hotel is tired 
 the staff promised to leave a surprise in our room for my panthers birthday when we ve popped out for dinner but failed to follow their promise as there was nothing when we returned 
 cleaning has to be much better
 i picked this restaurant on the basis of two key points a bathtub and a good breakfast there is not a single bathtub in the entire hotel even though its advertised as such on booking com when i complained i was told by the check in desk that bath means shower and when i argued that she is incorrect she dismissed my point saying that she is right the breakfast was different cuts of ham which both my wife and i do not eat cheese selection breads and cereal no variation and no hot cooked items 
 room and front of house and breakfast
 breakfast was very uninspiring and at one point area was very crowded and there was no iron iron board in the room the iron service was in the morning from 8 30 and ready by 9 30 too late for a work day 
 i booked the hotel 2 months in advance and 1 hour before my arrival at 20 pm they called me and said they had a issue with one of the guest and he didn t leave so they don t have any room for me 
 the staff let the zetter down their first contact with you is not great my girlfriend arrived after me and the staff were quite unhelpful in getting her to the room the service in the restaurant was slow 
 the prices for the breakfast that could have been purchased seemed quite high
 for such a high standard hotel the wifi should be faster it was slow most of the times the breakfast is a little too pricey almost 18 if you book the room without breakfast included but i suppose that s normal 
 nothing
 not being able to open the window room on the small side 
 the hotel is a little bit difficult to be reached by car 
 a little noisy in night
 nothing
 shower is tiny towels are small room is very small 
 lots of dust in the room cleaners clearly not doing their job properly also every morning around 10am we d receive loud banging on the door asking if we d left the room so the cleaners could come in hotel and staff great cleaning system needs to be reviewed fast 
 poor breakfast poor nreakfast service had a hair on scrambled egg no sauce when i asked for it no tea pffered or received reception staff excellent however
 the bed are small and the wifi not free like other hotel
 nothing
 continuing building works inside and outside the hotel 
 for a deluxe room it was tiny as was the bed it was also on the ground floor and we had requested an upper floor on the booking details on arrival they attempted to charge for the room and the room was only ready exactly at 2pm
 there wasn t anything we didn t like 
 the hotel
 the bathroom was ridiculously small had to sit on the sink to close the door bathroom door should open outwards 
 nothing to complain about however this hotel is located in the business district of london and may not suit all it was disappointing that the added treats in the lounge were not available on the weekend 
 the hotel is of very poor level of security one morning on 27 feb 2016 two friends of mine had breakfast in the breakfast room and during the time they were having breakfast there was nobody in the room except for staff when they finished the breakfast and about to leave the room they discovered the bag storing all personal items valued at 15 000eur were stolen it was really like a movie as tourists first time being the city we asked hotel staff to check however they refused to have any collaboration and directed us to the local police who has not unveiled any investigation results so far we can attach our report of the case to the police the hotel has not taken neither official apology nor actively informed us any result found it was really disappointing experience living in this hotel 
 sub standard rooms for the price they charge 
 overpriced 
 breakfast not included in rate was expensive we had a view of construction site that was opposite hotel no bath
 sadly it is located just within the congestion charging zone beds could use some harder more comfortable mattresses they weren t that good acceptable only 
 rooms are pretty small
 small room
 limited onsite parking which has a height restriction closest car park is just round the corner but isn t ideal for parking overnight 
 when i check in one of the receptionist gave me bad room but after i comply they correct the problem
 thermostate could have been more easy to set
 1 the room was average it looked a bit dated but still okay 2 the worst thing about this hotel was how cold the room was the windows were so drafty it was uncomfertable 
 n a
 tried to book a room for the second night but the lady at the front desk said it would be double what we paid for the first night we just checked out and booked on booking com and checked back in a bit of a hassle but it saved a ton of money 
 no plug sockets beside beds this was no good for charging mobiles or ipads etc 
 lighting in swimming pool rather sad especially at the far end which looked dingy would have liked a continental breakfast to have been included in the price 
 tiny wardrobe ridiculously small 
 it should be maintained better 
 very poor matress i had a back pain and couldnt sleep whole night 
 n a
 the price
 the bed was a little uncomfortable but only a small thing on an otherwise good stay 
 decor is very dated and in real need of updating
 the quality of the food at breakfast was fine but not up to the standard of everything else about this excellent hotel 
 window on the street a bit noisy
 cons the rooms are old and in need of refurbishment for the price we paid it is definitely not worth it the toilet is terrible too with no draining system on the floor leaving the floor wet all the time after showering which could have been prevented if there is a proper draining system not to mention the shower head could not be place properly and have to hold it all the time during shower these are basics amenities that should not be overlook 
 the surrounding of the hotel is quiet
 the alcoholic drinks are slightly over priced which is a shame as it discourages people from having a nightcap 
 nothing
 no comment 
 breakfast was very good but it would have been better with fresh berries 
 nothing apart from there is currently no parking
 no tea coffee making facilities in room the heat very difficult to work out the controls as there were no instructions overhead shower which drenched the floor but not me everywhere a bit tired and in need of re decoration
 insanely noisy hot no view no sleep
 apart from wetherspoons and gauchos next door everything else was closed at the weekend because it is the financial district but we walked up to liverpool st on sunday morning where there is plenty of choice of places to eat 
 soft beds bad smell from the bathroom no refrigerator
 i know it s only a small thing but i don t like it when there isn t a separate shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom
 the wifi was a little slow at times and took a while to connect the food in the restaurant has gone down a little from the first time i visited back in 2012 the food is not fresh everything is frozen and fried my duck was over cooked it would have been nice to have a glass of wine with my meal considering it was valentines nothing was done by the hotel the bath in our room wasn t the cleanest
 small room
 paid parking
 on a main street too busy 
 there is limited option for vegetarian people in the breakfast and i suggest that the hotel starts serving some hot potato items like hashbrown for breakfast 
 no complaints 
 t v is not user friendly
 the room was fine but could do with redecoration 
 the room was not as clean as it should have been there was a fan on in the room that made a noise all night unable to find the switch to turn this off 
 no restaurant and bar in the hotel at site
 nothing
 the price would be less expensive
 shower could have been better it needed some maintenance to secure it when turned on 
 bed felt like it was lob sided felt like i was rolling off mini bar didn t have full menu 
 small bedroom and bathroom needed decorating as paint peeling off wall in bathroom
 way too expensive for what you get the rooms are really just basic accommodations with some extra spent to look nice very understaffed at checkout as well 
 very weak wifi in the room especially during the day no international tv channels none english speaking channel the receptionist made mistake in booking didn t follow our directions and he booked wrong time for a table in our favourite restaurant 
 it was impossible to turn on heater in our room
 nothing 
 can t think of anything in particular
 breakfast buffet opened too late slow serving noisy from nearby hospital and street 
 cold room old and tired
 the room we had this time was smaller than we had on our last visit and right opposite the lift which concerned us however the room had everything we needed and there was no noise at all from outside the room 
 very poor shower broken magnifying mirror poor lighting in bedroom
 the bathroom is to smol the personality of the recipient staff is not very nice 
 rooms a bit small
 nothing i loved the place only complaint which is very minor is that i did not have my shower cap replaced more frequently 
 the room was really small although the bath was ok 
 room dated and small 
 parking is on the expensive side although probably relatively good value for amsterdam they do not yet have a licence to serve alcohol a minor inconvenience but if it could be resolved it would be the perfect hotel 
 air conditioning was difficult to control housekeeping did not make up our room on the 2nd night 
 the bed was lovely and big but not very comfortable or well made i was woken in the night by a lot of noise from another guest no herbal tea in the room 
 nothing
 mildly annoying pillows like bricks not significant
 we stayed in a suite with private pool the only downside to our stay was that the pool wasn t heated it was very cold this may not be the case when the weather i warmer 
 maybe the bar could open a little later as it felt like we were rushed out of the way
 breakfast room may need one more coffee dispensing machine there was a line for coffee at peak hours 
 i wish the breakfast buffet at the restaurant could be less expensive it made me choose for other options outside the hotel 
 price could be slightly cheaper
 room got too hot in the night 
 not a thing 
 a bit old fahisoned room
 we were told by phone that the hotel was wheelchair accessible and there s a good access but when we came there was nothing the lift was broken for months that they had to lower a ramp every time we want to go in or out the hotel which was not comfortable at all for my mother we explain our concern to the hotel manegment and they apologized and said there is nothing they could do or offer
 the pillows were huge i had to sleep with a folded towel whilst the breakfast would have been good the plates were cold the food got cold very quickly and items like the bacon were not available at the same time 
 permanent noise outside by air con 
 old windows should be replaced or refurbished
 the sky bar was very noisy
 i could heard my neighbors above me but my friends had better experience beside that it was great friendly staff
 bed needs to be more comfortable needs to have more bath products so you can have a nice bubbly bath but that s me being picky also have an updated iphone connector in the room so we don t have to leave the phones down stairs to charge
 room was a little on the chilly side despite increasing the stat music in the bar a bit too loud for normal conversation 
 nothing 
 the room at the first floor on the reception noizy
 i m not a big fan of the breakfast bag but it s not bad either
 the room was very narrow considering the price 
 i have stayed in a numbers of hilton and paid less for the night and also has gym and had a pool with sauna facility you had neither i was also charged 99 per room on my card extra on arrival as a deposit this was not brought to my attention when i checked inn i had paid fully in november last year for 7 rooms i am sure this is not legal and to put salt pin the wound it will not be credited till later in the week i will defiantly think twice before staying in hilton again 
 no luxury features but still nice functional hotel 
 the cleaner repeatedly knocking
 breakfast was a little bit chaotic
 breakfast buffet pricey
 bar area far too small for such a large hotel long queues for breakfast 
 please see comments above also i had phoned in advance requesting an early check in yet this wasn t possible for the room type i required i ended up having to agree to have a room with one bed which i had to share with my 12 year old son 
 i hate those mingy serves of milk 
 no thing
 nothing
 little bit small
 nothing
 no bedside table on one side and nowhere convenient to plug in the kettle 
 really need good quality double glazing i was not aware that st paul s chimes every 15 mins throughout the night very poor sleep 
 the hotel room was really cold and the hot water took forever to come especially at night 
 small rooms
 make sure to ask for a room on the side of the hotel that s not facing the train station 
 i loved it all
 neighbourhood not great
 nothing 
 do not stay if 1 you have luggage there is no place for your car to stop on the road and our request for someone to help us with the luggage up the stairs was ignored your car will have to park opposite the hotel in a side road and you will have to push your luggage across a busy road and thronging sidewalks whereupon you then have the further privilege of carrying luggage up the stairs on your own request for assistance will be ignored same applies when you check out 2 you have children who watch television the television channels do not work they did offer to change us to a room with working television channels if extra amounts were paid 3 you watch the news for the same reasons cited above television is an extra cost that you have to pay for 4 travel with companions only one set of towels was provided despite a family booking a request for extra sets was met with a direction to look in the cupboard we found one extra set therein which after our hunt was still insufficient 5 you want a normal bed beds were set on wheels and moved away from the headboard as the night passed i would have liked to give a score of zero if possible 
 drinks at breakfast was slow they need to get an automatic coffee machine
 the bed it was smaller than it looked the room was hot even with the air con on they didn t have enough pillows even when we went to their store room for the extra things 
 most lights at the room didn t work there weren t enough shampoos in the bathroom 
 to much money for this hotel 
 the staff and the organization of our rooms was disgusting the rooms were available 2 3 hours after we tried to check in we wasted an hour trying to arrange the check in the receptionist who was dealing with check in was most unhelpful she told us to go grab a drink in the bar by the lobby to which all the staff ignored us and said we needed to go to the roof top bar for a drink we then went back to the reception only to find the previous staff member has disappeared we then had to sort our check in deposits all over again no one apologized about the delay no one was bothered in the slightest we nearly missed our dinner celebrations due to this luckily the restaurant pushed back our table they also tried to put our rooms on seperate floors when we had 1 group booking 
 their wasn t really anything bad
 larger bed
 the breakfast room is far to small for the dimensions of the hotel there is only one chef preparing the eggs and this means waiting in line with a plate in your hands 
 nothing
 nothing
 bed against the wall had to climb over my partner to get out of bed 
 dirty toilet better cleaning needed
 the pool was ice cold due to breakdown or maintenance but obviously couldnt be helped 
 nothing
 small bed 
 everything was actually perfect 
 the hotel needs maintenance and cleanliness
 food service
 room not available till 15 00
 there was nothing to dislike 
 a little bit overpriced imho
 heating in the room was hard to control and not very good the room didn t cool when thermostat was adjusted 
 decoration is a bit over the top to our taste and slightly dated but if you like an opera theme you will probably enjoy it 
 transparancy glass tualet in a middle room with echo effect very strange 
 disturbing noice from out and inside traffic doors elevators 
 small rooms
 the staff clearly weren t used to having guests in jeans a hoodie and trainers a few disapproving looks too many 
 can t find a single thing to complain about 
 check in took little bit longer than i would expect but nothing dramatic
 it was perfect 4 us 
 the whole place is under renovation it should not offer services to public lifts not working guest have to climb stairs to their rooms 
 single bed no heating frayed towels location of sockets noisy extractor in the bathroom plug for bathroom sink didn t work 
 no fridge
 very slow internet connection 
 somebody s nails in the bathroom
 nothing
 nothing 
 our room door 618 was not working proparly every day i complain about it for 3 days also they capture an amount of money upon i reserve the room then they had 2 cancelled transaction then upon the check out they had a third transaction 
 breakfast served a little on the cold side and eggs over cooked we paid a lot for our room service breakfast so you expect a little more 
 nothing
 nothing to complain about
 size of the room was a little small 
 not the hotels fault but we were up most of the night and were told it was boy racers on sloane street despite being on the 11th floor the noise was horrendous 
 not as good as it looks on the pictures 
 maybe a little difficult to find since the reception is someway from the street 
 waiting half an hour after checking in time 
 staff particularly in bar were beyond rude i work in service industry and rarely complain as i know how hard it can be however equally my down time is important and the service and rudeness of staff was just appalling complained bit no one cared stayed here 4 times never again
 loved everything only negative was stk we were looking so forward to dinner there however it was like a loud club at 10pm with drunk loud folk coming in to just drink and dance better to go for lunch as opposed to dinner
 cannot find my booking and wait long for check in
 room service food was ok but not great
 the bathroom was a little let down 
 1 a little far from metro station 2 full english breakfast need to add 5 pounds
 the wifi signal is bad and slow and it takes around 10mins by tram going to center
 the room we had was so small more like a room for one person this was the one thing that let it down you couldn t even fully open the bathroom door as the bed was in the way very poor 
 nothing 
 overpriced
 this was my second stay after 6 years at axel sadly i got hugely disappointed this time reception staff were constantly head down on their screens throughout our stay of 5 days and nights never attentive or genuinely interested in helping even when there was no one queueing we had to wait for the reception guy to finish his so important and never ending thing every single time breakfast was seriously bad they charge you extra even for basic fried eggs coffee was the worst we paid for a premium double room yet still asked to be charged 10 per head for every single spa access rooftop pool is basically an oversized bath tub apart from one guy the whole house keeping was shambolic one day we left one of the hand towels on the floor to be changed instead they took both of the towels along with the floor towel without replacing them with fresh ones bathroom got semi flooded and we obviously had to wait until the next day as there is no house keeping after 5pm in other words it all comes down to the management which is simply taking advantage of its gay selling point 
 everything it was terrible
 check out time
 showers out of order pool out of order not five star class
 this hotel contains two different hotel section in same building so the outside and entrance pictures of this hotel does not reflect the truth about your rooms rooms are so simple the bathroom is quite old furnished price of the hotel is too much for such standarts 
 the traffic outside can be noisy at night
 definitely out in the middle of nowhere and rather sketchy looking area too but there is a shuttle to the subway and if you have a car you will be fine 
 not enough info on how to make the most of the facilities and breakfast suggest a document on the brilliant tablet 
 nothing not to like
 pictures of john terry i am a little surprised that he is perceived by you to be a suitable role model to represent the face of your hotel i believe that there are less controversial indivuals that could have been chosen instead 
 nothing
 nothing
 room was great staff was helpful and food was fresh and all that we wanted great 
 nothing in particular 
 bit pricey in bar 
 bar service was very poor one barman could not cope had to wait for up to twenty five minutes to get serve
 shower pressure not good no light over vanity mirror very dark
 they forgot to bring butter for the toast which we had delivered to our room for breakfast 
 if you have a room with boulevard view it could be a little bit noisy because of the traffic 
 didn t read the booking details to see the advance notice we had given them regarding allergies
 nothing
 didn t like being rebuked by a chambermaid when i asked for a teabag
 1 elevator was not working 3 out of 4 days 2 the room was the smallest room i ve ever slept in a 4 stars hotel 3 the bathroom door was broken for 3 days and i told the reception and they kept told me they will fix it and nothing happpened 4 window doesnt open 5 ac takes two hours to cool the room 
 there wasn t anything i didn t like 
 the breakfast and the furniture
 only 3 coffee pods are provided in the room was told by karen that extra pods had to be purchased when i objected i got some more pods hot breakfast not available
 room very small and although the rooms are modern in comparison to the old building it was pretty scruffy in lots of places finish of carpet lots of marks on walls shabby blinds dirty doors etc and could really do with a refresh bathroom was modern but really tiny regularly stay in london but i wouldn t stay here again 
 unfriendly reception dirty hallways outdated stained sheets shower didn t drain and leaked all over the floor
 staff giving wrong information we pay for 2 breakfast only take for one because we need to catch the early flight have to leave hotel around 7 00am staff who take my payment is very bad use different language to say something i think is not good in front of us something about chinese
 nothing 
 room could have been a bit more luxurious only one chair decor in the room is not in keeping with the rest of the hotel it feels cheaper breakfast was included first night but not the second for this price it seemed a bit much 
 the air con in the room didn t work had to use fans for 2 days which was quite uncomfortable with it being 26degrees outside no one seemed to take action to fix it but once addressed with manager at check out he compensated us and was extremely apologetic and disappointed that the issue hadn t been addressed during our stay but we felt satisfied to return to the hotel again after speaking to the manager i would return to the hotel and it s a good location 
 everything was good 
 n a
 took too long to check in and check out
 the noise from the dlr which our room looked out on 
 old and small room
 small rooms as usual in paris 
 the room and hotel was very dated except from the lobby and restaurant hotel needs a refurbishment throughout pillows too big would be nice with a choice even in premier inn you get that i think we paid too much for what we got 
 the parking spaces in the hotel s parking lot are very narrow and difficult to manage with a wheelchair and there is no specific disabled parking bay i found the noise levels in the room quite high as our room faced kensington high street we booked the room on a booking com special rate at the usual rate i think the hotel is over priced 
 good location but over rated by booking com guests we had higher expectations on this hotel it felt like it had high standards in the 60 s anyhow in the end we we re satisfied with our stay 
 noise canceling wasn t the best 
 breakfast little bid boring always same everyday
 very simple breakfast and quite small triple room
 nothing negative to say 
 had the breakfast refunded as waited 50 minutes and hadnt arrived and informed half the items on the cooked menu was not available the breakfast is the main part of the morning and failed mould on the ceiling in the bathroom and mould on the mastic sealant in the bathroom room 118 this is a maintenance issue not cleaning 
 i didn t like the prices in the bar
 cost for our bike parking 26 for single day wifi connection on last floor very unstable we didn t have room cleaning as we did not advise first time i know this shouldn t be automatic 
 nothing
 lumpy pillows 
 the room could have had a little more lighting
 nothing
 would prefer the toilet area to be better segregated i don t want to hear my partners ablutions thanks 
 same breakfast daily 
 conceder reviewing the room price
 we had no balcony thats about the only bad thing i can say here 
 econonomy room is very small
 the rooms wasn t like photos much worse
 staff poor service small room bathroom poor no bidet shower flooded bathroom no hand held shower poor extraction handle missing off shower control 
 breakfast not included in the price no free wifi
 nothing everything was excellent 
 limited parking
 it s a bit off the beaten path from amsterdam centraal but it s worth it 
 just a little far from train tube but this reflects on the price
 no windows to the outside concierge staff was not friendly and helpful
 a shower curtain there was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor
 bed wasn t that comfy but have slept on worse
 the only negative thing was finding hair in the bath tub 
 very overpriced dye to location but not good value
 little dated but that is not important 
 small rooms and sounds from the street
 poor location of room poor night s sleep due to 5am bin cardboard collection
 if breakfasts were to be included that would make the best hotel i have ever been 
 no bar 
 room is small but then it s paree 
 tired hotel especially the bathroom could do with some love and attention
 its near every where satisfied in the place and it is safe the hotel 
 price is rather high but it is value for money the hotel is rebuilding and sometimes the sound of a pneumatic hammer is disturbing at 8 o clock am in the weekend 
 bed was not comfy and noisy
 the bed was a little bit hard for us 
 dirty old rooms for newly furnished room they asked us to pay extra on check in counter they will ask for higher floor newly furnished rooms extra bed not value of money at all when i requested for 1 hour late check out they gave me 45 mins funny for me anyways i ll not recommend this hotel for families as there is no place for shopping on walking distance other than m s it may be good for business travel
 the location is a bit awkward to get to the roof bar is very pricey 
 the fire alarm sounded at 5am by accident fully waking everyone 
 the carpet in the rooms are very old with dirty marks on we were told that the renovation work has started 
 no thank
 breakfast too expensive in context of cafes and restaurants in the immediate area
 no bad experience
 breakfast is simple i e cheap salami and turkey breast 2 types of cheese cheap bread bed bounces a lot toilet needs minutes to refill water for another flush receptionist night manager organised a taxi what wasn t a real taxi i think it was a friend of him 
 small misunderstanding about whether delicious breakfast was included but after several conversations we worked it out
 price
 this was the smallest room i ever slept the room was nothing except a bed surrounded by walls from three sides and a small hallway from door to bed internet connection was not stable
 not cheap but was very basic no air con struggled to open windows poor quality bedding
 room was quite noisy no biscuits 
 no coffee making facilities for the morning
 food rather cold on both mornings bagel rock hard i am just questioning final bill as i was charged 100 more for sunday night than saturday never happened before in fact quite the reverse 
 the check out timing and even the extended check out time especially for loyal customer like me expect normal check out 2 and extended 6
 shower space is small but seems normal in london
 liked everything about it
 bathroom too dark shower not ideal countertop material looks cheap with water easily accumulating requires constant mopping with face towel
 air con did not work properly and i found the room to warm due to this this made my sleep uncomfortable 
 we booked a triple room for 3 adults but it was a double room with an lesser quality bed added we were not always supplied with 3 of everything it was possible to see into the bathroom from the bedroom 
 the maid barged in when we were in bed the neighborhood was rather sketchy 
 room over looking road was noisy 
 location atmosphere no real gym for the size of the hotel no sauna at all
 walls are quite thin and i could my neighbours voices and music air conditioning was noisy 
 whilst the room we were allocated was small and perfectly laid out it was overlooking a back year and there was an irritating noise coming from some unknown source in the corridor 
 still lousy internet access and lousy service on internet access staff was very polite and friendly but not able to do much ridiculous to be asked to pay for upgrade for internet for doing business level work vpn and then ahve to face difficulty executing the upgrade 6 50 for the charge but cost me 200 00 for the value of my time calling for assistance and waiting for help this makes me decide to use the apex hotel next door which does not charge for higher speed internet and does not present hassles 
 there wasnt enough sugar and coffee it was only one pack of sugar and one pack of coffee they should actually put atleast 2 i had to share with my partner the cup of coffee because of the lack of sugar
 there was a long time between courses which meant we had to hurry to get to the show 
 the fitness room has only 2 machines and the rooms are very small for the price
 hairdryer only blew cold air bedside lamp didn t work and also mattress covers on bed plastic
 more coffee milk in the rooms please 
 nothing
 didn t look too clean because of entrance downstairs and the a bit dirty carpet on the floor but in fact the room was properly cleaned 
 restaurant next door not affiliated with the hotel played pounding music very loudly at night which vibrated in my room on the first floor saturday night the music went on very late and kept me awake my only complaint about an otherwise perfect stay 
 poor extraction in bathroom 
 room was a little cold and couldn t work out how the heating controls worked or maybe they wernt working at all only thing that annoyed us slightly came back after the concert and staff had obviously taken off the draught beer from the bar to make you buy the more expensive bottles 9 00 for a bottle of beer and a coke draught beers were back on first thing in the morning 
 the lift too small bathroom no hooks at all shower 
 i found very little to criticise 
 would have like to see a variation in the breakfast buffet 
 nothing 
 room small food terrible and expensive bad smell in corridor 
 only thing that let it down was our room backed directly onto a train line which was noisey late at night and 1st thing in the morning it didn t bother us too much but annoying nonetheless 
 much room to improve breakfast not many choices 
 the reception staff is good and nice but i lost stuff when i lived in there i think hotel manager should focus on this issue 
 when checking in to my single room it turned out to be no bigger than a storage cupboard and for 199 per night i would have expected more i had to pay an extra 60 to upgrade to a bigger room 
 the cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal we were checking out that day so no need to clean the room being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft 
 a little pricey particularly the lounge
 bathroom had a really bad smell when we first got there had to get staff to spray the bathroom bed wasn t too comfortable and room was slightly old fashioned
 location
 didn t like the way the way one of the receptionists would make a face and look a customer up and down after checking each one in as they walked away aircon in room wasn t working the first night and the second night we had a ceiling leak so had to be moved at 1am in the morning 
 maybe be advised on room location first would you like a quite room room was in a noisy location
 noises in the room from the plumbing upstairs broken tap
 the variety of the breakfast was not as good empty marmalade coffee was more water 
 nothing at all
 could have some draft beer in the bar 
 there was nothing we could fault 
 all good 
 the view of balcony not good enough 
 the elevator did not function and i was placed in 5 floor the stairway are a joke the old chines lady organizer of breakfast need a smiling course
 extremely rude staff not used to this at a holiday inn 
 i didn t find during one night staying
 the only thing i didn t like was the firmness of the bed it was far too firm for me and caused me to have a back ache but that is literally the only thing 
 the staff at the restaurant are talking to each other all the time and ignoring guests walking in their service needs to be improved also at the reception 
 staff were rude we upgraded the room for 50 eur to include breakfast and were charged 100 without letting us know and when we realised they had charged 100 they told us it was a deposit next day we were made to wait at the reception as they thought we had not paid for the breakfast staff were extremely rude and unwelcoming no one at the reception answered as they kept saying they were too busy don t recommend to anyone 
 to room to small for 2 people and the breakfast was sparingly no scamble eggs and bacon in a hotel in london so to expensive pr night we had one day with rain all day would have been nice if we could have borrowed an umbrella 
 room was basic no fridge or a c for a 4 star hotel is incredibly poor 
 bathroom requires a few repairs noisy room service hovering outside bedroom at 8 20 in the morning 
 i didn t like so much breakfast
 air conditioning leaked into the entrance to the room and was slippery i was with my elderly mother and it was a health and safety issue i did report it i had to ask for more sugar milk and tea bags on 2 separate occasions i think a new way of supplying these essential items could be reviewed 
 could not open window during the night as street was noisy cupboard very small pillows very hard and spongy step into bathroom lethal although signed 
 breakfast only average nonsens to use a semi automtic coffee machine for breakfast room long waiting time for a coffee 
 staff
 i would have liked a better view we looked out to a brick wall and big air conditioning units the room was lovely so we just drew the curtains 
 more seating areas that were not part of the bar or restaurant also would like to have been offered the premium lounge on checkin i would have used this had i known about it 
 we got a club level room which had a full bed in it while there was a built in closet desk area etc there was just no space to store luggage you couldn t walk around the parameter of the bed so both our suitcases were on the only opening of the floor hard to navigate with two tall people also unsure why there was no conditioner our paris hotel was the same don t know if it is a european hotel thing so if you are used to using conditioner bring some with you 
 no coffee in the room and breakfast was not included
 the room s bathroom was terrible when you shower the water splashes all over getting into the tub to shower was like trying to climb the spanish steps in rome 
 the staff at reception could be a bit nicer i had a problem with my booking as the girl at reception was not very helpful the receptionist charged me the hilton rate and not the rate that i had booked on booking com i was charged straight away on my card despite requesting to pay with a different card and then told that i would have to wait for my refund even though this was her mistake this was eventually sorted by the manager but 5 days later i still have not received my refund it wasn t a great start to our break away we booked a superior queen room which was basic at best i would not like to have seen the standard room the bedroom smelt of cigarettes upon arrival and had not been cleaned to he standard you d expect from a hilton hotel the beds were very hard and the shower curtain was ripped and tatty not professional looking also we stayed on the 8th floor and there was access to open the bedroom window even a small bit so we had to have the air con on all the time 
 for the class of hotel the breakfast could be better or provide more options 
 we stayed in room 606 no view at all in that room in fact the windows are small but there s nothing to look at anyway any room on the left side of the hallway will not have a view at all the room was very small the bed was not comfortable our room wasn t cleaned everyday actually it was only cleaned twice in 7 days also just about all of the tv channels were in french we brought our apple tv with us just in case that happened but the wifi was horrible so it kept cutting out last but certainly not least there was a fee of 60 euros for a late checkout plus a prorated fee for the time we were late checkout is at 11 we thought checkout was at 1pm at 1pm we received a call from the lady at the front desk i informed her i didn t know what time checkout was we d be right down we got downstairs at 1 30 and we were charged a late fee plus a prorated fee for every late hour so it s a charge on top of a charge i have never been charged for a late checkout i was very upset 
 more choice for the breakfast price is a bit high 
 bar menu was a little pricey 
 ripped bed sheets window won t open no kettle coffee or tea in the room basic selection of toiletries smoke alarm kept flashing all night through
 housekeeping was to a high standard but not very consistent in terms of supplies e g they sometimes forgot to bring in tissue paper 
 the entrance and the set up of the room 
 didn t like the fact we was not told about the work being done in the hotel bar upon arrival 
 breakfast at 23 was overpriced plenty of other options close by 
 nothing
 uncomfortable bed hard mattress small room needed updating broken shower holder so kept falling off noisy road
 at 2 pm our room not ready and the check in was too late around 4 pm and early check out 12 45 pm maximum it s too small in space and the break fast by order menu not an open buffet massage room not prepared for that purpose and it s not too close to shopping center need a taxi 
 location was difficult as couldn t pull up outside to unload cases toilet seat was broken and there wasn t a fridge in the room or any ice machines anywhere 
 internet
 ageing bathroom
 bed was saggy 
 it was raining 
 not enough coffee sachets in room my car got damaged on car park someone deliberately ran a key down the passenger side 
 things should be arranged properly when rooms are made
 shame the breakfast was so expensive and the bikes should have been more reliable
 size of room too small
 the location is a little bit away from the city but it is ok not a big problem 
 would be nice to have a coffee maker kettle in the room
 the rom was little small
 mattress was very uncomfortable we were able to listen even to the smallest noise coming from the other rooms a cross the hall room doesn t have any insulation at all no help with luggage you carry it yourself which is not a biggie if the hotel didn t have 4 stars no coffee in the room either again very weird for a 4 stars
 your employee andrei at executive lunch is racist he does not deserve to your hotel staff as he is damaging the high reputation of your hotel
 would be nice to have kettle in the room
 no complaints
 knocking on window due to high winds bath a bit high 
 the rooms were very small the first room we were given was tiny not good enough then we got another room the bathroom was tiny you could hardly turn around felt very clastphobic
 location
 the breakfast area was too small and the kids room was in 1 side our suite in the other side 
 breakfast 14 was a bit much 
 rooms were not fully cleaned each day beds sheets changed bins emptied but used wine glasses left the mini bar didn t work reported the fault nothing was done about it this is not a four star hotel experience more 2 star 
 nothing major
 for the price we paid for three nights a breakfast one of the morning inclued would of being nice we were out sight seeing most of the day and would have a drink and something to eat at the bar when we came in at night 
 the room was really really small no place to put your things slow elevators 
 old fashioned hotel needs a serious renovation carpet in the hotel is from the 70 s the air condition in the room is a very noisy hired unit which stands on the floor staff is mostly from eastern europe where they don t write hospitality with a capital h the hotel is completely over priced 
 bar area could have been more cosy 
 not a big issue at all but you can t use the lift after 10 30pm which for us was fine but being on the third floor might have been more difficult for people who struggle with walking the sign in the lift mentioned to contact the staff if needed so i m sure they would remedy the situation either way 
 the shower was not that powerful the sink in bathroom kept getting blocked and the housekeeping was poor beds just thrown up toilet roll not refilled nor was the tea and coffe when used there were 10 people in my booking 5 twin rooms and they all had the same opinion on house keeping over priced for the service we received 
 rooms tiny i have stayed there a few times but don t think i will go back wifi disconnects every 2 minutes lots of stairs no lift the rooms used to have a bar fridge but they don t now i complained the room lights were not all working still not working 
 wifi service
 as a guest staying for two nights having to pay an additional 15 00 for car parking on the second night due to an event at the stadium was not called for 
 poor ventilation in our room and no mini bar expensive wifi 15 per day for wifi in room is a bit too much 
 room was a bit small
 the wifi on the first floor was horrible 
 room cleaning services need improvement
 coffee that cost 5 60 in the restaurant
 no smoking room the price was higher than the service and hotel facility
 stains on the bed throw
 it wasn t a bad experience but we thought that the hotel s stinginess over milk tea coffee sachets was poor when i asked if we could have milk from the cafe we were charged 2 for a glassful 
 staff was not friendly
 the bed 
 n a
 more seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets 
 breakfast from a set menue i prefer a small selected buffet 
 the internet connection need improvement can be faster 
 front desk upgrade my room there is some door which is comnected with other room also it rocked so i hear the sound of love from that door 
 poor maintain phone and tv not functioning properly room was located next the linen room and chatted loudly early in the morning breakfast very expensive
 parking not easily accessible and a bit expensive
 it is a 4 stars hotel and the room was not in that level small and tiny tv for payment the shower did not work well breakfast too expensive 
 found the breakfast staff quite unfriendly and unhelpful 
 the mattresses could be updated 
 the smell of cigarettes late at night in the room presumably from the roof terrace bar 
 the breakfast was a bit expensive and not many foods to choose from 
 mould in the shower around the tiles and shower screen complained to reception but nothing done to rectify the problem 
 the mini bar prices are totally outrageous 
 cost of breakfast it s extortion 
 bed hard as fathers room also very very warm
 it took us 1 5 hours to find the hotel nowhere on the outside of the mitre pub was there an indication that this was also the innkeepers lodge hotel and nobody we spoke to had ever heard of it including local taxi drivers 
 looks tired and in need of a refresh
 shabby room
 didn t like being woken up in the middle of the night by shouting swearing and banging about which seemed to go on far to long heard everything like it was inside our room 
 empty fridge 
 price of beer 
 room was very noisy right beside lift across the road from actual main building faulty iron and no apology when i asked for a working one don t bother
 noisy dirty very expensive
 nothing not to like
 the room was tiny with no tea or coffee making facilities mini bar etc the decor was dated and the bed was also very small there was also no wifi in the bedroom for the price we were not impressed 
 
 this price should include breakfast
 stress your attention talking about hotel which rated with 4 stars first of all staff asks to present your credit card and makes copy of that without any notification people on reception desk are rude and do not care about guests comfort my attempt to explain issues with my door locker was absolutely ignored breakfast is fair waiters are indifferent issue even get cup of coffee 
 nothing
 poor service unhelpful staff and unnecessary charges
 that our room window looked out onto a wall also the room was dark this was probably because the window looked out onto a wall 
 absolutely nothing 
 the twin room badly planed out needs an extra chair no mirror full length mirror in one of our rooms opaque glass door on wc shower room this fails to give privacy electronic door key failed to work due to been next to phone had a drink in bar late in the evening very expensive pint and g t 19 but we did have a good stay the location is great starbucks s pizza express a pub opposite really close to euston st pancras kings cross
 nothing to grumble about
 no hot chocolate in room
 lighting in the corridors and the shower facilities in the room 
 hard to turn on off the lights 
 it is in the heart of ramblas so very busy with people the minute you walk out the door this also means a lot of street noise until the early hours
 tiny gripe needed a mirror in room when using the hairdryer
 rooms could have been cleaner windows were old 
 food there wasn t a variety to choose from 
 no receptionist at night time 
 booked last minute and were given a disabled room 
 nothing 
 disappointed the skybar closed before the 11pm time stated on a saturday night
 nothing really it was nice 
 no plug sockets near the bed 
 the cleaning lady had taken my waterbottle from my backpack during the roomcleaning when me and my son weren t in the room it s wrong that the cleaning lady had been digging in my personal belongings and taken the bottle from my own backpack 
 no providing one use slippers
 i fail to see how this is a 4 hotel the room was cramped big cracks in the sick carpets stained and shredded chairs in the dining room were stained and dirty whilst there we were also not advised that construction work would be starting in the next room at 8am monday morning which we were not pleased with all in all this was a complete nightmare stay and frankly not worth the money we paid we will not be staying here again absolutely shocking hotel 
 nothing
 breakfast
 stairs in the room made it unsafe for our baby
 the bathroom could have been bigger 
 the only two things i would change are first the lack of a window we only had skylights in our room and second the street out in front of the hotel is totally torn up and is an eyesore i am sure that the hotel management is not happy about the street either 
 the area was good for us for proximity to st pancras but might not be ideal for all tourists 
 daily breakfast never changed needed more varieties
 the front of house was rather snobby and offhand she needs some training in proper manners and being welcoming to guests at the hotel all other staff were welcoming and helpful 
 nothing
 noisy the cleaning ladies were very noisy while carrying their stuff down the halls a lot of noise also coming from the street the bathroom has a gliding door which doesn t close properly so you couldn t have your privacy heating was working all the time and had some trouble sleeping because it was too hot
 fire alarm
 the food was not good
 room to hot asked for top floor and got ground floor room 
 bathroom tatty in need of modernisation bed was very uncomfortable impersonal self check in that i would not associate with a 4 star rating 
 best to tell people to disembarking at argentine much closer to hotel
 breakfast gets overcrowded and can be managed bit better
 lift wasnt working but we got a free drink
 the room was too small not cleaned during my stay very noisy air conditioner and the room was too hot for comfort
 nothing 
 it was amazing from start to finish no need for improvement 
 could be more parking facilities
 beed to put more varaity of breakfast
 slow with coffee at breakfast
 it s a little out of the way from central amsterdam but the free shuttle is well worth it and it is only a short walk into the centre shower bath can be a little dangerous and is quite small and the bathroom doors are just vanity covers so the bathroom can t be fully closed off 
 green light in the room never turned off 
 shower head over is over a bathtub which is raised from the floor some extra centimeters coupled with a rather slippery floor without extra handles this makes getting off the bathtub a little uncomfortable common areas could do with some renovation refurbishing as some carpet is worn out and parts of the decor seem as if they ve seen their best days already 
 the only thing was the lift was very small 
 left a pair of trainers in my room when i checked out my fault but were not found by housekeeping 
 room was looking tired and some furnishings and fixtures need replacing bathroom showed signs of previous leaks and badly repaired 
 very small room no view hard or old mattress and annoying loud sound from the mini fridge
 bloc my pre payed card still after i gave them my other visa i hope i get that back 
 we had issues with drainage in the shower blocked by hair that wasn t ours and for the price you would expect basics like the pillows to be decent and the mattress wasn t comfortable either 
 one thing in my room i did not have was tea and coffee and a kettle for a hot beverage i was told i needed to upgrade quite surprised there were no facilities for a hot drink 
 told we could buy tickets for sites went to buy two for the eiffel tower and was told we couldn t buy any website said 10 mins from eiffel tower it was a 30 40 minute walk 
 nothing negative to say enjoyed my stay there
 not secured
 wasn t very clean at all finger marks everywhere view from the room was terrible was facing another hotel under construction just a couple of meter s away no bath either
 nothing
 i thought that the breakfast was rather expensive 14 euros maybe provide the option for a half breakfast 
 n a
 room looked a little tired it was quite noisy from taps and toilet flushing in the early hours last time we stayed here it was very quiet at night maybe we were just unlucky this time 
 at times wifi was a bit disrupted 
 bedroom was so small we had to climb over our luggage to get around it the pillows were terrible this was supposed to be 4 star but was far from it 
 old stains on the carpet but otherwise clean 
 room booked was not available so after waiting a long time we were upgraded to an exec room the air con did not work and it was boiling so had to sleep woth window open all night hardly slept because of the noise outside the shower was dangerous scalding
 noisy no restaurant no bar
 reception need to get more organized and ready especially when there is a lot of people waiting their turn for check in
 wifi good and free but sometimes unstable 
 our room was at the back of hotel with no view but as this was just a three night stay this did not bother us if we had stayed longer i would not have been happy with the room for that reason also they were quite mean with tea coffee 2 of each and no milk even though there was a fridge in the room milk cartons did arrive the second day 
 the building under construction
 the water was not hot and the lighting in the rooms not adequate
 need better directions from metro
 smell in the hallways the air is stale view from our room was concrete across 
 nothing
 i liked every thing
 nothing 
 the way of payment was wrong they reserve more than the total of cost later they took another payment of cards means they took the cost twice 
 check in was very cold without smile there no enough parking space in the garage so i had to drive in public garage 
 the check in requested room early but the computers were down so we had to change in the toilets not what i wanted for my birthday only had the room for 8 hours
 felt more like a travelodge than a supposedly 4 star hotel small rooms ugly decor bog standard hotel features nothing exciting whatsoever not worth the premium 
 unfortunately we had very inconsiderate people on our floor that were very noisy and when we told reception staff they said they would investigate but we didn t get any other feed back we would have liked to have been moved also although there were three of us in the room only two of everything was provided i e glasses mugs 
 expensive
 it is not 5 star only just 4 the butler promised didn t materialise room service was slow the chambers lounge is somewhere between a british rail lounge and a second rate airport business class facility paintings chosen for the suite were absolutely appalling and the lillies chosen to refresh the the room were the type you get from tesco as i said not even close to 5 stars the staff try hard but unfortunately i don t believe they know what 5 star looks like the whole experience is in another and inferior league given the price tag this was a highly unsatisfactory choice 
 price average breakfast 
 room
 price of breakfast
 room was a bit shabby hairs on chair sink was dirty reception staff were not very helpful guests in room opposite decided to have an all night party and had people coming and going all night an expensive stay for a view of a building site would say it s a hotel for younger people who have lots of money and don t need much sleep 
 i can t think of anything i didn t like this is a great hotel 
 we had executive rooms and although the executive suite had snacks and basic drinks they could have had a better range
 nothing
 i would welcome a bottle of water without charge after all it is not that much to expect nowadays and a tea coffee facility also i found very inconvenient being charged long before arrival date for all the rooms i reserved for myself and my bussiness partners it took quite a while sorting this matter out lucky we were not in a hurry 
 breakfast didn t look tempting especially at that price many better choices around 
 high price on all beverages breakfast wasn t very nice for 15 00 19 95 if not pre booked 
 the attitude of the staff not friendly and not professional terrasse rooms are ok but are on the first floor with a view on the building across the classic room is not nice at all bathroom especially not convenient 
 the breakfast was varied and good but rather expensive my friend had one poor vegetarian bar meal but it was when there was a large tour group being catered for 
 nothing to complain about here 
 everything was great except the bed was lumpy room 41 
 a bit on the expensive side
 rooms overlooking train line very noisy room was cold and bed was uncomfortable 
 the sound proof isn t that good
 i travel a lot and the room was way overpriced 
 i liked everything
 provision of tea making facilities in room would be welcome 
 room card did not work so had to go back to reception mini bar was locked although had paid on credit card for extras complimentary bottles of water were not there
 room walls need better soundproofing 
 nothing
 bar staff were beyond rude they were downright ignorant and there customer care was no better i d of had better service at fawltey towers certainly not what i would of expected seriously go elsewhere there s much better value in same area
 nothing to dislike 
 room could have been a touch bigger but perfectly ok for a short stay
 n a
 perhaps a fridge would have been useful
 location was difficult to find especially coming in at night we were lucky to have found a local who gave us wonderful directions after 20 min of wandering aimlessly lost hair dryer did not work only lasted 3 min before cutting off no wash cloths and the towels were great if you enjoy drying off with tiny over starched towels we also found that elevators were overlooked a few times we found spilt alcohol drinks in puddles on the floor inside and out of the elevators 
 the room was small and very very hot we had one fan and was not enough by asking at the reception we could get another fan but even so it wa very hot 
 room was a bit small wifi didn t work 100 of the time
 would have taken yoghurt if it had been by the spoon a pot was way too much so didn t have any the tv screen in the bedroom was too big for me 
 very narrow bed only paid internet
 the a c was terrible carpet was filthy and the room was very small 
 the shower had no power yet because of the poor design i managed to flood the toilet wash hand basin area each time i showered 
 this is a big hotel and feels often overcrowded especially at breakfast time i do not appreciate vaporisers sprayer that you smell everywhere in my opinion very artificial very limited window opening not possible to get much fresh air in my room was very quiet but if you get a room from oxford street site i suppose it may be quite noisy when i stayed there 2 lifts were broken out of 4 so it was a long time waiting we stayed 6th or 7th floor 
 very minor thing but the windows were needing a clean the hotel is situated on a busy road so dirt has to be expected and for all i know the window cleaners may have been scheduled for the next day 
 bathroom need to shower in bath tub
 feature shower in the room shame it s not separate
 not co operation expensive i waited for 7 hours without my luggage in temporary room without any appreciation or apologize or compensation 
 need some better toiletries in the shower
 the only milk provided was whole milk and the breakfast tea provided and served was unpalatable 
 very expensive breakfast for what it was
 room in desperate need of refurbishment particularly the bathroom 
 no complaints but not as luxurious as other hotels we ve stayed at for a similar price
 that my package not include the breakfast
 car parking rate was exspensive
 nothing excellent location and comfortable hotel 
 my only negative is how warm hot the rooms get how noisy the air con is 
 no air con had to change rooms late at night rooms tired and need upgrading poor decor breakfast was very poor coffee from a flask very poor value for money at 127 quid per night 
 you can t turn down the air conditioning but there isn t really a reason to 
 uncomfortable beds room too hot windows don t open car parking system is enter your reg no at reception and pay for the number of days you re staying the problem is trying to extend the duration you either have to pay at a machine coins only or pay by phone which entails setting up an account and giving some anonymous person your bank details in the end i left and parked in west india quay for half the price 
 the room we booked wasn t available for the 2 nights so we were allocated a higher grade room for the first night and then changed to the one we booked slightly inconvenient 
 we found the railway a little noisy but the hotel quiet
 no coffee for coffee maker in the room
 ordered room service just after midnight after having a shower as we d been out at 02 only to be told that we d need to come down to pay for it so got dressed to go down and pay food arrived stone cold they pinged it in the microwave rather than cook fresh getting dressed to go down and pay is not like any room service i have ever had before
 nothing bad
 the room was too cold on arrival and fact that the restaurant only opened certain times of the day 
 th water flowed over in toilet nobody try to fix it even cleaner doesnt care
 noise from outside in the early hours but then thats also the area 
 heat in the room
 price of breakfast to expensive for us
 location is easy for transport but hospital and university is across the road creating loud street noise 
 self check in failed again 
 i should have requested an orthopaedic mattress as i found the bed too soft for my comfort next time i will ask if they could provide that 
 air con in the room struggling to make any difference to temperature also extractor fan in the bathroom struggling to move any air roof terrace it is a lovely roof terrace should be open to guests to relax on with a book or notepad during the daytime when the bar is not open it is accessible to guests only from 5 00 on when the bar opens 
 the size was too small 
 our room was underground and without windows 
 the shower flooded our room rooms were smaller than expected
 having to use the boat
 room
 food after hours was terrible the staff were not helpful in fact i found the reception staff to be very dismissive 
 n a
 rooms service
 nothing
 wifi only works well in lobby doesn t work properly in upper floor rooms there was an expo at those dates so rates could be better 
 room on top floor had air conditioning which was a bit noisy
 hotel needs to be updated bedroom very small and basic
 very small room
 poor lighting in bedroom 
 nothing
 the bed was small short and the room was either freezing or boiling 
 requested they chose us a nice room if you stood on a box looked through the window we had a brick wall plus the rooms in general were just modern city centre hotel cells 
 paying for wifi
 no fridge in room road at front noisy
 all good
 the bathroom was old fashioned shower never got very hot and the toilet was brown at the bottom of the bowl very bad no bath mat and the floor was marble so dangerous as was slippy the bar prices extortionate 20 for 2 glasses of house wine and the audacity to add 2 service charge we got drinks at the bar they were not served to us breakfast adequate 
 once i ve noticed during a breakfast that eggs benedict bun was burnt but it didn t happen again 
 small room small shower
 the mattress was too soft the bathroom was peeled
 nothing to complaint about 
 had trouble with free wifi kept dropping out eventually staff connected me at no cost did not like the television 
 a bit more time in the sauna half an hour wasn t enough for us
 the bathroom is designed only to accommodate a very slim person i had a problem with my door lock and was locked out for over an hour until it was fixed i also had a problem with my safe and it took a very long time to get it opened by the maintenance the breakfast are was nice however the buffet breakfast really not well organized at all there were very few items on the buffet only bread and croissant juice if you wanted something different you had to ask for it but since there was only one person serving the breakfast area it took a long time to receive whatever you would order pity for otherwise nice boutique hotel 
 no view from my room
 the lication far from domo
 room small bathroom very small 
 business trip wifi connection was very poor 
 bedroom was in need of refurbishment carpet worn and overall feel of room was jaded 
 that i only stayed for one night
 disliked the goldfish bowl bathroom glass door and glass panel in the partition wall afforded no privacy
 our bed was not made so when we went out we ask that it be changed from two doubles into the super king which it should have been in the first place when we got back the bed was not done i called down and they sent someone up to do it which left us feeling very awkward sitting in our room watching them make the bed not the sort of service you expect to be forgotten about in a high end hotel 
 tired floral beige corridor carpets let it down a bit rather stained n marked in areas wrong base colour for heavy traffic areas 
 nothing could of been better 
 had to ask 3 times for tea when waiting for breakfast
 nothing
 would have liked robes already in room bath taps very complicated to use hotel bar very noisy nowhere quiet to sit 
 the late checking in was confusing as you have to read your email for instructions to figure it out 
 lack of eye contact and greeting from some staff on entry incorrect information by male assistant on desk which led to wrong time for meal 
 expensive no breakfast
 pillows were a bit hard
 we booked a room with a photo of a bath but no bath was in our room we complained are were upgraded to an even better room than the one we booked with a bath very very pleased 
 rooms much too small particular public at tea time
 we forgot a bag our own fault of course but they could have called us instead of waiting for us to contact them then we wouldn t have to drive back three hours they did help afterwards though thank you 
 rooms relatively small lift access difficult at peak times
 the room why marble was cracked and stained and looked dirty
 the breakfast selection is amazing however the cost is outrageous 21 50 per person for breakfast is crazy if we had more time we would not have eaten there due to price 
 the shower rose squirted everywhere need repair the chambermaid let another person into our room to use the toilet we arrived back she was cleaning room an unknown to us female person appeared we were compensated with s bottle of wine 
 how far from city centre
 regular rooms are very small
 mini bar and drinks in the bar were too expensive 
 breakfast is good but very expensive the evening guy on the reception was too busy to serve also in the bar 
 the hotel wasn t cheap at all and the breakfast can be improved but it s so centraly placed that for us it was worth the money 
 however there was one huge thing missing for me and that was tea and coffee making facilities part of enjoying a break away for me is making a morning coffee in the room and snuggling back in bed with news channel on instead i had to get up get dressed and go down in the lift to the canteen in reception pay a fiver for a tea and coffee and take them back to the room which rather defeated the object if we stay there again which we probably will i will take my own travel kettle and coffee supplies 
 we arrived at 4pm told we could check in at 3pm and the rooms were not ready they gave us an upgrade to an apartment this was not a good location right on the edge of the red light district not that good with a family we stay at this hotel a few years ago and it was fantastic now it it just living on its name we were all disappointed with it when we were expected 5 
 
 great for its proximity to the nou camp stadium for the football but a little too far out of the centre of barcelona and ideally could have been more central
 the room was a bit small but for one night it was fine if i were staying for a week or more it would be a little too small 
 all great until the last day where it was only one problem that happened where i was disrespected by a staff and no one bothered even to apologise even though the manager was extremely close and im sure she knew about it
 gym a bit small
 staff efficient but not particularly friendly location is nice but not as central as many other hotels
 we were not advised before travelling by either booking com or the hotel that there is an ongoing refurbishment of the whole hotel noise of drilling and hammering started just after 7am on the first morning and when we complained to the manager we found that they were drilling out a metre of concrete in the basement to fit in a crane the facilities are somewhat limited at present with no real residents lounge just some chairs in the lobby the location could not be more central but because all the tour coaches drop off and pick up outside it is often difficult to make your way through the crowds standing outside to actually get to the hotel door 
 too noisy i could hear doors slamming conversations in neighbouring rooms toilets flushing hard to get to sleep as a result room size was small ish but the bathroom was ridiculously small could only close the door if you stood in one exact spot 
 very expensive restaurant the cleaning staff knocked the door too early in the morning 
 the fact that i could not stay longer 
 pricing is a bit high
 the fire alarm went off at 2 am then noisy renovation going on in the morning but we weren t there to sleep 
 no good restaurants nearby that i could see
 nothing to not like really the rooms are basic but still great value and comfortable 
 slow at reception 
 nothing 
 the side facing the road is a bit noisy the position of the tv in my room is a bit odd the angle is wrong for sitting down 
 poor service lots of issues with room a water leak in the ceiling bath tub didn t drain very noisy the room rate quoted changed daily bad expensive breakfast 
 i think breakfast it was expensive enough not too much variety the quality of coffee was poor enough there is no small tefrigarator in the room and the bath foam bottle was empty for 3 days 
 quite expensive overall with breakfast parking fees etc taken into account it s located in a business industry park which is less than ideal for 90 of tourists we will spend our money elsewhere next time 
 ac would have been nice with daily temps of 39 degrees reasonably comfortable with supplied fans 
 a bigger parking area perhaps
 room charge from restaurant could be lower
 the room was too small and water pressure abysmal and having to pay for wi fi even though staff offered a voucher if i became a member and even then the speed was too slow i wouldn t rebook unless they had free wi fi with faster download speeds
 air conditioning was not very effective 
 the rooms are quiet dated and the beds arent the most comfortable they also move 
 lack of mirrors one in the bathroom and one inside the cupboard door except when the cupboard was open there was little space to stand in let alone dry your hair a full length mirror on a spare wall by the door would ve been great not sure i m thrilled on staff wearing jeans as their uniform though they do have white shirts waistcoats with them 
 irritating need to use your room key to activate the lift understandable from a security point of view but if several people get in at once not so secure anyway 
 bed was too small bathroom was so small that the shower was very difficult to get in
 the spa was disappointing a very small sauna and steam room and only 1 out of 3 showers working properly i expected something a bit better matching the rest of the hotel
 it was outdated the chairs in the entry were dirty i would not sit on them 
 i didn t like the lack of an elevator in the area that i stayed but staff was extremely helpful with luggage not a big problem at all if your able to do stairs 
 i thought it was excellent they did have a rooftop honor bar that you helped yourself and wrote down what you took and your room would be charged i did think the alcohol prices were high drinks much cheaper if you went to local bars and restaraunts 
 had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit at 340 for our 2 night stay i didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room i have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had there was a bath too i am only 5 feet tall and i couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense the bed was comfortable everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall will not return here 
 hotel didn t take online payment and i was forced to pay via credit card on arrival incurring heafty 3 additional charges from the hotel themselves as well as from my bank given how small the rooms are albeit well designed the hotel is overpriced 
 expensive food in restaurant especially for children 
 floor in room could have been a little cleaner for my liking crawling baby but i am quite particular at the moment e g make sure the floor just under bed is also tidy 
 our room was in between floors so that although we could use the elevator to take our bags upstairs i had to carry them 12 stairs to the room itself strange setup avoid room 307 there were other rooms the same on other floors 
 nothing as hotels go it was pretty perfect and we will be back next september for sure
 a little bit overpriced it s a good 3 star hotel not quite 4 star 
 breakfast for two was 40 euro the bar in hotel is tiny
 the location was a little away from centre but marginal so not a problem and a nice walk to waterloo 
 pricey but that s barcelona for you
 nothing
 nothing it was perfect
 nothing
 the view from the rear window on the ground floor was restricted
 we was asked 400 when we arrived for deposit we wasn t told this when we booked we didn t bring our credit cards with us just money we end up using our friends credit card bit embarrassing 
 parking but not essential 
 breakfast was too expensive 29 i like the breakfast buffet concept instead of a men that i have to choose and wait i was there for business and i had to wait a bit instead of being able to pick up what i considered despite the brakfast was great as well 
 could not figure out how to play own much through the sound sysstem not sure if its possible 
 we asked for a room in the morning because we had an early morning flight the staff said that there s no room and we should wait that s fair since there s a standard check in time we sat at the lobby when we saw two families arrive and check in successfully it surprised me so i went to ask the staff for a room pointing out that the families checked in before us only after that we immediately were offered a room it was a bit strange to be honest 
 we endured two hours of unbearable heat in our room reception failed to answer phone for ninety minutes resulting in ringing radios son main booking number to get someone turned out there was no water in the air con but by then we were exhausted with sinus and breathing pains headaches for a day lovely designed room with very poor lighting room service good but general care awful only way to get to o2 is taxi and difficult to get back 
 not enough lights whole room was dark
 very very very thin walls i could hear the person next door on the toilet and full conversations a private party so unable to use terrace bar which one of the reasons for choosing this hotels rather than others in the area also went to the bar at 11 15pm to be told it was closed and we d have to wait for night staff not sure why they couldn t cross over so no disruption to guests 
 i left a watch in the room and housekeeping claim not to have found it not cool 
 all ok apart from breakfast not delivered
 very old furnitures especially the sofa and the utensils
 rooms are really close to cramped 
 although the food in the restaurant represented quite good value for london it appeared a little thrown together we sampled breakfast and dinner we returned a room service sandwich as there was no chicken in the chicken mayonnaise they did exchange it for another but it did underline the sloppy kitchen service not a fan of big screen televisions and pop music when trying to enjoy a meal in the restaurant as if the busy streets of london weren t enough excitement already it can get very busy and cramped immediately outside the hotel as there is a continuous flow of travellers often with suitcases exiting victoria station 
 while this hotel tries very hard to have a cool modern minimalist look what might look nice in photos does not translate to a very good experience in the room i m afraid the biggest let down was the almost complete lack of soundproofing between the room and common areas atrium i could hear the lobby muzak the conversations of people waiting for the elevator and the screaming of the kids using the pool six floors up through my closed door not good additionally voices and footsteps from neighbouring units were very audible as i am a light sleeper i had to use ear plugs during the night also the use of semi transparent glass walls and doors between the bathroom and toilet section in the middle of the room and the kitchen and sleeping areas is of questionable taste i think the bathroom cubicle itself was supposed to have closing glass doors but the panels didnt want to move on their sliders anymore small niggles there was no place to hang your towels to dry after showering the tv remote only worked with the small screen in the kitchen the rooftop terrace could have been very nice if they luxed it up a bit with a bar and someone in attendance but as it was when i was there it was in effect a kindergarden full of screaming kids who in essence occupied the whole area a bit of attention from the staff would make it possible for other guests to enjoy the facilities too in all i was expecting something a bit more luxurious than what was provided and in particular the feeling of a lack of privacy lets this hotel down in my opinion 
 there were 3 a c units in the room but it seemed as though only 1 was working and it was not very effective the room was bearable temperature wise but not as cool as we would have liked 
 as in most hotels there was only one chair in a double room we would have liked two after our first night we went out during the morning returning around 3 30pm to find the room hadn t been cleaned i was told they would send someone but i stated after 5pm as we were resting before a night out they came twice before 5pm 
 sadly breakfast was poor for all 3 days cold bacon and sausage which were horrible anyway 
 the bed was nice and big however it was 2 mattresses put together and quite uncomfortable for a couple to sleep on if i wanted to sleep in a separate bed i would have booked a twin the parking i said was a bonus has an extremely cunning system they have an overnight rate of 15 but the catch is you have to leave the car park by 9am the luxury of parking your car until checkout which is only 2 hours later will cost you an extra 6 which i thought was a little excessive 
 the bed was awful not comfortable at all i was able to have an electric kettle for the room but wasn t allowed to take a cup from reception so despite being allowed a kettle in the room was given nothing to make a hot drink the wi fi was very poor with often limited or no coverage 
 the temperature was too hot when we were ther
 to much differences of the 160 and 120 rooms
 room service staff woke me up at 2230 to collect tray even though do not disturb sign on door 
 room decor a bit outdated but that s just the style they are perfectly modern 
 no ice room very small 
 not enough milk in the room
 the size of the room very small with only one chair long waiting before check in and late chicken is very pricey no good view very poor wifi
 drinks were quite expensive but probably about normal for hotels in barcelona pool and gym were a little small 
 after i booked and requested a smoking room booking forgot to inform that pestana hotel is not a smoking hotel and it almost cost me 150 pounds and i only paid 115 pounds for the room itself
 check in took too long but otherwise fine 
 one miss was no belt for robe for all days
 we booked in room breakfast and sauna and both where forgotten about 
 noting 
 breakfast eggs not very good
 room with no view but when booking request one that overlooks the los ramblas street i wish id have done
 poor house keeping
 some street noise the windows do not keep that outside 
 room could have used an update breakfast was inordinately expensive i was charged 5 50 for toast in british pounds when i had ordered eggs a la carte eggs tea and toast 28 pounds no juice no extras plus gratuity i am used to 5 star hotels but i felt thjis was out of range
 no breakfast in the price lower ground floor so lots of noise above
 my single room was very small but adequate for a one night stay at least it had a good en suite floor standing air conditioning unit was very noisy and could not open window as tube from unit went out through window so window was fixed shut however it was very effective in cooling the room quickly on a very hot london day but you would not want it on all night did not sleep very well due to poor quality of pillows one was thin and hard the other very lumpy i did bring this to the attention of the receptionist when i checked out and she said she would change the lumpy one very unusual to see a sign in bathroom saying not to drink tap water and had to pay 2 for a bottle of water if tap water not drinkable i think hotel should provide a bottle of water in room wallpaper rather faded and could do with updating 
 it raises your expectations so going back to a supposedly 4 star hotel the next day was a bit of a bummer 8 
 they provided tea coffee and kettle then charged 2 33 for a small jug of milk 
 loved it all apart from the fact that food wise i felt they should have had a bit more of an option for halal food which was just a slight issue but still not too bad x
 staff where good but lack initiative when it came to tourist information 
 on 2 occasions on making up our room either the glasses were left as the previous night with drink still in them and also the tea and coffee was not replaced so had none the next morning when we went to look 
 rooms are not well insulated you can hear the noise outside coming from oxford street their bed mattresses are terrible and not comfortable at all also they gave me the corner room which does not have enough space and very congested
 nothing everything excellent
 can t think of anything
 the room it was very little and with definitely not a 4 stars room very old floor and door the hotel shows pictures of a new renovated hotel with new renovated rooms but that was not the reality wifi is only offered in the lobby otherwise costs 10 
 quite small rooms
 n a
 walls very thin tv are directly mounted on the walls last night of stay had to call desk to ask neighbor to turn down tv could hear entire tv show 
 had some minor trouble finding the entrance and getting the automatic door to open when i first arrived really really minor annoyance 
 first of all i should say that i m a genius member of booking com and in the hotel s features i read that they offer 2 hours early and late check in and check out respectively but when i arrived to hotel and i was extremely exhausted they told me they do not know any thing about it and i stayed almost 3 4 hours in lobby for my room secondly i paid cash and i paid all the price of the hotel 5nights in check in and they took a guaranty fee as usual but i was in other hotels also parisian hotels and i m aware of guaranty fee they charged me 800 for 5 nights 2 rooms it s so much thirdly the reception forgot to give me back my exchange money 2 times and always i was like i think you should give me moreover the range of breakfast options was not too much compared to the hotel s stars generally speaking i was in at least 5 novotel hotels but it s the worst 
 would have liked a room with a view 
 when we arrived there where no footpaths or even roads we had to walk through a building site a jcb nearly reversed over us and my new shoes that u paid 80 for the day before where tollaly ruined the staff on desk said it wasn t there fault you as a hotel have a duty of care towards your guest and could have put up signage so your guests had a clear and safe footpath to access the hotel in total i ruined two good pair of shoes and could not believe that the hotel thought it was exceptable to have no signage or clear footpath for there guests it s also not a ten minute walk to central it s over 50 min walk and 10 min on the bus
 no complimentary water inside the room plain of toilets amenities
 nothing
 pillows were uncomfortable building work outside
 walk in shower remains very wet after shower which results in walking in water when returning to bathroom 
 bathroom needs upgrading a bit tired looking 
 swimming pool not available and room view facing interior patio area 
 my stay ha ha
 everything the hotel should be torn down and re built
 front desk staff was great
 not much choice of restaurants in the area
 distance from tube station breakfast on the expensive side bar understaffed at busy times 
 rooms are too small and windows are not isolated so you ear all noises from the square even at late hours
 decor a little bit old but facilities works fine wifi is a bit slow 
 corridors are a bit lifeless
 cracked sink no fridge and no hairdryer have complained 
 had to pay in full at check in they would not accept a ore authorisation on my credit card strang for a hotel if this standard room was a bit small but ok room had an odour air con was a bit noisy 
 couldn t check in early even though requested before arrival
 phone not working tv remote dirty and not fully functional tight space in room only stairs 
 nil 
 waited for 1 5 hour for check in after 2pm the time of check in no one even offered us water or coffee or said they were sorry for the delay we were late for a meeting and needed to freshen up before that when we got the room it smelled like poop diapers 
 the only thing stopping me rating the hotel a 10 is that there was no free wifi
 the ventilator is loud but it was shut down at night the staff is not very friendly and asked me to wait for my luggage for a long time 
 room seemed a bit basic for the cost 
 something has gone wrong the rooms were not as clean as normal and maintenance seems to have stopped not good broken toilet and dirty shower and both really easy to fix come on management you are spoiling a good hotel 
 building work being done on hotel so lots of noise
 no pool but it was mantioned on description 
 restaurant no bread rolls on the table or asked if we required no water on table or offered we had to ask no spoons on the table had to be asked when soup and dessert brought to table 
 the seating in the room could have been better there was 1 chair and a stool other than that you had to sit on the bed 
 fancy shower but no pressure on the water so we could barely take an ordinary shower very small room well it s in central london very small elevator 
 small room
 room and bathroom were tiny could barely towel myself in the bathroom without hitting my elbows had to sit sideways on the toilet due to highly inadequate leg room 
 nothing 
 we reported that the bed was rather hard uncomfortable and noisy which detracted from our stay somewhat however i had an email at home waiting for me from the manager saying they were looking into this problem thanking us for the comment and offering a free upgrade on our next visit also to contact him direct with email address just before we arrived and he would ensure all was ok for us 
 check in and check out took a long time room cost was charged to our credit card even though i said i wanted to pay in cash room was very hot as couldn t use air conditioning because it was too noisy i advised at the time of booking that it was my 25th wedding anniversary but we weren t given anything complimentary 
 it s the worst 4 star hotel i stayed in in my whole life the hotel is full of insects and it s to old and dirty and used
 wifi not working properly no signal for the mobile in the room room extremely small no shower just hand shower
 i would have preferred to be closer to city center but the transportation was very convenient and easy 
 would have liked tea coffee making facilities in the room as there was a well stocked mini bar
 not a thing
 nothing 
 rooms have no view and it is very noisy inside the hotel dark room with no sunlight
 disappointed with breakfast eggs that should have been hot were cold 
 this place is awful the carpet was about 30 years old with stains everywhere the walls were paper thin to hear my neighbors having sex the hotel was unable to produce a receipt and said the had to email it but i have yet to receive 
 sometimes too noisy but not from outside from the street but from hotel inner places and next room front doors and walls very not very isolated 
 the rooftop bar was closed for renovation 
 cleaning service left a dirty cup on our room coming back at about 11pm wanting to order a drink at the bar barman stressed and waiter stressed very busy and not enough staff not their fault they need more staff 
 space in room was limited with stroller etc 
 the staff was very unfriendly and we were not made to feel welcome check in and check out is from a computer while this is convenient it s not the same thing as being greeted and made to feel welcome whenever we needed to ask a question about anything during our stay the staff was almost rude and not friendly at all we are planning a return to amsterdam and i doubt we would stay at this hotel again due to the staff 
 room looked onto public courtyard curtains had to be closed constantly kettle for tea and coffee would have been appreciated
 we were up in top rooms very hot and air conditioning didnt work plus double bed was against wall so access was a pain changed room and much morw friendly room but again air con no good
 breakfast has changed making hot items ordered charged separately rather than part of the buffet like they were before 
 not having breakfast included in the price although it was offered for 14 95 that is a lot for a bowl of cereal and some toast 
 the price for breakfast could be cheaper 
 an out of the city center hotel like this should offer free parking the 8 eur that are charged here per 24 hours are not devastating but it s more of a principle matter 
 for the value daily price there was nothing to dislike 
 systems down lift broken allocated at room via the app then given a room 3 floors above at the front
 the weather
 rooms very small
 car parking fee to high
 nothing
 it is not problem of hotel it is problem of milano in the evenings everywhere is full of mosquito hold some medicine with you for the bites 
 none
 bar prices seemed a little high 
 breakfast not uncluded cost 
 pretty much everything was fine by me 
 we weren t informed that we would be in a different location to the main building and the breakfast we had just paid for was therefore 10 minutes walk away not a problem if we had known that because we were in a different building the pictures of the rooms were nothing like those on the website which are of the main building the sister location isn t that far away but the standard of accommodation is far below that of the main building including though not limited to single pane sash windows which needed a piece of 4x4 to stay open heating on full blast and no fan we were also not informed that we would be in a different location when we booked in and paid for a breakfast when we called reception to complain we were told that we had not specified any special requirements in our booking however after a discussion they managed to find a room for us in the main building 
 nothing
 the room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet the room was hot and we could only open the windows about 2 inches 
 none
 the pool wasn t working so i could only use the sauna 
 the reception staff are expected to do a lot reception concierge and sorting everything out in between the reception did not seem to have enough staff this meant long waits the staff handled it exceptionally well but it was frustrating at times our check in took 15 minutes we personally did not like the concept of the bathroom in the bedroom but that is a personal choice the pillows were uncomfortable as so flat 
 nothing 
 cleaning need order
 stand in line at breakfast to get coffee really too long
 room
 it didn t serve alcohol
 same as all the elevators in old building small slow
 prefer walk in shower rather than shower within bath 
 nothing
 the smell in my room smelled like chinese cuisine
 breakfast very poor value for money 
 paid wifi poor
 the only thing we found was that the fried breakfast could have been warmer by the time we sat down to eat it it had gone cold
 breakfast buffet overpriced 19 for the quality 
 they double booked one of our rooms
 not conveniently located up hill and many stairs from nearest metro located in questionable area where felt unsafe at night rooms were so small no room for toilet bag in shower dated and dim lite rooms 
 kind of a hike to the nearest metro stop like 8 blocks also the mattresses were thin with very basic bedding 
 tired old room very different to the advertising poor sound proofing from lift shaft hallways and road outside knackered old furniture won t be staying here again
 we got back to the hotel at 23 oo hours and the bar was closed which found strange for a london hotel
 hotel was not clean the room was too small not enough room to hang clothes only one chair lighting poor also no light above mirror 
 being on my own i found it a bit annoying that when i went to get something else from the buffet staff had cleared my table for someone else this happened on two occasions also the tables weren t wiped after use 
 small lift room was large but furnishing rather uncomfortable
 my bed was single and twin
 nothing special
 fairly small room with not much storage for clothes very odd window from the bedroom into the bathroom this had a blind but didn t quite cover not very private when you are trying to use the loo on a romantic break away 
 can t think of any 
 didn t like having to use 2 separate elevators to get to room wifi could be better breakfast should be part of the rate too expensive at almost 20 euros per person i can just get breakfast outside 
 bedroom a little too small but we managed the breakfast could have been free if we had booked directly too late for us during breakfast we were on the last minute and too many staff were hovering around us clearing tables and obviously anxious for us to leave 
 staff said everything right but it was unconvincing no eye contact only responded to direct questions aptitude fine attitude needs work 
 bar a bit loud
 single room might be bigger
 facilities have problems too frequently eg wifi and chargers and fire alarm 6 am in the morning 
 room service is not very good 
 checking in was very slow with queues housekeeping took towels etc but did not replace them staff gave no information about the hotel facilities when checking in no local tourist information avaliable 
 unfortunately the hotel is very busy and early check in was not a possibility for us as in all paris hotels the classic room was quite small 
 most of staff spoke english well just one young woman of oriental ethnicity was difficult to understand due to poor standard of english are staff encouraged to go for lessons 
 coffees and teas could be more freely available with everything else at breakfast instead of having to ask and wait 
 couldn t connect to the wi fi from laptop only worked through phone or tablet small elevator 
 no tea available in room checks on who we were ie should we be there poor view from room
 no info provided in foyer or bedroom re maps things and places to see brochures
 my room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience 
 tiny room had to squeeze past between end of bed and wall to move round room 
 the hotel was further out than i would have liked but good transport links would also have liked a bar to have a relax in after a full day out as a alchol free hotel ididnt realise this when i booked we were not even allowed a glass of wine in our room 
 bar was closed when we were there 
 poor wifi i could not work 
 no tea coffee making set in room provided 
 as a treat we tend to like to order breakfast up to the room but this isn t an option at this hotel which is a shame 
 to have to pay for wifi
 the safety box is very small and the door of the room is with key is better open with card and most of the staff don t talk english 
 rooms weren t cleaned properly everyday and very late in the afternoon
 nothing 
 the discretionary service charge as it wasn t optional it was automatically deducted initially they didn t have a twin room as requested when i booked after a bit of back and forth to reception we eventually got sorted 
 don t get stuck here late in the evening if you want any type of food drink atmosphere local life transport reason to live there is no purpose for this hotel it is a room overlooking a motorway on a rainy winter s evening looking out from your room onto the concrete barren any european city hinterland that surrounds you it is like something from an 80 s john le carre novel without the intrigue 
 the breakfast tea was not very hot asked for a second pot which was just as bad some of the items like bacon were cooked to a crisp 
 one of us same family had forgotten her identity card and they didn t want to let us in it was 10 pm and the room was already paid for 
 room was not great at all had much better rooms in the past gym should be free for 100 plus bookings you should give this find thought 
 the breakfast though i like it was a little expensive compared to other hotels in the city 
 
 nothing excellent hotel 
 had to wait for the room even though we were told that the room would be ready at 2pm waiting caused us to be late for our appointment we were offered to have a drink at the bar while we waited which was subsequently charged to the room from previous experience i would have expected this to be complementary 
 compared to the 2 other places i stayed on this trip in london it was double the price and i was in the basement with little light and no panache 
 the bed was very soft felt like going to roll off edges
 low light at the rooms
 shower drainage was quite slow water floods when we shower 
 dark corridors
 n a
 parking should be for free and better transportation to the train station one car is not enough pleasa give us slippers 
 the roof terrace wasnt what we d expected no bar just a telephone to order from downstairs
 no parking at hotel but nearby in multi storey
 staff not particularly helpful car parking not explained police arrest in reception on saturday morning 
 room service food not that bad but a bit microwaved 
 the minibar wasn t stocked properly at 5 30 every morning a crow would wake us up by trying to open the door on the terrace the check out time was too early for a
 not a big fan of buffet breakfasts but there was a wide choice and the staff would go get anything else 
 nothing
 no tooth brush 
 nothing 
 late night call from housekeeping asking if the room needed cleaning at 9 50pm 
 breakfast was poor
 room was great but a bit dusty 
 it was a bit pricey for one night
 the look of the hotel from outside
 nothing 
 if i have to find fault it would just be that the finish of the wooden bath panel was rather aged and the bathroom sliding door does not close flush to the door so there isn t proper privacy it s these little finishes that you would certainly expect to be of the highest standard from a room that would ordinarily be charged at 485 
 the furniture wasn t very new but the room was very clean and neat 
 room service works from 5 11 pm only nespresso machine without capsules 
 nothing
 the water not draining in the bathroom sink 
 the mattress was very hard and didn t suit us which meant we had a poor night sleep there wasn t enough tea coffee etc and it was an inconvenience to go to reception to ask for it and then wait on someone bringing it would have preferred proper glasses instead of plastic cups 
 second visit our room was tiny so would request larger room next time
 poor wifi signal
 i wish they had a mini fridge that s was the only con to the hotel room 
 bathroom needs refreshing i wanted myself to buy a 5 euro box of grout and do it myself 
 room had no view other than the rooftop the extractor fans air conditioning units on roof above room were very noisy led to a disturbed sleep room had several dead insects moths on floor suggesting a cleanliness issue 
 need better breakfast room facility needs improvement of lift facility either an extra onewhich would be preferable or a faster one need better towel hooks in shower room
 not much around in that location you could hear doors slamming and people walking by the room 
 room a bit small
 breakfast not included and was very expensive food not great was sitting in the restaurant bar area and had my phone stolen there were no other people around other than staff reported this but no luck tried to add extra nights stay on and they wanted 300 twice as much wouldn t budge even though i am a regular customer and had booked 4 nights in a row already had to get another hotel across town 
 isolation of rooms are not too god and you can hear your neighbour without any problem
 the hotel
 wireless network was not good
 no bad experience frindely staff
 given a twin room but the beds were double so it was fine 
 dated rooms slow wi fi not a clean as expected
 the room was quite dark 
 wifi does not work 
 only one restaurant open drinks a little pricey
 good location
 whilst only a short stroll to the ramblas there were some dubious characters at night didn t spoil it however
 refill of cosmetics in the bathroom should have been done for 2 since it was a double room everything was ok when we asked for it 
 no mirror near hairdryer
 some confusion about how to access wireless internet connection staff had to intervene and did so successfully 
 nothing
 slightly small room 
 bathroom incredibly bad not even 2 stars worth
 size of the rooms no tv
 nothing
 nothing
 you can t rent movies
 the bed wasn t the comfiest that i ve slept in although i suspect that this is down to personal preferences 
 some staff members made me feel uncomfortable as if we weren t the type of people they wanted staying with them
 walking to the passage to get ice
 far too expensive for an ordinary hotel the bathroom was minute and the shower even more so and i am a slim person 
 fitness room is open 10 22h i arrived after 22 and had to check out around 8am so i had no chance to see it it should work 24 7 really i did not like the idea of extra charge for the kitchen utensils because it is possible to get a dinner for about the same price i did not like the shower curtain a shower panel glass would be much nicer considering the rest of the hotel the croissants could have been better 
 maybe another spare electric socket in the room
 the room smell very bad the towels were old and hard the whole floor reeked of the smell of sewage around the hotel construction work noisy rooms facing the main road is very noisy and can not sleep in them after a sleepless night we were transferred to a quieter room 
 we were beautifully looked after and nearby building works did not cause us any noise or inconvenience 
 room was quite worn out
 the dinning room was far to hot hope this is sorted when full renovation is completed
 all good 
 wifi didn t work properly
 extremely impolite personnel particularly in the restaurant room not propely cleaned room in serious need of refurbishment 
 breakfast was appalling
 besides butter there could be flora for any one who doesn t like butter for instance although it is a small hotel buffet breakfast could be helpful 
 minimal choice of hot food for breakfast
 terrible room service twice they forgot towels and soap in the fridge there was a used bottle of water they didn t charge us alhtough we told reception twice to change it they didnt pay attention a lady with short black hair in the reception is not helpfull one night when we came back we found the key of our room outside the door forgotten all the day by the room service and no towels soap in the room unacceptable to charge for the parking 8 euros per day there was no hotel bus for the metro station although it is in the facilities there were ants in the room bus 423 from san siro metro station to hotel stops at 20 20 o clock on sunday there is no service of that line and you have to pay 13 euros taxi or to take 80 bus and walk about 20 minutes in the dark countryside to reach hotel 
 price of breakfast we ate out instead
 1 the hotel opened in december 2015 and our room still smells refurbishment my husband had a minor headache you should think twice if you are sensitive about such smells 2 the decoration is claimed to be modern if you call simple as modern and they actually look cheap this is just a personal opinion of course 3 very poor choices of breakfast considering the price in comparison with any other 4 star hotel you may see the photos 4 poor maintenance you won t believe but they indeed only have one guy for housekeeping on friday 5 poor facilities our king sized bed is actually combined by two single beds our air conditioning didn t work nor did the neighbor s no table in the room washing counter is made of board instead of marble 6 staff are actually ok but the management is a mess we couldn t bear the smell so after negotiating and waiting the reception said we can cancel the other 2 nights and get refund when we check out we called booking com and booking com talked to the hotel for confirmation and changed the reservation from 3 nights to 1 so that we can get refund properly but when we checked out the next morning another staff on shift said she needed reconfirmation and then we waited for three days and nobody from the hotel contacted us when we called the hotel again they said they wouldn t refund us i don t understand if they said they couldn t refund we wouldn t check out in the first place booking com staff are very professional and have been contacting the hotel to get us the refund as the hotel promised we are still waiting i couldn t believe this is a 4 star hotel where is the honesty and integrity everything i described here has recording as proof 5 i chose this hotel because of those good reviews but other than the location i don t think this hotel is of good value for money at all i booked it at an average rate of 200 euros by the way 
 the artwork was trying a bit too hard to be funky
 the room allocated should ve been described to us by the staff as some of the facilities were different to what we expected
 reception service could be friendlier provided a european union id card upon arrival and wasn t accepted had to retrieve the passport this is a schengen country so no need to present passport at the airport let alone a hotel 
 the bed was the firmest of our whole trip to the point of uncomfortable no spare pillows to help but staff got some sort us 
 too much charge for an additional bed you can not cancell the resevation but only to accept this incredible charge it s like a rob 100 
 very poor mattress i couldn t sleep all night because of the mattress my room number was 303
 poor view considering location
 rooms are not well maintained carpets are not clean look more like 3 stars hotel not 4
 none
 the toiletries in the room were very basic and mine were not topped up so i had no shower gel shampoo don t rely on theirs bring your own also the mini bar only had 2 bottles of water in there which i used in the first day and these were not replaced on subsequent days 
 it was extremely noisey in and outside the hotel bin men came at 2 30am
 carpet
 directions and signage to rooms possibly slightly cleaner bar shuts early 
 there were no faults
 nothing to complain about
 small room needed a little spring clean not sure what i got extra for booking a deluxe room
 nothing 
 nothing 
 nothing 
 i needed to print my boarding pass for my journey but the facilities were a bit primitive staff were helpful and friendly though had originally booked a single room but found it too cramped and being on the top floor it was very hot fortunately they were able to give me a upgraded room by paying a bit extra 
 very bad wifi
 breakfast could propose more sofisticated food we had apples boiled eggs toasts and dry cakes 
 the bathroom had no space for my cosmetics i had to drag a chair in and there was a shower curtain which is a no no but i had not time to complain and removed it myself 
 nothing there was a metro station right outside we could not have asked for more paris map provided on arrival it was much better than we were expecting 
 desperately in need of redecoration batbroom particularly bad and dangerous my girlfriend slipped in the shower due to it having a smooth surface and no slip mat she cut her leg and is bruised despite complaining we have had no response from tbe hotel
 nothing
 the shower is tiny the shower curtain keep sticking to my arm during the shower 
 noisy neighbours cold food and drink at breakfast
 bed was a little hard no windows we could open 
 it would be nice to have bottled water in the room
 room was dated and worn well used howerver was comfortable
 ground floor room g08 was noisy from the outside and the inside aircon was quite noisy too i don t think i got any of the genius perks but as i was only staying briefly i didn t query it
 breakfast was too expensive for the quality quantity ive slept on a better bed before 
 a lot of road noise
 room size small couldn t walk round one side of the bed
 we didn t like the fact that although we asked for a twin room with canal view we given a double room we really had to stretch our necks to see the canal which actually ran along the end of the road we complained and were offered a twin room but no canal view no reduction in price therefore low value for money score 
 concierge was very hard to reach not very helpful not the best attitude no follow ups borederline going to shout at them
 nothing
 location a bit out of the main shopping district
 no pool no integrated spa could be more clean in the rooms
 the staff were not helpful via checking in and out we had a few problems throughout the trip and the staff didn t want to help 
 rooms are a little small but this is expected in london 
 room is far from the lift breakfast very crowded
 carpet in the rooms was new nicely finished room and smells very strong 
 there was no coffee tea facility in the room which you can easily find in any other hotel noisy corridors in the morning not only the residents the cleaning staff keep chatting loudly they did great job tidying up though and very quick 
 the business computers did not work making it impossible to get our boarding passes printed this is not acceptable 
 the air con didnt work in our room but they said the only thing they could do was shift us to a different hotel but as we had a second room there for our kids that didnt really work for us no tea or coffee just such a tiny space book a room with two singles like we did for our kids and keep them together to make a king 
 sounds silly but not enough milk and tea facilities in the room after a long journey to london a nice cuppa before unpacking and venturing out again would have been lovely but we felt we had to save the milk for a cup of tea in the morning 
 parking was expensive 
 for the suite the bathroom is a bit too small 
 two rooms booked 6 months in advance were 8 floors apart rooms in need of redecoration looking tired especially the bathroom with fixtures falling off and mold buildup around the tiles rooms basic and small breakfast time on a sunday did not cater for the masses guests having to queue for 10 15 minutes for a hot breakfast this is unacceptable and certainly not worth 17 95 as a consequence of time delays i could not stay for breakfast guests are better off paying less and eating elsewhere for breakfast as there are lots of choices externally to the hotel that provide better value choice and service 
 the hot food in the breakfast bar scrambled eggs lukewarm bacon is very fat and i was wondering if the fruit juices were made from concentrates no yogurt available at breakfast that i could see i m afraid i am not a lover of machines for dispensing coffee hot water etc it s a personal thing 
 the ladies on reception at check in were not friendly they were actually quite rude and certainly not helpful 
 1 when we were there there was construction just next to the room you can hear the noise from the construction and the street 2 one of the rooms i book is just on the ground floor seems there is a wrong design on the bath room there is no difference on the level of the shower nor the barrier so the water flood the whole bath room funnily they provided the broom to sweep the water from the floor
 bathroom were not so clean when we arrive and staff couldn t make to change our room so we had to stay in our initial ones pool is really small and the sun as per the sea ate totally shaded by a big telefonica tower close to this hotel 
 wifi was a bit slow and not consistent 
 room small carpet stained furniture tatty
 it was a bit noisy due to the nightclub in the basement of the hotel which we were unaware of prior to arrival 
 one lift for the entire hotel takes ages to go anywhere staff does not read notes and requirements when booking made one guy not exactly intelligent dealing with the reception long line no water in rooms 
 a bit mean with tea coffee milk in room 
 better value for money 
 the bath in the ensuite had been fixed near the plug and was sharp there was black mould near the shower which could have been cleaned up better some of the reception staff were not very helpful at check out the food in the clayton crowne bar was expensive and we were a little disappointed with quality of the meals as they were not worth the money the restaurants nearby were much better the breakfast had a good selection but on the first day the cooked breakfast was a little overdone and cold but the second morning was much better i think for what we paid per night it was a little too expensive have stayed in london before in much better value for money hotels 
 nothing
 access to food after hours vending machine would go a long way for people who didn t pay the deposit on arrival 
 upgraded to executive room but room was small and tight for 2 persons asked for a river view and got an inward looking room with views of other inward looking rooms bathroom and room lighting fancy but not that practical expensive bar twice the price of the pub less than 100m away 
 had to wait to be seated a while no cups cutlery on table think this is because it is just very busy
 only one lift available and always busy no bar between hours
 had to wait 30 mins plus for breakfast to be replenished not offered tea or toast
 there was insufficient hanging space for clothes there could have been larger cups for tea and coffee making facilities or even a teapot the room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for a couple exploring london 
 more towels
 wrong wifi in the hall 
 the garage parking is a little bit expensive 17 eur day but in comparison to other garages nearby the price is reasonable 
 seriously nothing significant to complain about it s a super hotel we ve added it to our repeat list 
 requested double room but refered to bed thought we were getting 2 single beds with bath 
 the air conditioning was a bit outdated the remote was barely functioning the room could use some renovation 
 stayed as a couple had 2 single beds awaiting us on arrival 2nd night they were just shoved together under 1 sheet after we complained also requested to stay a third night and we were informed the price would triple for that night
 grubby carpets workmen and rubbish men going up and down outside our window the bath drain was partially blocked and the noise from next doors shower was very loud 
 even at the coolest setting the room was too hot at night this was not during a spell of hot weather which in any case does not bother me the breakfast room was also too warm in places near the aircon outflows although the staff could not have been more helpful in trying to move me to a cooler part of the area 
 nothing
 no dental or saving kit in toilet waters were not available in room and delivered only after request next morning house keeping response was slow asked to change sparking water with still one but was not delivered at all 
 wi if wasn t great 
 decor is a little dates and it is a little tired looking 
 horrible breakfast david the receptionist was very rude and my first experience with him when i did the check in wasn t nice at all the hotel was far from the main tourist sites and the gay scene i have been in axel hotel in berlin and it was much better after this experience i promised to myself that i will never come back to this chain of hotels 
 when i booked i was informed i d be given priority early check in and priority late check out i didn t need the late check out but wanted an early check in when i called the hotel directly to organise this they were very unhelpful and unwilling to give me early check in i even got staff at booking com to call them directly and even then they were unable to help with this request which was very disappointing and started my experience with mondrian negatively 
 the hotel wanted to charge 16 for breakfast which was eye watering so we went elsewhere for breakfast 
 there is no fair system of obtaining service at the bar when it is busy the bar staff look at whoever is in front of them rather than asking who is next i would really prefer to stand in a queue and wait my turn in a fair way its unfortunate that the public display their ignorance and continue to selfishly push in needless to say i left and spent my money in another establishment 
 glass door of the bathroom 
 rooms food service everything is just terrible i wanted to cancel from the first instance i checked in but the booking com did not help nor the property management
 room was small 402 
 hotel was near rome metro station but rome metro station is far from tourist spot must have transfer the metro line and takes 20 minutes by metro 
 uncomfortable foam pillows pretty ordinary breakfast bad coffee no extra little comforts in the room not even a branded pen and notepad tatty old bathroom when did you last see a plug and chain in a four star hotel the standard of accommodation in this place doesn t even come close to the image it markets once you ve left the downstairs lounge and bar areas i d seriously consider staying somewhere else if you want a nice room for your money 
 wi fi is so slow that i used the 4g network the bathroom is very modern and stylish but with few lamps it is almost impossible to see much of your face in the mirror it s so dark in there the black walls don t help either not recommened for women who need to apply make up 
 u bahn is not close and you are dependent upon strassenbahn or bus 30 plus minute walk to centre 
 i was a bit disappointed to see a lot of dust on the shelf under the sink in the bathroom where they placed towels face towels and dust is big no no as well there was a big seed like the one that nectarine has on the floor in the bathroom corner did ask reception to send a housekeeping however the room was cleaned only next morning and the dust and the seed were still there guess someone needs glasses 
 our only complaint would be the staff in the bistro seemed very disorganized as you would not have the same server so no one seemed to know or ask about your needs we found it very annoying 
 the wifi wasn t the best in the room expect that everything was perfect 
 very small rooms for singles 
 there was a fire alarm in the morning about 6 a m we wake up and go down personnal did not give any information or excuse only they said it was wrong alarm it was bad experience for us 
 no smoking in any of the rooms no terrace or balconies available no ac or fan for ventilation so opened the windows but was too noisy 
 too small unpleaseant reception 
 better lighting in the bedroom
 they charge you for late check out and they took too long to check us in
 husband would have liked to watch sport in bar area 
 nothing 
 this hotel is really tired and in need of refurbishment everywhere you look there are marks on the walls tired carpets and damaged wood work in my single room the heating did not work a small plug in rad was put in to compensate but this was not man enough for a winters night and i had to get extra bedding my room had the following faults curtains hanging off the track did not close window screwed shut and no way to get any fresh air bathroom had stray hairs behind the door and on the bath the underside of the taps has brown scale build up the soap tray was corroded the spy hole in the door was blocked up with loo roll the bath panel was bubbled from water damage the walls had marks and there was no bbc channels only news 24 
 a very noisy hotel noise outside from traffic even though windows are closed aircraft people talking loudly other guests making noise 
 the noises from next doors showers and bathrooms were like a waterfall in the room whenever they were used i was about to ask for a change of room but there was quiet again during the nights 
 rooms with windows looking towards the main street are very noisy
 the hairdryer cord could be a little longer but not really an issue the milk in our room was sour on both days we do like a cup of tea but reception were brilliant and immediately brought us fresh milk from the bar 
 nothing in particular
 nothing 
 the beds the staff in the italian restaurant where really rude and we had hairs in our food the room was freezing and the cleaners kept coming in room when we said not too 
 the walls were too thin so i could hear the people in the room next door the housekeeping staff were noisy at night and there was a lot of doors banging the deluxe room only had a hand held shower the mattress was not super comfortable but passable the hot water was temperamental quite cold early in the morning 
 nothing 
 check in and check out took longer than necessary at 11 45 am with latest check out at 12 00 there was only one person working the reception the bed in our room was a bit springy otherwise very happy with this hotel 
 bathroom very small only one hand towel per room double occupancy 
 nothing loved it all 
 the infrastructure was poor the room quality and cleanliness was bad not satisfied with the experience will not recommend to anyone 
 the shower was difficult to use
 the staff were very miserable and the bar wasn t manned 
 noises at night due due proximity of night club across the street if your room is in the front 
 hard to find a negative but here goes good quality bedlinen but sheet bit small so didn t stay tucked that s all 
 food was luke warm
 nothing a swimming pool would have been nice the restaurant was a little pricey 
 it was a little out of the way from the ramblas main centre but there is different transport to get there so it wasn t to bad 
 it was a bit pricy
 one of the lifts was out of order and didn t get repaired for the 2 days we stayed there
 room service was not available and they even hung up the phone twice then third time said we ate too busy phone back in an hour if room service is open then they shold cater fully for it the time i was trying to order was not an unreasonable time in no other hotel have i ever had such an issue 
 no coffee tea making facilities in the room and no safety deposit box
 quite far from las ramblas but frequent bus service from outside the door
 breakfast service was poor and food average also ran out quickly
 in the bathroom the washbasin had lots of deep cracks that were dirty so it was not even cleaned properly the washbasin should be replaced i also found a dried up piece of pepperoni on the floor in a corner of the room so clearly the room was not being cleaned well 
 there were renovations to the downstairs lobby so a bit of a trek to get to rooms 
 tiny bathroom everything was a bit bangy open the bathroom door bang close the wardrobe bang a few strategically placed bungs would improve it greatly also whilst the evening restaurant menu was very well priced the breakfast not taken was 22 95 a little overpriced when you re 10 mins from the leidseplein 
 only disadvantage i had was the disruption of the wireless connection between smart phone and tv there was a technical fault accross the hotel which disabled the use of connecting our phones to the tv during our stay 
 no slippers and tooth not and sanitary nits
 very very noisy double glassing windows would fix the issues 
 getting the rooms ready earlier since most are coming in after a long overnight flight
 very narrow king bad 1 1 m width and some times cleaner don t wash glasses for tee and coffe in the evening during half an hour nobody including receptionist could t find concierge
 the room are not clear bathroom same 
 not enough coffee water in room
 the room was small which is the norm for london but not well laid out we had to open the suitcase in front of the door as there was nowhere else the bed was rather small as well the staff were nice but i found the check in rather chaotic for a 4 star hotel i would expect this to be more streamlined 
 wifi was a bit slow but that is not the end of the world 
 nothing to dislike
 it was what i expected from a holiday inn corporate style and slightly expensive for what it is 
 limited choice in restaurant d cor and furniture was a bit canteen
 no kettle and tea coffee in the room restaurant and bar were so expensive we didn t eat or drink there 
 pillows the pillows in the room could have been a higher quality
 the breakfast room was a little on the small side 
 size of the room to little for the size of the bed
 the single room was very small the window was opaque and almost no light or sun the room was next to some room service storage and was noisy there was a noisy door elevator stairs that every time made that noise was like a baby was crying 
 the only bad thing was tobacco smell in the room 
 based on facilities you get pricing should be cheaper bathroom shower although it has a nice old style its not very practical room could benefit of more light no complimentary water
 the cooked breakfast took an age to arrive was fair rather than excellent 
 bit shabby but okay for a base 
 twin beds pushed together rather than double as requested poor bedding facilities like iron and board were available but only on request and often unavailable as on loan late check in time 3pm room was poorly lit 
 ask for quiet room and was put on ground floor backing onto people houses loud noice on nights no sleep 
 the white room lacks warmth in design it s beautiful just too white 
 nothing
 nothing
 the room was a little on the bijoux side 
 there was a lack of communication between reception staff and maintenance men fixing a plumbing problem front desk weren t aware they shouldn t have been checking people into certain rooms 
 there was no bar and restaurant was never open in the evenings would have been nice to have somewhere to sit and relax in the evenings 
 nothing 
 ask for a double bed but got 2 singles beds pushed together no hot drinks facility tea coffee in room listed english channels on tv but only got world news no bar situated in hotel building works started at 7 00am 10 foot in front of hotel room 
 why take 30 from my card when i checked in and processed the payment still waiting for a refund apparently they take the money in case of damages never had this before
 i thought it had a spa 
 wish there was tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms 
 the bar was shut when i got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a saturday night in a city like amsterdam 
 food varieties
 only a couple of minor things could have done with mugs rather than small cups my partner showered before bed and drips continued for quite a while keeping us awake 
 put the price down to 70euros which is the true value of the bed and breakfast experience i am an ex hotelier having worked in 4 5 star hotels for many years
 this hotel did not cancel my card payment what was made on the booking com despite of full cash payment after
 there are no bad points to mention 
 nothing
 nothing 
 the room was without a refrigerator
 the main elevator was under repairs so it was either the stairs or the service elevator on the plus side we did get a free beer at the bar for our pains 
 nothing that we can think of all was perfect
 location of room glass doors of bathroom 
 overpriced and didn t consider it to be good value for money expected a better standard of service 
 eggs were really runny bacon soaking in grease sausages average could be so much better with a bit of attention to details and thought put into how the food is prepared the area for serving is too small the cheese selection is very poor considering this is france 
 over expensive for what you got rooms are the biggest sat right next to the buffet bar for breakfast which was not worth 21 guests banging into your chair and walking between the tables asked 3x for a pot of tea 
 breakfast was very poor
 the room was far too small for a double bed i had to climb down to get out or climb over my husband and we had no where to put our clothes no chest or shelves in a tiny wardrobe with few hangers we had to live out of the suitcase was a bit odd not having a shower curtain so water splashes all over floor 
 it looks congest sometimes because a lot of guests 
 we ordered food form the bar and when it arrived it was cold 
 bathroom was extremely small and the walls very thin 
 the bed was uncomfortable there was a problem with the ac the room was very cold
 far away from champs elys es too expensive compare to its amenity bad room service
 paying for car park 
 some confusion about the booking i have been billed twice have received emails about a no show which did not happen and i was charged one day extra currently lodged a complaint and hope it gets sorted out soon and amount reversed 
 expensive
 the location while close to the center is still quite far away from the main attractions rooms are nice but common spaces have a very dark and boring design 
 a little expensive 
 nothing major but extra fee on changing the bed type
 the pillows 
 reception staff very good but some restaurant staff not too good inefficient and poor knowledge of the english language we have stayed many times in the main building but were put in one of the new rooms this time and we asked to move because it had one very small window and was dark and claustrophobic 
 the duvet could have been bigger a shaving mirror in the bathroom would be a benefit
 nothing much it was great 
 not a thing 
 the aircondition was leaking and thereby dripping on the spotligt below which was rusty there is an increased possibility of ignition and fire with such an failure whichwe told them they did react profesional and said they would check it imidiately but it should not be noticed randomly by two fire safety engineering phd students they shoud have noticed it themself the beds were hopeless and the room was furnished as it in the 90 s
 small room
 wifi at rooms with charges wifi is necessity these days shouldn t be offered at rooms for gbp 9 per night 
 i have booked 2 rooms and asked for a double bed but they haven t secured that during check in we were given two rooms in different floors both were king bed and one of the rooms had another guests in them we were outraged of the situation went in to the staff and they have apologized and upgraded one of our rooms to a suite for the rest of our stay however this was an unpleasant experience to have 
 the location there wasn t many eating places
 the pool was dirty and small
 it took us over 20 min to check in not including queuing the beds and sheets were not very comfortable 
 the hotel sauna was very small swewmming pool tiny too fitness there was only one runing machine the amount money i paid it was far too much for there service
 staff is not really nice but other then that is pretty good 
 floor was really dusty key card stopped working twice because they were close to our phones so i think we should have been told on arrival that they would do that room service was quite expensive and limited wi fi signal was bad in our room the milk provided was powdered so couldn t have a nice cuppa on a night 
 night service 
 food and drink in the bars was extremely expensive
 not didn t like but the breakfast while it was very good and a great selection was a little pricey 
 heating was broken in the room and was very cold despite calling twice it was not fixed and then i just gave up 
 shower drain should be looked at when you shower the water could fill up the space you need to be strategic when you shower 
 the restaurant is very average for their prices 
 check in 
 would have preferred tea and coffee making facilities and an iron although the hotel does laundry at a cost my partner would have preferred a bigger gym but these are all personal
 everything does not fit to a 4 star rating 
 staff generally miserable they couldn t serve any cocktails as they do not have a bar tender when questioned the bar staff were fairly rude and dismissive told us that this is how it is rather then expected be polite and humble 
 no complaints 
 cold room no extra blankets no bathrobes all a bit mean for 189
 nothing
 bedding left white specs all over our clothes bathroom was really small 
 the location is a bit far from city
 size of the bedroom far too small

 small room 1 5 drawers certainly plan to live out of the suitcase and almost no closet 
 bit noisy 
 tv had hardly any channels blood on a pillow as well staff were all friendly 
 a bit far
 in the evening prior to my departure i have asked the front desk to settle my account since i was checking out in the middle of the night i was told by the reception staff including the shift leader it could not be done when i checked out in the middle of the night the clerk could not issue the invoice as he was in the middle of the night process it is either they are using a very old software program or they could not do a very basic thing wich is done in any hotel 
 excluding breakfast no kettle of coffee machine worst mattress
 nothing
 far from the center more then 30 minutes by bus after midnight need taxi to come back 12 the buildings in the area are not directly on the beach 200meter
 expensive
 some bar staff rather unhelpful and air con didn t work
 this is the first time of my checkin experience that doesn t require ids if this happens to every customer and every checkin procedure i would be concerned about the security of this hotel 
 how the check in restricts guests
 the breakfast room was a little on the small side and rather crowded
 nothing
 rooms have bedbugs got bitten by them few times please see pic attached also internet kept disconnecting
 in this level should be there s complementary and breakfast included
 the shower was a joke we are not big people by any stretch of the imagination but you could hardly bend down to wash your feet there were no drawers to put socks etc in and the bedside table was 9 inch square
 there were only two lifts working through out our stay very long waits which was really annoying 
 the air conditioning unit was outside our room the noise was unbearable and the room was very hot and the windows don t open i think the lady who booked us in knew about the noise i did mention in the morning and was told that it is sometimes very loud 
 bed cover was stained
 i loved everything will definitely stay there again 
 smoke detector alarm in 7 30 in the morning
 nothing
 location of room
 having to pay for wifi gym spa and the room being so small for the money

 the room very poor the shower never worked
 room was size of closet street noise was all night 
 very high cost probably because of milano expo
 wifi is 7 per device per day 150 for a week for my three devices i e roughly the cost of another hotel room this is crazy for a hotel that caters to businesspeople i met many others like myself working in the lobby till 2 am as a result decor is quite odd indeed at times unsettling in house restaurant poor in quality and service 
 nothing
 no phone reception in room
 the lift was small and takes a long time to arrive but at the same time happy we had one 
 none
 the price for the breakfast is a bit too high

 nicolette lobby needs redo looks cheap compared to rest of art deco building
 i stayed at this hotel 4 times over the last 4 years this last few weeks being the fourth time i kept going back because of its location this last stay was in august 2016 all the others were feb march april and i saw a major major difference in staff friendliness room readiness and service my stay in august was horrible to say the least we moved our rooms 3 times in the first day and a half because the ac didn t work the taps didn t work there was no hot water and mainly because i had requested 2 connected rooms and upon arrival there were non available so we had to wait for a room to free up and even when we settled in a room we had to replace the blow dryers because they were not working and the kettles twice because they leaked the people who cleaned the room and the porters who carried the bags were very friendly the reception staff was not friendly neither were some of the concierge staff they didn t want to make much effort to help with requests i left knowing i would never return to this hotel again they blamed booking com for issues related to payment at checkout and for connected room request i would not advise anyone to go in the summer months 
 steam room wasn t open 
 parking is expensive unless you can score one on the street 
 nil
 couldn t fault hotel
 absolutely nothing 
 cleaning was very poor found underwear underneath the chair 
 fire alarm went off twice 
 the only thing i didn t like was being woken up by a cleaner knocking g on our room door twice on the morning of departure and it was early and you had u til 12 to depart i didn t think that was very good we were out by 11 30 anyway 
 when i booked this hotel i paid 175 but this week i check the price again i want to go for the second time the price have increased to 300 same room feel sad 
 breakfast is a disappointment with fake eggs and plastic cups 
 the staff tried to charge me for my daughter notwithstanding the fact that i had put all her details on the booking form and had been given a price based on her details the electicity in our room broke during the night and it took almost half an hour in darkness for anyone to come the breakfast was not good and the staff in the restaurant were inept and unfriendly 
 too expensive it is not a four stars room very standard othing exceptional access to terrasse too complex food quite basic it is not a bad hotel but price should be definitely below 100e and access by car is too difficult i do not recommend

 separate blankets
 nothing 
 one of the staff was a little challenging could have just been having a bad day though 
 when it comes to the shuttle not that it runs every 15 20mins but do not that if you ask hotel to call for it they will not help and just tell you to wait it s best to just wait and eventually it will come breakfast is nothing to write home about it is a simple buffet has a few options but that s about it 
 one small elevator for entire building
 hotel food while cheap by local standards was a very limited menu del dia 
 small room limited floor space
 it was very hot in the room air condition was making noise all night but not cooling the rooms it is used to cool just the hotel area outside the rooms 
 was in room 263 on night of august 27 28 problem 1 massive dinner party with very loud music in great western room directly below me unable to sleep until music stopped at midnight asked to speak to duty manager but he was too busy checking people in to see me problem 2 consistent cigarette smoke smell investigated and determined it was possibly due to smoke coming in the room windows from some area between the hotel and paddington station 
 inside it s a maze there was a lift but we had to reach our room by stairs afterwards with a heavy suitcase
 the restaurant frankies charged my master card extra optional service charge 12 without informing me i discovered when signing the receipt this is cheap unprofessional attitude that i did not like

 i have no complaints
 cleanliness personell availability queue at check in really not diverse breakfast no minibar products even though the hotel blocked money on my credit card 
 i thought spa would be a bath with some jacuzzi ideally and a sauna steam room however there were no bath and only a sauna steam and some beauty treatments 
 cost of laundry services prohibitive 
 the views from our room we were facing the back and not the main road 
 we went to a lot of trouble to find out whether this hotel restaurant was open over the christmas period they did not respond to our emails but responded immediately when bookings com contacted them they sent sample menus and confirmed that the restaurant was open throughout it was closed on our 1st night and we were directed to their sister hotel several miles away we had no option as most restaurants are closed on christmas eve the meal was expensive and medioca we tried our hotel restaurant again on christmas day but it was shut so we had to find somewhere else to eat 
 no beakers for teeth rinsing
 very cold at night
 expensive breakfast
 the double room was very small also very little storage space for clothes

 wi fi didn t work for several days the walls of the rooms are too thin you can hear everything your neighbor is doing the smell of cigarrettes perfum and other bathroom odors sometimes came from the air conditioning and the temperature regulator was not working 
 restaurant waiter took them while to come
 not clean not kind
 no iron in room broken elevator

 our room was small 
 some furniture pieces
 room bit on small side
 the pool looked bigger from photos and opening times could be later for lounge and top floor facailities 
 hotel info on accessing vienna centre

 rooms outdated narrow stairs
 breakfast was cold and not much choice
 the breakfast is expensive
 limited on site parking
 service lacking for a 5 star hotel for example we had to ask 4 times for an ice bucket to be delivered before it arrived requested a double room but given a twin asked maid to come back in an hour to clean room and did not reappear also no courtesy room or place to shower once you check out was disappointing as had a late flight 
 it was incredibly noisy the room was next to an open kitchen on one side and breakfast room on the other from 6 45am it was impossible to sleep and it smelt of cooking smells 
 breakfast option too expensive
 to one read one thing on line but when you arrive it s not the same
 no parking or at least they need to provide a valet parking service the internet was very very slow if you could catch the signal 
 probably the worst pillows we have ever encountered in any hotel upmarket or budget

 lack of understanding at breakfast earl grey is not english tea for breakfast breakfast floor was full of crumbs i was in a twin room the towels were folded and put away but i did not know which was mine noisy condensors outside the window
 i did not have any dislikes 
 poor food selection in bar and was of poor quality
 cleanliness very poor dusty dusty dusty rest of soap rest of food hairs on bed 
 nthing
 breakfast just a little bit more choice 
 reception always long queues and when dealing with yourself found answered phone and put you on hold to deal with phone query worst was hearing overbooked so cancelled booking com people s bookings seems treated like 3rd class people never anyone on concierge kept disappearing to back office 
 extremely small room
 the breakfast menu was very insufficient for people eating vegetarian food in spite of not eating breakfast as there was hardly any food for us we were charges 5 euro person day one of the standard rooms out of the two were extremely small the other one was decent 
 there were not enough staff working in the dining room during breakfast the tables were messy there was a shortage of glasses plates etc and some of the cooked food was cold as it had been there a while 
 we had requested a high floor room with ocean view but on arrival the hotel was near capacity and whilst we were offered an upgrade on 3rd floor we declined as was a smoking room the only room in our category left was on the 2nd floor which was close to a conference room being used in the day and we could slightly hear music drifting up from the bar so not exactly ideal service at times a little slow in the bar 
 there is no iron or board in the room but if you ask they will bring one it is a little way out of the centre 15 mins on tram although the tram stops nearly outside and is only e3 so not a big issue 
 nothing
 nothing i can think of 
 room was very small
 paid 30 for upgraded room complete waste of money 
 the refrigerator wasnt clean
 our first room was disturbed by a terrible noise from the elevator our second room had absolutely stunning views 
 we were given different rooms from what we booked we complained and were given acceptable alternatives it wasted our time though pool water feels like glacial melt
 no fridge in the room
 expensive poor breakfast and no tea coffee facilities in room
 staff at check in counter are rather busy so might not have much time to answer your queries 
 no real lounge area to chill 
 nothing really 
 breakfast was average to good but for 140 i would have expected an excellent breakfast 
 stayed for 5 nights breakfast time became very busy most mornings during our stay the staff were normally very helpful and kept restocking the food there was just one morning when things did not go so well guests were waiting around for food drink 
 cramped room
 everything was perfect
 wifi was bad rooms quite smal but still expensive 
 room was a bit small
 mattress was a bit too firm and the pillows weren t particularly good at providing neck support the shower cubicle looked slightly grubby and i detected a smell from the drain 
 nothing
 nothing
 service at breakfast was dreadful waitresses seemed trained to not look up didn t fulfil requests unless asked three times no manager in sight after a really pleasant night it was very disappointing and we were not the only ones to be complaining 
 this hotel is only suitable for gay men we arrived late to find there are pictures of mostly naked men all around the hotel and the online description is purposely misleading adverts for massages all around the hotel felt very seedy checked out immediately the next day 
 lack of help from staff complaint made and never heard anything back two lifts were out of service making waiting for one take about 15 minutes 
 a bit dirty in my room
 poor service worst i have had stayed for long weekend got stung with high parking charges
 little noisy could hear it when my neighbour had his shower at 6 in the morning low water pressure in shower somewhat small bread selection at breakfast 
 location service in restaurant charge for luggage i stayed in ibis in centre night before as was visiting for a conference through work left my luggage all day for no charge even though i had checked out 
 can not think of anything
 the internet connection was poor and as that is of vital importance on a business trip i will not choose this hotel again 
 service in jamie oliver s restaurant for breakfast was poor no wifi in the room unless you signed up for hilton rewards 
 there was only italian tv channels would of been nice to get an english speaking cnn for news of the world
 the most small uncomfortable bed we have ever experienced for a double room along with the small room and a bathroom that was that small my head hit the ceiling in the showers and you had to climb down the side of the toilet to close the bathroom door to get to the sink and have privacy 
 the room was hot and the ac wasn t working but on the website it states ac for your comfort also what wifi the website states free wifi and the wifi didn t work at all when i notified the staff they informed us that there was nothing that they could do due to the hotel being at max capacity causing the wifi not to work i will never stay here again 
 no breakfast included for a 200 per night room is a bit of a disappointment 
 nothing
 the club lounge we got lots of chips and cheap no taste wine i felt like i am in a children party except for the wine of course previous time i was here the club lounge was much better and that was why i booked it this time too but got very disappointed 
 n a
 some wall paper comming off the bed room wall
 i dont think i could fault anything
 spa was closed garage was under construction wifi didn t work well 
 nothing 
 although dinner was included in meal drinks were charged
 i wish our double room wasn t so dark as it is not possible to have a window to the street but the ambience of the room still made it worth it if you can afford it get a suite there is more light next time we will be back here 
 my husband and i both opted for a kensington club sandwich in the bar area which was disappointing as we were not given an option as to what bread we wanted and there was no egg mayonnaise and there was traces of egg shell also the toast was burnt when i tried to explain to the waitress she didn t understand what i was trying to say 
 almost perfect hotel but i probably wouldn t book again because they didn t serve alcohol in the restaurant or bar if you re staying for leisure it s quite far from the city centre 
 it is very noisy which you expect but the rooms at the front of the hotel are difficult to sleep in there was shouting at partying outside until 6am on saturday the gym is extremely small the general pool and spa day is great however don t go here if you re a gym bunny the worst part of the trip was the unhelpful front desk staff i asked to check out at 12 30 but was told this wasn t possible we asked them to bring our bags down and keep them at reception but they didn t bother 
 could not open the curtains
 issues with wifi 
 public wifi is really bad
 door to bathroom wouldn t close lock lamp was broken tv was broken towel rail was hanging off the wall in the bathroom kept being woken up due to strange noise coming from lift air con wasn t sure 
 nothing
 the rooms were very warm 
 there was a guy at concierge who charged me 120 euros for one way city trip while the taxi charge was 15 euros i complained about it and the charge was decreased to 60 euros the same charge for airport transfer that was only thing which annoyed me during the stay 
 it was cold in the room especially in the bathroom and the aircon did not help had some problems with electricity but hotel staff helped quickly 
 tv not working
 junior suite was not really a suite at all just a decent sized room bathroom with no doors and shower in full view of the bed not really convenient very poor room dining options strong smell of paint in various areas of the hotel during our stay overall a decent hotel but not a 5 star experience 
 the rooms didn t have coffee in there was no option to have a cooked english breakfast and no coffee offered at breakfast 
 long wait for room at check in checked in at 2 room wasn t available until nearly 3 30 long wait for drinks at the bar 
 
 bar prices
 our request for rooms with bathtubs were never considered though i can understand the hotel was full during our stay hot food at the buffet being way too salty 
 maid didn t clean cups or replenish tea bags sugar etc advertised with a bar but bar never open 
 all was fine
 slightly cold design scheme
 the mattress was too firm for my liking for a 4 hotel i think they could provide better tea and coffee facilities in the room four little containers of milk for a couple is barely adequate and don t say i can always ring for more i really shouldn t need to 
 better mattress and better wifi
 bed could have been softer and room was small
 price
 the temperature control in the bedroom but it wasn t a problem really i m just trying to think of something when actually everything was great 
 the shower in the first room we stayed in had no water pressure and you couldn t set it to a proper temperature in this way you could only choose to shower ice cold or boiling hot after telling the receptionist we were told that maintenance will take care of it while we were out sightseeing after returning the shower problem still hadn t been fixed and we were moved to another room which had a new shower but was located next to the noisy elevator oh well if it wasn t for the price we payed for this hotel definitely too much for what you get i would say it was all acceptable 
 breakfast was more than adequate but a few more pastries and a better selection of citrus fruits and hot food would have made it perfect the food that was available was plentiful and coffee was continually topped up by very attentive staff 
 a little out if the way and facilities were more like a uk 3 star hotel
 mini bar was used first night but items never replaced check out lady was unfriendly when i told her my bill not left under my door no sign of i am sorry or any such sentiment rude
 quite expensive not including breakfast 
 wasent advise of deposit that had to be left untill u booked out
 the rooms are small they don t have a gym onsite you have to go to holmes place 10 min walking 
 4 rooms booked were horrendous
 nothing
 it took quite a long time to get me checked in 20 30 min and before entering the hotel the front door was locked in the morning some of the personnel entered my room without my permission i don t even know what the purpose was of the entering they also did not have a hair dryer and there we re some stains in the wall and on the chair probably because of intensive use not fresh stains at midnight they didn t have all the foods that were mentioned in the roomservice folder 
 very rude
 having to leave 
 it said on the welcome pack that mains adapters were available but when we asked they didn t seem to be able to help and just handed us a box with a couple of unsuitable adapters 
 i could not work out how to use the shower i was in a hurry and did not have time to work it out the bath was too high for someone with arthritic knees 
 maybe a better view there were building works outside our room
 in the breakfast time i know they are busy but a little bit disappointed the table was not ready and somebody split the coffee on the chair but i had to sit there because they were too busy 
 pillows not the best 
 slow checkin
 in dire need of renovation calling a room deluxe cannot hide the dark truth 
 nothing at all 
 rien
 bar prices too high 
 no
 i was disappointed in the room it was exceptionally basic i d almost go as far as saying the only thing that differentiated it from a premier inn was a different colour scheme we didn t receive fresh cookies on arrival the bar seemed excessively pricey the reason we asked for omelette was the bacon slices were congealed and sealed together whilst the scrambled egg was inedible there was a blood smear on the curtain next to the desk all in all i think hilton have missed the mark with this particular hotel i wouldbt stay here again sorry
 i cannot say something negative all was ok
 bed brocken toilet it smells internet is ridiculous
 cheaper breakfast silly price 
 room was too small
 room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room 
 first of all the breakfast is very poor we arrived and they told us that they upgraded our suit the room was scary and old fashioned we asked to change the suit they offered an upgrade on 20 night and said it s a competitive price looks like their system didn t accept that and charged us on 30 per night not a big deal on the 10 but that what happened this hotel is over expensive 
 london prices 
 the lift was very cosy but enjoyed using the stairs 
 service is not that good had to take my two bagges down as no one is around to help me 
 bed not so comfy noisy even with window closed on 6th floor air conditioning made me cough very dated bathroom 
 i could not wait to leave depressing bedroom old broken stained and tatty walls fixtures fittings and bedroom furniture noisy fan in room could not switch it off springs coming through the mattress pillows were old flat and extremely thin less than one inch in thickness 
 bed in centre of room rather than against the wall on one side 
 the heating was broken they didn t tell me until i asked them how to get it to work very dismissive apparently they don t guarantee heating very odd breakfast was average i ve stayed in a similar location paid half the price had a bigger room nicer decor heating and a better breakfast disappointing 
 bathroom towels a bit rough 
 room service was not worth the money we ordered a pizza and got 4 rectangular slices that was the only downside about the hotel everything was amazing 
 breakfast could be better
 rooms dark due to windows to internal court yards 
 reception desk staff was a little indiscrete re monies in front of my guest when i was checking in 
 room was super small it was at the front of the building and was so noisy difficult to sleep bring earplugs it s so very overpriced but this is kensington and i felt safe clean and warm staying there as a solo traveller so that makes up for it
 nothing 
 i ve no complaints
 if you want to be in amsterdam then the location is less convenient you get a great comfort room not so big but you need to travel a bit
 restaurant with it s services
 the rooms are some badly soundproofed
 the rooms are really small i was a solo traveller in a double room but even for one person it was tiny the staff at check in was short to say the least the hotel is ok nothing more definitely not 4 star 
 the room was absolutely tiny never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 euro is awful first night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger
 rooms are small
 my partner was not on the booking and was made to pay the full amount upon check in which meant that i didn t have the opportunity to use the gift card i had had 
 breakfast was too expensive 17 50 pp a night so we did our own thing 
 the room was really too small for two persons 
 the apartments building is in the back and is not even connected to the main hotel building which makes it a bit dangerous especially at night the hotel tried to make the checkout at 10 am although the booking is till two hours after that 
 room dark blinds broken room very small dirty concrete wall outside of the window on ground floor expensive for what we got would not return
 bed length
 check in was busy and impersonal but efficient 
 everything
 nothing 
 i would have preferred the tv to be in the bedroom part of the room 
 no bitter real ale only bottled largers then a service charge for serving them at the bar breakfast was disappointing for the price
 restaurant was expensive small portion size both myself and husband were hungry after meal would not go again 
 nothing
 in fact everything is ok i have nothing to complain
 the pool is very cold and also the jacuzzi is not divided from the big pool therefore the water from the pool and jacuzzi has the same temperature additionally the area for children is also using the same water of the big pool so if something contaminates the water from the kids area this will affect all the place in addition the hotel is very far from the underground and the entrance is not well located 
 nothing
 everything nothing i disliked
 room pillows very uncomfortable 
 room service do not respond to calls in late hours baggage handling is slow
 couldn t fault a thing 
 didn t sleep at all because of the ferraris and other cars revving up their engines most of the night and early hours of the morning terrible although the room would have been lovely apart from that complained to staff and they said that they have informed the police to help with this situation 
 the a c does not work properly sometimes it s cold other times it s hot they don t clean the rooms the cleaner comes every other day and tidy the bed only no vacuum cleaning or changing the bed sheets nor cleaning the toilet 
 tower bridge is not a very interesting area in evening but tube is easy and handy
 nothing 
 nothing
 reception staff could concentrate more on being friendly and less on trying to sell an overpriced breakfast 
 the water pressure from the tap in the bathroom it trickles but everything else is simply perfect 
 nothing i can think of 
 the twin beds were right next to each other like a double bed and this was a club room 
 nothing
 value for money
 one girl named veladimir on the reception is ignorant and attitude with guest is not acceptable instead of guiding guest she tries to show norms and tries to undermine guest require hospitality course rest all staff was very good and friendly 
 nothing
 how small the room was 
 food in the resteraunt was ok but not up to the standards of the hotel breakfast was brilliant though 
 nothing i was very happy
 bed was much too high for a disabled visitor
 thought service a bit disorganised in the restaurant even though restaurant not even half full all of the time 
 finding the room signage is poor
 bed uncomfortable wifi poor
 far from the city centre
 there was no kettle for making tea or boiling water this is a very basic necessity in any hotel whatsoever everytime i had to go down to the bar to fetch some hot water which was inconvenient and also risky to carry boiling water in lift and then take it to room for making tea the hotel provides a 24 7 bar and expects us to purchase something as basic as tea for 5 pounds not done 
 should have booked some more nights
 there is no aircon in the room
 some of the girls on reception were unhelpful and at times downright rude
 all was good 
 location was not ideal for us
 the chair in the room was broken and the shower was not right we upgraded to a bigger room 
 staff were not very friendly bed looked old pricey and patchy wifi
 our room had no working air conditioning you could tell as soon as you walked in the room after telling the bellhop and 2 subsequent calls to the front desk the manager trolls up an hour later with a portable air conditioner and apologises that the hotel is full and this the best they can do his attempted humour stating you re lucky it wasn t last week with the hotter weather let s just say that went down a treat buddy the so called portable air conditioning unit stood nearly 2 metres high and a metre wide i asked where does the hot air get expelled he said that it s all contained in the unit upon further inspection it s a dehumidifier that you have to pour water into the unit blew out old cigarette smells and as far as the decibel volume wow i was then offered another excuse that the whole 4th floor was out liar seems the air conditioning was working perfectly in the hallway now i know things go wrong and apologies aside they offered us nothing in compensation for the problem no room discount no drink no food no zip we even requested a later checkout and had to wait until morning for it to be approved another problem to watch out for is the toilet in the bathroom it s raised on a step that juts out further than the toilet seat edge nearly broke my toe early in the morning as far as the location of the hotel take it or leave it didn t float our boat mind you the 2 negronis we got in the alley down the road cost us 60aud one drink was enough 
 waiter girl at terrace stressed 
 nothing to report
 kept getting kicked off of wifi so had to continually put in room and password 
 the bathroom was a mess the pillows were bad the bed was tough like a brick my access card demagnetized 3 times in 2 days the elevators were overpopulated and the stairs are alarmed only to be used in case of fire 
 breakfast was disappointing had to queue for a table waiting approximately ten minutes and food was lukewarm we expected waiter service with a choice of hot breakfast menu but it was all self service 
 the patio area is lovely but they have two rooms on level with the patio so you feel you have to talk in hush tones or not at all 
 the staff specially the concierge were not so friendly unlike other hotels which are less than hilton this hotel did not over free bottle of water long queue for check in and check out
 breakfasts were too busy and often we arrived and certain options were not available anymore the same rate is paid so the same variety should be available at all times 
 not much i did have issues with the wifi not sure why it took very long to download emails 
 small
 the facilitie the staff atitude
 the suite we had was very tired looking not all the bulbs worked repairs were required and some had not been finished very well 
 room had no direct sunlight
 check n counters 
 the basin overflow was full of bacterial growth and the shower cubicle was similarly unclean these problems are only visible when cleaning teeth or having a shower the shower tiling was also showing signs of coming away directly below the shower taps i would suggest you review your monitoring methodology and instigate a periodic deep clean i wonder if you will actually act on this information 
 sadly hotel is losing its edge especially for 4 stars this is my 4th visit as it is near my office but 4 events needed dealing with a within about 30 minutes of checking in to my room a member of staff just came in using their pass card without knocking luckily no real issue and they apologized but it happened b no hot water on the first morning and no shower water at all so a wash and shave in cold water no time to fix as i needed to go to work but i reported it to the front desk c i was in 615 a corner room near the staff access door this door clunks annoyingly every time it opens and closes along with seemingly easy sound transmission of staff conversations on weekday mornings probably not noticeable as i was going to work but not acceptable at 6 30am on a saturday d whilst fetching my eggs and sausages at breakfast my coffee and apple juice were cleaned up despite leaving my key on my table if one of these had happened on its own i would not have said much but taken as a whole this makes me reluctant to rebook next time writing this before i check out so let s see what the desk staff say 
 a bit pricey 
 old structure needing serious refurbishment 
 room could do with decorating and bringing up to date staff in the bar were not friendly and got the drinks order wrong twice when checking out we were told we didn t owe anything even though we said we did to then have money taken out of the bank a week later but not receive any notification or receipt 
 breakfast too expensive as always in most 5 hotels but no problem plenty small caf s nearby for a small petit dejeuner 
 corridors needed a hoover the restaurant was very expensive 
 felt more utensils in the kitchenette would have been useful eg tea towel tumblers and wine glasses
 mould in the windowsill in the bathroom rather small room 
 this may be personal to me but i found the lighting in the room headache inducing the rooms have a sickly orange light which can t be switched off as it is integrated with the rest of the room lights i had to request maintenance to remove the light fitting i also found the mattress too soft otherwise the location and staff were good 
 some of the other geusts
 room was noisy due to service shaft
 rooms very small not much light inside
 overpriced low quality breakfast not particularly efficient staff 
 big queue at check in this is not acceptable ugly view from room 
 nothing
 they don t have slippers 
 the bathroom i didn t so much mind its smallness since i was travelling alone but what i resented was the fact that as soon as you ran water for a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool 
 our suite was 2 stories and the circular stairs were narrow a little challenging to navigate but we managed it was truly a wonderful hotel 
 very noisy room not soundproof and next to lift lift made a noise going up and down and heard people talk all evening bathroom rediculous small you need to bend under the basin to sit under toilet if i was overweight i would not be able to use it
 room was smaller than expected we were told we had an upgrade however the room was small and we were suppose to have a room with a bath originally but there was no bath in said upgrade
 nothing really everything was perfect
 my room is near the street and the soundproof doesn t work very well 
 a bit dated keys needed to be updated on a regular basis 
 we left a charger at the bathroom i have ringed the hotel twice they said they will get back to me however they didn t also i have to pay for the water in the room it s normally have 2 bottle of free water in hotel room it s never happens in 5 stars hotel as my experience i also paid extra 2 bottle of the still water even you never opened them not able to be refund 
 it s small and really just a place to sleep their sister hotel is probably better for many for the facilities which i m told are shared it s just a couple of hundred meters away 
 getting into rooms corridor it s not lively
 forced to have another room as i have kids genral policy for the hotel as mentioned in booking all children below12 are welcomed so i stayed in one room and my family in the other room 
 the bath wasn t in perfect status 
 no wifi stan including manager was rude whe n i rang them four times to try to fix it 
 the rooms and some facilities are worn down and for the price its not worth it compeard to other hotels in the area 
 the room was a little bit small and the stairs are steep 
 faultless
 some staff were unhelpful at times especially giving directions
 the cleanliness of our room was very poor if you wanted 2star then i guess that would have been fine 
 nothing 
 very clean nice staff except for some delay when we asked for blankets when we arrived everything was great thanks
 in related to cleanliness our glass did not get cleaned or replaced with the new one and eventough the hotel nearby to station there isn t anything else to see in walking distance because the location far from any sightseeing 
 room needed refreshing slightly out of the way
 twin beds pushed together although comfortable when asked for a double room 
 not clean
 nothing 
 the room was a bit too small for my liking i felt as if the bath shower room was bigger than the room 
 n a
 the location of the hotel is not close to the metro station you have to walk for 20 minutes and is far from the center is good if you want to be in a quiet place but not a good idea if you are going for tourism when we arrived the sink was broken and the bath got flooded as soon as we opened it the good think is that they fixed it in few minutes 
 what is there not to like everything was perfect 
 had requested twin beds which turned out to be two mattresses with one duvet and linen for the double in effect it was a double bed not twin beds 
 the bed was uncomfortable not a real queen bed but two adjacent beds 
 i booked a queen size bed through booking com just to find out that its two single beds when i arrived at the hotel
 the massive bicycle jams and discourteous riders you take your life in your hands just crossing the street from the bikers not from any cars 
 housekeeping was done late in the evening breakfast was exactly the same everyday 
 cost
 our room and bathroom needed an update 
 poor breakfast as we had a 3 starts hotel location we had 2 rooms but no one had a stunning view lighting not shining restaurant absence
 nothing to complain about
 pool is tiny was photographed from a very flattering angle 
 room was very hot overnight air con unit wouldn t allow temp change only fan off low high 
 the price central london prices are quite high 
 noise from lift in the bedroom
 the room was smelly when we first checked in the ac was not working properly so at night i was sweating we turned the temperature to strongest fan and lowest temperature but still not much cool air it was a beating the distance to the tube stations were not that close but we discovered a bus number 63 that would shuttle us from king s cross to the hotel so we just budgeted extra 15 minutes to our trips to account for bus travel time 
 front of house staff poor very rough round edges building work going on
 air conditioning didn t blow cold room was dusty
 just the pillows were too big would ve liked them to be a bit flatter 
 the room had not been cleaned very well and the food items in the mini bar had not been checked and were open and scattered everywhere the general cleanliness of the room could easily have been better
 very dark corridors a design feature and a rather dilapidated restaurant with a poor breakfast also the screen over the bath was nowhere near the shower so water went all over the bathroom when i took a shower 
 the queues to get in the breakfast room were large once in there we had to queue again for hot food by the time we had waited for toast and eggs the rest of the food was cold more kitchen staff needed
 no gym
 we were offered a discount on the breakfast at the hotel better to have breakfast included in price 
 as above we did not get the room we paid for one tiny double when we paid for two separate beds due to bad back and restless sleep very dissatisfied
 no drinking water in the room
 one of the nights we were there was a saturday night and there was a lot of noise from the street people yelling out and cars honking until about 4am the other night was very quiet though 
 free wifi
 small room and bed
 room lighting could be brighter
 room was too small for that money breakfast was really exspensive 
 there could have been a proper reception desk not just a couple of small stands the first impression at the entrance did not correspond to expectations and the street in front of the entrance was covered with litter perhaps because of strong wind 
 beds were too soft breakfast rather disappointing for the price
 because we stayed 2 nights would of liked a top up on tea and coffee facilites but not a major issue as plenty of cafes bars close to the complex
 room too small and bed too small
 loud air con
 breakfast could be better bacon and scrambled eggs undercooked both days 
 room very tired bathroom needs updating
 there was nothing to complain about 
 same breakfast every morning there could have been changed in variety especially when you are staying longer time you would appreciate to have variation on the buffet 
 we had to leave early 7 00 a m on sunday which was within the checkout times although we had told the staff we wouldn t want the full breakfast we had ask for coffee and toast none were available the cleaning staff was in but that was all no one was available to check us out and when someone did call they told us it was all taken care of upon checking my credit card i found that the charges had been made as agreed upon but they had been processed 48 hours before our anticipated check in our booking agreement stated we had until 24 hours before to cancel without a charge and we would not be charged until we reached our accommodate in this case it wasn t an issue but not very good business 
 nothing
 nothing 
 staff service and facility
 the shower wasn t very hot and the windows didn t open at all which for one night was manageable but for a longer stay would have been a problem as we like fresh air 
 ac unit was broken instead of fixing it their first solution was to open the windows we were later moved to a new room
 dated rooms small and very tired the bed was so uncomfortable it ruined our weekend 
 bit more room but given the brilliant location i was happy to swap size for place after all size is nt everything o 
 pillows please change the pillows my second time in the hotel and pillows are the same uncomfortable 
 18 50 for breakfast wasn t aware of having to give 150euros for security deposit on check in
 nothing to dislike
 miss leading saying 2 bedroom apartment when one of the rooms is a single
 no safe in the room 
 view from room really disappointing considering we had paid for a more expensive wonderful room view of harbour sea obscured by the building and was not great possibly unfortunate as i am sure other rooms offered better views pools also very small for the size of the hotel 
 bath room was so tiny and very old furniture and broken furniture you have to walk almost one mile from reception to your room 
 ac in room did not work and made the room smell of curry needed to sleep with the window open which made it noisy a kettle for tea would have been nice shower was terrible not much water coming through although the pressure for the bath water was fine my freinds were upgraded to a superior room and had a mouse in it they also had slippers bathrobes and a kettle room much too expensive taxi could not find the place 
 the location meant either a 10 minute walk to tube or bus which proved more irregular than advertised
 far away from the center you need to take a bus 20 minutes to reach city center room was not thoroughly cleaned 
 nothing i like everything just little far from knightsbridge and harrods and really i strongly recommend this hotel
 there was heavy drilling when we arrived we had to move to another room following a long journey to get to the hotel the bed was very hard we only found the pillow option leaflet the day of our departure the shower tray did not contain the water flooded the entire bathroom the fridge space for guests was far too small we had to keep moving the minibar items out the carpet was filthy although we were told the room was not generally offered to guests we had to wait past the 2 pm arrival time for our room to be ready building works next door meant noise and goings on all day a reduction in tariff would have been welcome as we were not told of this prior to our arrival and paid a supplement for a river view room 
 not an ideal location would liked to have a kettle and an iron in the room as well
 the service at the coffe shop and restaurant and the cleaniness of the hotel and room
 slippery sheets knees keep sliding when making love
 when i arrived at 1130pm i was told i had been booked into their sister hotel and when i complained they then gave me a room in the hotel but someone had been smoking in it so i had no choice but to complain i was the told they would order me a taxi to the sister hotel so i waited for five minutes but then i was offered a room just off the lobby which was fine although noisy because of its proximity to the lobby 
 i am currently sitting in my room at this supposed 4 star hotel after managing to scrap together a measly 3 hour sleep my husband and i treated ourselves to a one night getaway as we were attending his works party nearby and the reviews of the hilton looked perfect they couldn t have been more wrong there is nothing about this place to suggest a 4 star rooms are small the shower is average and worst of all i may as well have had the whole hotel to stay in my bed the amount of noise that one could hear i specifically requested a quiet room and yet they placed us on the ground floor opposite a busy road i was woken by deliveries rattling towards the hotel rubbish deliveries beeping outrageously as my morning alarm and the people upstairs crashing their thunderous feet every 5 seconds no soundproofing whatsoever i have paid 150 pounds for my worst one night sleep in a hotel i have ever had should have booked a travelodge 
 no sound proofing in rooms bring ear plugs to check in and out there s a massive queue at breakfast you re asked if you d like a tea or coffee then you ask for a cappuccino and they tell you you ll be charged the room was cold and there s no mini bar overall i would avoid this hotel 
 nowhere it was mentioned that the elevator did not go up to all the floors and the room i chose and having to use the stairs was not in my plans as a recently operated person also the food was not the best on room service ventilation system in the bathroom was very loud and impossible to have a relaxing bath smell on the floors was a bit stuffy not nice 
 in the bathroom you could not swing a cat the shower was very poor and the room only had one comfortable chair for a five star hotel i expected more from 
 na
 no complaints everything very good
 location a bit away from cafes and historic areas needed to use taxi or metro 
 for a room of this price and calibre one would expect the safe to work there to be a mini bar the heated towel rail to be hot bit below par really 
 breakfast staff in restaurant during the breakfast price of usage of garage noise from the street
 no isolation between rooms you can hear your neighbors activities 
 the hotel is located a bit far away from the center we took the train from liverpool st though the walk to the station is exhausted 
 maybe having a socket near the bed will be great because guest can plug in their phone for charging before they go to bed 
 bed could have been a bit comfier mattress was very hard that is just personal preference though wouldn t stop me from staying here again 
 construction going on next room waking me up too early in the morning the ventilation machine outside the window also made a loud hum even though the room was advertised as sound insulated 
 nothing 
 member of staff opened the door to our room whilst we were sleeping and disturbed us during the morning
 we stayed there twice over a 5 day period the first room was not great we had no view and looked out over air conditioning ventilation ducts the air conditioning was poor room very warm however as we wee only staying overnight we weren t in room long enough for it to be a massive issue the suite upgrade was much appreciated and made the last night of our holiday a very pleasurable and memorable one 
 the room was really small should be highlithed better in the photos the rooms appear bigger also the building was really small 
 the cleanningness the quality of bread etc
 bed smelled like rotten flesh
 for a supposed 5 star hotel the rooms are pokey and small i upgraded to a deluxe room which was only marginally larger than the tiny regular room no tea making facilities in room having a pantry on each floor is not convenient if you want a morning tea in bed no cupboards for clothes just an open hanger no desk in room hardly room to even walk around the bed for a hotel of this price it s exceptionally bad value for money i would not recommend and am highly unlikely to return 
 the breakfast buffet room was a little small and at times became congested with guests 
 the hotel needs modenising some fixtures going rusty carpets in the hall old and a little bare i have stayed many times in the hotel but it really needs some work
 some rooms had only 3 tv channels available during the works aiming at updating the entertainment system
 we thought drinks were expensive
 receptionist
 had to queue for the lift once 
 room very small
 not enough towels and toiletries left for three people in triple room had to request for more
 no bath in rooms
 bed was a bit small
 bed and bathroom
 i wish the bed was a little more comfortable and the shower had better water pressure 
 rooms needed a little more lighting
 hotel had lost our room reservation even though i had a confirmed booking made approx 12weeks prior to arrival selection of toiletries in bathroom was very poor soap shampoo gadget in shower almost impossible to operate lift was not working no explation given and did not look like it would be functioning any time soon 
 nothing there was nothing to find fault with 
 nothing
 bathroom not separated with a door from the room not so usual 
 no view from room
 can t think of anything
 parking facilities require agility of spiderman to get in only for very experienced drivers with small cars one way driveway catering for both up and down traffic with no visibility and twisting round a corner waiting to see what insurance company says about the accident we had due to oncoming car forcing us into a wall then refusing to apologise and driving off specifically requested twin room in comments as booking com showed available but booking processed as a double my friend and i were initially told this was not possible to complete as housekeeping staff had gone home upon further pleading they changed our room so why the initial fuss 
 queuing for a table at breakfast 
 poor english with most of the staff really hard pillows and dubious stains on bathroom walls room 209 
 there were several noisy events in the hotel which were very clearly heard in 1st floor rooms and 2 nights out of 5 disturbed sleep we did get a rebate for the disturbance but i don t expect that when paying so much particularly poor exchange rate and am unlikely to return
 getting space in the elevator weekday mornings when business clients typically check out took 3 or 4 tries not a big deal 
 rooms are very un comfortable and basic we re missing
 toilet was running continously the sliding glass door to the bathroom was off the rails the glass door to the toilet was hanging crooked and was jamming the glass door to the balcony did not work properly it was hard to open and close because the mechanism was loose 
 bathroom is extremely small men who are a little bigger than the average size will have problems getting in to and out of the shower stall the room is very small staff is friendly but their knowledge on how to use the metro tube restaurants attractions etc is pretty limited the breakfast is okay you can probably do better eating at nearby cafes 
 very small room very small place for breakfast there is actually no restaurant just a lounge space next to check in 
 restaurant staff are a bit lazy
 everything was perfect
 n a
 didnt like our view it was not what we had asked for our bathroom was very small and our shower tray and doors were filthy 
 nothing
 nothing to cause annoyance the accommodation was fine 
 felt the room was small drinks in the hotel were very pricey
 i couldn t sleep because it s too noisy 
 the people at reception were very unfriendly
 gym and swimming pool closed soon 8 or 9 pm walls were that thin which you could hear others talking in your room 
 much too expensive for what it was the bed was pretty solid and the duvet was so thin we were cold all night the room was much smaller than expected considering how much we paid and we could hear everything other guests were doing including brushing their teeth the breakfast was very average and no one seemed to be paying attention when we tried to get coffee 
 during this one night stay couldn t say there was anything i didn t like 
 air conditioning was not working
 staff on reception a bit snappy with me not fun
 breakfast was a bit disorganised and the prices at the bar were outrageous 
 price of room for size
 car park charge 20 on clear on your site
 bath shower was not good 
 very poor reception area there were no instructions in the room how to work the phone and or tv 
 nothing
 kept losing wifi connection
 lighten the atmosphere which is a bit on the dark side more light and plants would enhance the place slow elevators breakfast could be better 
 standard of customers as well as staff are not up to 4 stars 
 too high price for few amenities of old style lift almost zero hidden rooms as if under besiege
 nothing you cannot improve on excellence 
 nothing as such 
 55 daily parking 25 daily pet fee staff a bit disorganized but likely due to renovation
 awful would not recommend 
 just found the cooked breakfast wasnt very hot and had to move tables half way through our breakfast as someone wanted the table we were sat at 
 nothing 
 super slow check in room not ready by 2pm as promised room downgrade major rework during stay super average restaurant
 we booked a twin room and if i had any complaints i would say it was a bit on the small size but as we were only able to stay for one night it was adequate 
 no room safe
 the room was terrible an underground room in the basement with a cold draught half a window overlooking rubbish and trash i increased temperature and it didn t work had to walk to reception to ask for help as phone was not working and nobody turned up to help with heating or phone there was hardly wifi and reception and i had to stand up aginst the window for signals i couldn t speak to colleagues to find out where they were it wasn t a good experience i asked for a refund and was told to speak to booking com i left 3hours later to a neighbouring hotel 
 the window looked on to a wall the staff were sarcastic
 they have some parking but they reserve it for thier managers not what they told me after i drove for two hours becuase they said it would be ok to get parked the recommended the ncp down the road in farringdon do not use it it is like a scene from a horror film and i doubt your car would be there in the morning 
 breakfast is expensive room a bit expensive also
 shower could have been better had to hold the shower head in my hand but othwise good 
 there were no available parking places at the hotel and we had to park in another parking much more expensive the two tvs do not work simultaneously the furniture would require refreshing 
 the hotel charged the stay before we arrived that was not the deal booking com is clear that it will only charged at front desk at arrival 
 i don t mind that this is an older place it was clean and comfortable there were a few minor fixes however loose handles etc that should be taken care of 
 the room was tiny barely enough space to walk even and the bed was super uncomfortable with the mattress being lumpy and hot there was no air circulation in the room 
 the only little niggle was one of the bar staff in the bar downstairs wasn t very attentive and he looked pretty miserable when you asked him for something everyone else was lovely 
 extremely amateuristic bar service and very poor breakfast no fresh juices etc etc no international tv 
 we booked with an offer via booking at a very low price so the first accommodation we have been given was not a room but just a bed in a cellar it was at level 1 no chance to get there by lift but just moving in the background of the hotel till the kitchen of the restaurant we asked immediately to change the room and we received a good one at first floor 
 was very expensive for what it was 
 its not a 4 stars hotel except the lication abd the stuff the hotel is very basic
 better location
 there was no price list for the mini bar that i could then at checkout charged 5 euros for a coke 5 euros for a sneakers 
 there wasn t anything we didn t like
 difficulty parking 
 i had two rooms and there was ac problem with one of them and they didn t fix it 
 staff at check in unfriendly and not apologetic when our room wasn t ready well passed check in time ricardo at the bar was never there we had to get reception to find him when we wanted more drinks when he did come slowly back he was very unfriendly 
 cold bad service extra charges staff were not negotiating properly
 all was good
 all good thank you
 location was far from any restaurants taxi ride or metro into centre to get food problem was in house restaurant served poor overpriced food approx 20 euros for a plain tomato pasta in a bowl 
 breakfast very expensive
 see through shower glass no privacy when showering or going to the loo 
 hala invoice fatura e posta ile yollanmadi ok k t they have not yet sent me the email invoice just too bad
 no free water in the room breakfst in the executive lounge good be better
 lack of meals 
 the food at the in house restaurant room service was horrible gordan ramsay should pay them a visit
 booked a double and a twin room each cost 120 very disappointed with the double room room and bathroom were about half the size of the twin room if the double room is normally smaller then it should be cheaper 
 not one complaint or suggestion for improvements 
 rooms are tired and need to be updated and sound proofed
 having stayed here multiple times i was a little bit disappointed with the breakfast both mornings the breakfast was cold 
 not that the hotel could help it but the neighborhood is sketchy 
 hotel is going through a major refund but is definately looking tired
 check out process very slow namely in invoices issuing 
 nothing
 room need to be well cleaned smell of the room was very very bad that lead us to change the room floar 
 n a
 disappointed the pictures of hotel miss leading
 we didn t actually book this hotel but were transferred here and still unsure of the reason why as we were never told 
 the room was small the size of the bed was totally not comfortable to two adults 
 limited restaurant facilities only a very basic menu no vending machines for cold drinks etc 
 nothing
 room was a little dated and not very big but it was clean and more than adequate for our needs 
 nothing 
 the smell of the hotel a terrible fragance
 we had the room with a view of the tower we where on the 4th floor and could only see the top 3rd of the tower which was nice but a little underwhelming the toilet was separate to the bathroom and was really really small 
 smalll room
 bar wasn t 24 hour 
 mattress was probably the most uncomfortable thing i ve ever slept on ac for the room was uncontrollable very hot room even with the windows open on the top floor was fixed within 24 hours 
 decoration old and shabby carpets in walkway should be changed to more modern look to brighten up elevator should be redone looks more like a service lift window is too small and it makes the room feel tight despite decent room size 
 massage disappointing asked for therapeutic massage got very soft massage 
 far too hot in the room could not open window as on street level so we were so hot all night and didn t sleep well you need to ask for a higher room 
 showers in room difficult for work friends 
 very small room 
 the room too small the bath no clean
 the staff recommended for the restaurant is perfect
 car park was nearby and very expensive 39 50 euro day but i suppose there is nothing you can do 
 there was only 2 coffee sachets and nothing for the coffee machine which is expected but as we couldn t take the coffee home we didn t bother to buy any the booking said the room had city views but ours was facing an office building on the other side of the building from the river and city 
 little bit tired decor rooms not completely soundproofed
 staff so bad no any respect to customers 
 beds were so hard that we couldn t sleep well at all we have travelled quite lot but never have slept so bad in hotel as now i can t understand why you don t have possibility to use extra mattress 
 the very poor quality of the breakfasts especially the croissants when chez paul bakery is right around the corner 
 the desk staff service
 opening times of pool
 nothing
 no aircon at all in the whole of the hotel due to building works on 4th 5th and 6th floors and it was 36 degrees not informed of this at time of booking or would not have stayed there room was ovenlike but given a fan dubious stains on walls lampshades and bathroom walls if windows were open it was super noisy the french like their horns even at 3 in the morning no tea and coffee making facilities breakfast was very expensive 20 each every morning did not partake we ate out each day and it didn t cost 40 for brekkie 
 the noise of traffic in 329
 the city view 
 the hotel is looking a little tired the air conditioning was not up to the temperatures that we had in july the breakfast service and food is functional and feels rushed and institutional 
 there was no air conditioning in the room and it was very hot being summer so it was difficult to sleep
 internet acess
 executive room without club option is extremly small 
 the hot items on the breakfast could be included in the price for the sake of an extra 5 per guest
 wifi
 when i arrived there were twin beds in my room i called reception and within 10 minutes two lovely ladies had converted them into a very comfortable double with crisp white cotton sheets super 
 breakfast was too expensive 
 expensiv parking 25 euro day no decaff cofee in the morning at brakefast 
 the air condition did not seem to work properly the room was always too hot as compared to the hallway where ac was working nicely we also had some troubles with internet from the beginning 
 music played late at night as we were sleeping and the base came right through the room very poor nights sleep would not stay there again 
 absence of kindness
 2 single beds joined together to make a double bed it did not feel like a double bed and is not acceptable for a couple 
 the wetroom
 room small bed was very small double towels were damp when we went to use them but were soon given fresh ones air con although great caused condensation to drip onto floor 
 view from room just a brick wall
 can t think of anything 
 access to hotel road closures during our stay
 nil
 too tiny room to accommodate 2 adults plus a baby 
 it was really noisy as it s located opposite side of pub
 i have never stayed in a nosier hotel room in over 20 years it would probably have been quieter if i had slept on the roof 
 was walked as overbooked 
 nothing 
 no regrets 
 the price of hotel with no food included expensive
 the hotel could do better with the smoking area outside as it was littered and it s at the front entrance and the dustbin at the main entrance could be larger as it was overflowing at times and cleaned periodically especially when they have large number of tours coming in 
 underground public parking was 27 50 a night which we thought excessive although we were in the middle of barcelona had trouble leaving parking even after paying the bill as hotel had not validated ticket and took us 30 mins 
 really basic accommodation
 room size atrocious
 we had to wait to check in the room wasn t ready even tough it was 15 o clock already then it took a long time to check in as all of our passports had to be photocopied the receptionists were so ineffective 
 instructions for using lifts could be bolder
 the area around the hotel was a little gloomy 
 cancelling access to the room before checking out time
 small bathroom
 nice bedroom but dirty carpet 
 nothing except the construction going on the street just near the hotel and noise bothered us every morning except the weekend 
 pillows not soft enough plug to washbasin in bathroom was tricky 
 unuseble wifi connection old room equipement
 tiny uncomfortable room and this was the large room version just like a cupboard
 spa staff were very rude when told by reception we could use the spa for a shower on the day we left when we went to the spa the ladies working were very dismissive and arrogant pool always too crowded not enough places to sit
 two separate twin mattresses even placed next to each other rarely work well for a couple
 rooms too small elevator small and crowded 
 the staff who were there were very good but they definitely could have done with more staff serving at the bar bar food in evenings but that said the hotel was very busy because of the sail amsterdam festival and perhaps they weren t anticipating it would be quite as busy 
 unconfortable sofa
 room service messed up my order but not too bad paying 5 00 room service was a bit harsh when they messed up the drinks but i paid it anyway
 nothing 
 nothing
 but in some standard rooms the bathrooms ar really small and not very comfortable and you should know that on weekends you must select a room in the right wing of the hotel as there is a dance club next to the hotel on the left side with incredibly loud music until early morning you won t be able to sleep 
 don t take restaurant advice from staff one of the nearby restaurants they recommended was abysmal the gym does not open till 8 maybe 9 am apparently the gym equipment made a lot of noise which would disturb those sleeping and so i couldn t use it needed to leave early my wife who used the gym said it was very basic and poorly equipped the reason why we stayed here was proximity to the conference centre while that s true next time i ll stay in the city centre and take the train to the conference centre train stops right outside the conference centre 
 room was quite inaccessible in adjacent wing up stairs across bridge down 2 flights of stairs 
 not much
 breakfast was rather tired over cooked nasty fried eggs poor quality bacon and bread etc 
 the rooms were smaller than i m used to but i believe that is standard in london 
 the mattress is too soft 
 horribly dated room very uncomfortable bed and pillows no shower gel just bars of soap 
 everything was very good keep up the good standards
 bad service by check in durty old room non renovated bathrooms bad breakfast
 noisy bar over road
 coffee machine was in an strange place and couldn t fill it or switch it on
 cold and no heating controls very expensive really a rip off especially 12 for small breakfast 
 parking is expensive
 having to sleep in a room with no air con and the only option to compensate this was an air cooler and a fan that was like trying to sleep in a box room with a jet engine impossible to relax watch tv get ready in fact overall enjoy or short stay in london absolute disgrace that this room was sold to us as the hotel was going under a renovation feel conned by both hilton and booking com even more so now that the manager offered us a free up grade on our next visit refused as this was just simply not good enough 
 there was refurb going at the time which meant there was a constant drilling close to the room
 the picture for the hotel in the internet is kind of misleading we thought the hotel our room has river view 
 only thing was the room was abit small the staff didn t actually tell us where are rooms was or direct us so had to figure it out ourselves 
 extra charge 50 pounds per night for an extra bed for a 3 year old elevators are really slow at time of check out
 because of the shape of the hotel some parts of the rooms can be slightly compromised in terms of space
 we brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated 
 it s out next to the amsterdam arena so wouldn t suit everyone but was very near where i needed to be the gym is very well equipped by hotel standards although the weight mutli gym is overdue some maintenance 
 our room was quite gloomy 
 now i only stayed ther for one night with that in mind here is my review the spa area was well not a spa the pool was tiny 5 6 meeters long i could be wrong and the hot room as well as the shower in the spa area smelled like mold the only thing i wanted to do after going into this facility for a brief time was to wash up when i talked to the assistant about it he asked me if an other user maybe caused the smell to which i still roll my eyes the next day the pool was not working so i could not check the bathroom at the room had a wet smell to it as well that was fixed the momnet i opened the windows so taking into consideration the age of buildings in paris that was not a big problem when i arrived i got informed that they did not have big towels in my room so i should try to manage when i asked to use one of the bathrobes from the spa the assistant said ok when i arrived i was informed that checkout was at 12 00 and if i was any late i would be charged 50 euro per hour also 100 if i was to smoke even though i stated that i am not a smoker the above i had to sign in an agreement something that i found very unsettling since it would be hard to proove i did not smoke after i left the room and the country i was also informed of the possibility to get a breakfast in the room the assistant felt complied to add that the 13 euro breakfast i payed for the next morning because it is in the room we can not bring everything i informed her i will not use this service overall the breakfast was nice the only thing i found challenging was to find where the plates and cutlery where kept since they were behind a bar and there was no personnel in the room to seek help from 
 the mattress of the bed is too hard pity this is the only negative note really too hard at least for my taste 
 we were given a room facing inside despite paying for executive room with club access
 the wifi signal was problematic and unreliable it was difficult to take calls and receive messages which were required for business purposes 
 the pictures were nothing like the venue in fact i m still looking for the bar 
 the rooms are a bit small and there was no bath just a shower 
 the small room 
 nothing
 pillows too high not enough toiletries 
 location is good because it s close to a tube station and cinema but the views are awful 
 door was a little touchy tried not to wake entire hall
 no bath robe
 could be more affordable
 wi fi ports blocked can t play online games from hotel 
 the staff at the restaurant were very nice but you just hear them talking loud all the time as if they are selling fish at the market also sometimes they didn t bother to clean a pile of plates from a table where people are having their breakfast they preferred to clean a table when a couple left the restaurant first priority always those present just stating this in a good way to improve not to be harsh on the staff i m a supervisor myself so maybe that s why i noticed these things 
 would of been nice to of had a double mattress not two singles with a double sheet couldn t believe i could not get a coffee from the bar in the evening 
 nothing
 i didn t have any negative experiences however the breakfast is rather like being in a 3 star all inclusive in europe the quality of the cooked breakfast for the price paid was disappointing and it was rather smash and grab in there as i think i had breakfast at a busy time the tv idea is awful who wants to sit opposite the sports news not me 
 this is definitely not a 4 star hotel it is the worst hilton i have ever stayed at and i am surprised that the brand has such a hotel the carpets the wall paper and the furniture is just falling apart the reception and restaurant desk personal is not helpful at all consierge personel is however very helpful the shower and the tv are from the last century there is a really bad smell in the hotel for breakfast be prepared to have about 15 persons waiting for a table in front of you 
 nothing
 pictures not pictures not like a reality
 breakfast on one of the mornings was a bit chaotic because it was very busy that particular day
 noisy morning thin walls you could hear your next door room guests sneezing curtains movements etc smoking smell all over hotel in halls and rooms rooms cos we were there with some other friends and their room was same even we had a non smoking room staff could have been more polite even if they hate their job no need to be so grumpy important tip check your bill as you may have some extra things added on probably by mistake at lunch then at dinner again at the ground floor restaurant cannot comment the top floor restaurant it was booked for a party only one thing i know its a smoking one 
 we had a two day booking but needed three days i requested this on day one they told me the third night wouldn t be a problem and they again confirmed this on the second day however when i arrived at reception on the third morning they told me they didn t have a room for me and i had to leave we had made no alternative arrangements and we found ourselves on the street with no where to go in a barcalona which was full to bursting point the hotel staff had no concern and no consideration for our situation when i put it to them that they had twice assured me there would be room they just ignored me we ended up in a hotel 20 miles out of the city this event completely ruined our trip 
 nil
 no complaints 
 window on noisy street no air condition
 absolutely nothing
 rooms service provided
 small room size
 a little noisy in the morning because of garbage collection truck in the street 
 an odd overwhelmingly rich and pungent perfume on entering the hotel foyer that if deliberate is a significant error in taste the lifts are slow and the rooftop bar was a little dull and given the rest of the offerings in the city probably best avoided also being asked to join the membership of the hotel to improve the room wasn t appreciated at the hour of check in after midnight being told that i had a small room and so should become a member to increase the comfort meant i had to challenge this in finding the confirmation of the room booked it was a superior double 
 very small pools 2 for a hotel so big 
 there were no room service at all and also the service in lobby was very poor 
 location s entourage isnt the greatest works in progress and does not match the photos closest metro station is san babila so expect some walking to do or ride the bus some of the staff members are not worth being front desk assistants while others exceeded the expectations and provided great level of services its unfortunate for a 5 stars hotel and would impact the journey of customers having a long stay what i hated the most is blocking my credit card with the full amount of money preauthorization though it was booked as prepayment only pay at thr property directly however on last day after checking out the receptionist stated that the amount needs around 2 weeks to be refunded to my credit card this is very unfortunate specially when i paid the full invoice by cash so the blocked amount should have been immediately like other booking com hotel previously did with me or they should have released faster than that blocking such a huge amount on a customer s credit card for 2 weeks isnt very convenient 
 the breakfast there are no things to eat just a fruit and bred jam ham nutella 
 small thing shower wasn t great if you re fussy about that 
 how hot rooms were and not being able open windows
 nothing
 not organised at breakfast
 very small rooms
 view
 a little more interaction with you on arrival my first visit to paris from australia so was keen to know things they were simply focused on getting me processed rather than suggesting anything this is quite a normal french approach so ask questions room did not have a corkscrew or any cutlery or wine glasses you can get by asking at the desk and be prepared all wine has corks unlike australia remember to book at least 24hours in advance for transport shuttle to the airport difficult and expensive cost 55 euros to get a taxi shuttle was 25 euros and was a good service 
 room view is tilly obstructed by a conservatory
 my stay was too short 
 basics for cooking were not supplied had to buy salt olive oil coffee sugar etc in much larger quantities than we could use in the five days we stayed 
 the property was under construction very loud and dusty breakfast in the unfinished lobby area 
 not clean bedroom having floor not clean
 during the breakfast there is no real service and the variety for breakfast is very very poor people smoking in the breakfast area very near to children it must have been a very beautiful hotel 20 30 years ago 
 spent a minimum of 12 minutes in the elevator every single morning it stops at every single floor even if the elevator is full that was so annoying 
 the room was like the black hole of calcutta no lights in the bathroom one on in the room and that must of been 2watts
 breakfast was not very good 
 n a
 could have done with some extra pillows found the air con a little noisy turned it off and the room was too warm ah well 
 that weekend my partners parents came to visit us in london and annoying got offered a room with a double bed and two single beds together in the same room when we paid for a family room for 4 highly think it wasn t worth the money and was also very embarrassing for our inlaws to be going through a difficult time just to get what we paid for shouldn t be advertising what your not giving so annoying 
 no bad experience
 impossible to locate the hotel when you arrive after dark no air conditioning in the rooms
 nothing to advise 
 nothing
 we arrived at 9am and staff told us we would be priority for check in which started at 3pm and still we had to wait till that time we were no priority at all 
 i got two single beds instead of double staff was ok but not that friendly room was quite small 
 restaurant service and food was terrible and overpriced even for paris would have been handy for them to tell us about the garden we only stumbled upon it on the last night guy at checkout was quite rude to me didn t ask how our stay was no english speaking channels on the tv no iron in rooms room upstairs with communal iron was useless 
 spa could be bigger
 no problems
 size of some rooms is too small we took 2 standard rooms and one of them was much smaller 
 the location
 beds un comfortable pool area not clean
 everything
 people coming to breakfast in pyjamas
 disappointed when we went for breakfast there wasn t much variety on bread and vegetables etc and not as fresh as it should be 
 room was a little on the small side and breakfast was expensive 
 nothing
 small rooms extra charge for pets
 as above
 nothing
 thin walls
 no fault of hotel but nightlife in surrounding area was not great 
 can t think of anything i didn t like oh the shower leaked when you had the pressure on high
 please add some towels and provide a water tank in the gym the structure is a bit oldisih
 the size of the room and the old worn out furniture compared to the price
 the bed was slightly too hard same with the pillows the room was tiny and dusty 
 how the deposit works how there s no complementary breakfasts with the suites and the tvs not working well 
 i didn t like that our room smelled musty i don t think it had been cleaned the view from the room was a very over grown grassy area it wasn t very appealing at all 460 for 2 nights in the hotel was way too much i would not stay here again 
 no hot water very dusty to expensive hotel would bee cheaper
 the desk staff while very nice could have been better informed as there is no concierge 
 nothing
 the small table in the room is very cheap and wobelly there is no 24h room service arrived late and was hoping to have a meal 
 1 no mirror in the room except the bathroom long mirrors were available outside in the hallway 2 balcony is nice as u can see the eiffel tower however no chairs and table provided in the balcony 3 we were charged 60 for early checked in ie 1030am we requested or 1 hour late check out ie 1pm the reception informed that 60 will be charged this is an unusual policy of a 5 star hotel 4 there is nothing romantic sense about the hotel it is more for business trip maybe the decor 5 smelly carpet in the hallway to the room some fresh lilies or air freshener could help removing the stinky smell 6 position of the bed is facing the door to balcony and the sunset is direct to your face when you try to unwind after a day of walking tried pulling the curtain not as easy as we thought 7 the standing lights is not convenient it fell down whenever we try to slide the curtain 
 the staff around the pool and the pool restaurant did nothing to manage some very obnoxious children and teenagers in the pool we literally couldn t even sit in our son chairs and get some sun because these children super so poorly behaved and were splashing water and other guests the staff clearly should ve manage this and did not the pool area is also very short on lounge chairs and there are too many tables for food and beverage that are just not being used this whole experience really makes the pool area of no value 
 no more gym here they should remove the picture from site that s the only disappointment 
 cannot think of anything i did not like
 there was a great deal of renovation though necessary it was on going throughout my stay 
 a minor crib you had to register for the wifi it would have been better if it just worked 
 if you were saying awhile there is little room for storage of your clothes etc this was the only drawback we found 
 didnt like the setting of the room i hated the desk that took almost half the space room food was ok but not like in pictures swimming pool is not heated which was not good for the bad weather when i went in late october
 a bit far out from the main city centre hub however it was very easy to get to via public transport tram and metro stops very close by
 rooms are getting tired lights not all working wiring poor in places poor internet toilet seat cracked little things that add up 
 maybe a better coffee set up in the room even though they offer nice coffee downstairs during breakfast my wife and i still need just one cup of coffee or espresso before leaving the room 
 i ordered a sandwich at the bar and one minute later was served an inedible item a sandwich on stale bread with soggy wilted lettuce and tomato and one thin slice of something the waiter told me it had been pre prepared and was left over from the day before i neither ate nor paid for it 
 nothing
 nothing
 room is very small 
 no windows in bed bathroom
 nothing
 pillows could be firmer 
 can t think of anything i had a problem with
 just one recommendation if you ask the front desk personal to call for a taxi make sure they call a taxi with meter otherwise they will call a company that charges almost twice as much for a ride than regular taxis not nice 
 time of breakfast is too early
 we were in a studio adjacent to the atrium whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise the bedroom is near the door right at the atrium it s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary on the second day when checking out i asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room 702 i believe so they could hear for themselves we got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken with the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out 
 lighting in the bathroom was poor for makeup purposes not near much unless you are there for the arena or the concert venue hard for uber taxi pickups i was charged more than the booking price for the room 
 bathrobe and sleepers were not included
 i had a problem with swipe card for the room i had to contact reception 4 times in my 3 nights booked because the swipe cards weren t working and that was a headache otherwise nothing bad 
 sausages were poor and the orange segments were atrocious 
 wifi is a joke room smelled like chemicals every day after cleaning window was open all day 
 breakfast is partly buffet but there is a poor selection of cereals and it is always better if you can help yourself to fruit we had a problem one day with room cleaning but it was immediately rectified when we told the reception 
 the only thing i would suggest is to make it clear when breakfast starts and ends we were told when we checked in that breakfast went for an hour later on sundays 11 30 however when we showed up at 11 we were told a little sternly that breakfast had already ended and were told to find a table quickly and to leave quickly this was a bit disappointing as it slightly brought the experience down which thus far had been awesome 
 nothing 
 bed was very squeaky and two beds put together is a little uncomfortable for me because i like to sleep in the middle 
 the bell hop are extremely impatient rushing you at the reception the moment they see you with your luggage they are trying to move you not a nice feeling of being herded like cattle did not appreciate it one bit had the same problem with check in and check out 
 n a
 bedroom was a little tired and dated with wallpaper starting to peel from the walls in several areas the club room facilities were pleasantly good and in plentiful supply staff in there were very attentive and polite
 mattress was a bit rubbish so didn t have the best night s sleep parking is also difficult to find when a van is parked across the concealed entrance and 15 night is a touch expensive 
 room very small for what we paid
 road noise hot but it was an exceptionally hot day
 i didt like the drilling at 9 am
 two of the staff did not speak english well and were difficult to understand as such they were not able to help with a simple question 
 would have liked biscuits with the tea and coffee in the room and the room was noisy with a droning noise all the time 
 no hot water in bath room air conditioning so bad receiptionist no cot for baby available
 had to leave after 2 nights 
 five second burst of fire alarm in the middle of the night and only warmish water in the morning
 genuinely finding it difficult to think of anything very minor point no car park but not really an issue in central london 
 although we were staying on the ninth floor the noise from people on the street was sometimes distinguishable 
 everything is so dark the building is black the rooms are small with dark walls and heavy furniture we moved from a room to another double beds both were very small the cupboards were ridiculousuly small for 2 people and we couldn t move around with the luggage internet kept breaking decoration is quite heavy and needs a real revamp too expensive for the quality and comfort that we got 
 room size a little small
 value for money very very expansive breakfast 
 small room sizes there s a weird smell as soon as you enter the lobby price is a bit too much
 the hotel is under renovation so lot of noise during the day you should have mentionned it 
 the prices were high for what was expected for 500 a night we have stayed in a relais etchateaux hotel before and expected a more sophisticated setting in all we enjoyed our stay and appreciated the helpfulness of the staff 
 nothing
 1 hotel equipment 2 room 3 breakfast 4 staff
 booked a queen bed but non available on arrival due to it being nye and the hotel being full so settled for twin beds 
 elevator got stuck once and looked a bit out of shape 
 sick soundproof all the noice in the corridor and nearest rooms is clear the furniture looks more shabby comparing to the pictures and it s quite dark due to the relatively small window no bathrobe in the superior rooms but it s mention in the description rooms are much more simple comparing to the lobby design by tram it s 30 mins to duomo and tram strikes happens taxi costs around 12 15 eur to the center so for me it s not a great location
 nothing really 
 first room was terribly small changed it found dust on phone tv and other items poor isolation on street windows caused cold air stream for one of beds 
 rooms are comfortable but compact
 construction going on around hotel so lots of pedestrian areas blocked off but not hotels fault just annoying 
 every thing was good
 the staff were extremely rude and unprofessional we were accused of smoking in the room when we didn t and charged 200 without our approval and they scammed us into an earlier check in so that we had to pay for an extra day 
 only the door of the bathroom was very hard to push and close it was not close properly the breakfast was only continental only any extra will be charged i would like to have tea and coffee facility making in the room
 the temperature in the room was quite chilly due to the fact that the door window to the street could not be completely locked so it was needed to put the air conditioning to the very high level but still you could feel the low temperature air crawling at the floor level 
 it was excellent nothing to improve 
 the shower is really poor you hardly get any water and bedsheets were just about ok not clean enough
 staff at the reception could have been a bit more welcoming 
 breakfast was a bit chaotic
 the wireless internet is not good at all slow connection one gets bumped off a lot regardless of the system android ios 
 hotel is run down and is in dire need of renovations 
 would be nice if they offered breakfast but at least there are tea coffee facilities in the room and no breakfast is preferable to a bad breakfast 
 nothing
 room was warm and aircon noisy but still a great hotel and will certainly consider next time too 
 view of the room on a train platform lack of privacy purely functional no attention such welcome message free bottle water no gideon bible no pen no paper 
 for the breakfast there have no vegetables only different kinds of bread ham and cheeses 
 choice of pancakes omelette or ready made breakfast sandwich would be fun 
 we had no negative experiences to report 
 very small rooms some with a staircase inside poor breakfast
 room is a little small no place to sit and relax 
 the rooms are tiny and the room wasn t cleaned very well 
 there was nothing about the service or comfort that i could criticise the only thing i would say as a recommendation to the hotel would be to refurbish the outside artwork the lights on the garden wall they are really cool but need to be revived the inside of the hotel is spotlessly clean and in great condition so they are just lacking that last bit of attention to detail by looking after the outside 
 only criticism is we thought the rooms would be bigger but they had everything we needed
 lengthy queue in reception expensive car park
 tv programs didn t work has to be fixed by staff after room cleaning the toilet paper was missing 
 it would have been nice to enjoy a cocktail in the bar lounge area when returning from dinner but it closed at 10pm having said that there are plenty of great bars near by 
 the bathrooms should be renovated
 rooms where slightly small but enough to suit our needs nice and modern
 the view from my room
 nil
 tea and coffee at breakfast not always fesh and hot
 the room was comfortable but in need of a refurb particularly the bathroom which was a little tired and dated the shower was temperamental and difficult to control and one of the sink taps had seen better days there was no hotel guide or room service menu in the room and it was impossible for anyone to tell me where i could get a bottle of water to take up to my room at 6 45am as all the facilities were shut i have stayed here before but was unfortunately a little disappointed by a few minor things this time 
 the fact that they did not refresh towels every at least 2 days 
 the room in the basement is a scam will suggest everybody to avoid this hotel
 no free wifi and room wasn t worth the money paid to say it was a delux room i ve seen better traveloges
 small room
 if we had stayed longer it would have been nice to have a swim or massage but it didn t have that available at this hotel but that s a very minor thing 
 small room tight space had my legs and head hit a couple of times as i get in the room and while taking a shower 
 needs refurbishment
 nothing
 rooms service decorated very badly
 shower pressure was next to none as a lady with long thick hair washing rinsing took a little longer than usual
 was all good 
 all fine 
 rooms are a bit small 
 staff not helpful
 not enough plug sockets in room
 n a
 cold room didn t ready when i arrived more than 3pm poor breakfast with high price
 towels too small and nowhere to hang them very hot in ground floor room and difficult to adjust temperature 
 steep steps to the room but can t be helped
 the location of the hotel is on the hill so it takes you longer to get to the hotel and to the metro
 the hotel was obviously overbooked and we had to eat breakfast in the conference room without windows on saturday
 they didn t mention anything that the parking is not included in the price and when we left they told us about that the girl at the reception realized it was not ok to ask money for that since there was no mentioning about it so they covered for it also we paid the breakfast the day we checked in and every morning we had to wait at the restaurant because they didnt see our reservation 
 room a little small 
 strange very small duvet too small even for one person 
 the receptionists were rude there was no fridge in the room
 nothing
 little bit on the pricey side
 the smell coming from the toilet
 lifts terrible
 would have liked a more varied menu for our evening meal all italian 
 opulent decor not to my taste
 view of building out of window
 no complaints we lived everything 
 n a
 they have charged my card 40 more than the price stated in the page
 nvt
 small lift was out of service when we arrived though back in service shortly after would have been nice to have been offered some assistance to carry cases up 5 flights of stairs 
 the quality of the bed itself was lacking and the bathroom was looking rough around the edges i ve stayed in much nicer rooms for 100 a night 
 can t think of anything we didn t like
 every time i go out i had to ring the bell to get inside the hotel 
 we had people walking on the roof right outside our first floor room in the morning i had asked for no stairs because of mobility problems and was put in a room up 2 half flights 
 unfortunately we visited the hotel during design fiera week and the prize was outrageous the service at the breakfast was un attentive and the breakfast place not very welcoming
 fresh orange juice for breakfast would have been nice in such a good restaurant 
 the size of the room the elevator too slow
 no tea coffee making facilities in the room unbelievable room was very basic only slightly better than a hostel magnolia woodchip walls similar colour duvet no pictures on the walls totally bland chairs in the rooms had seen better days don t know where it got it s 4 from we were close to moving to another hotel 
 noise from the street
 when we got home we discovered that our bank account had debited twice and upon calling the hotel they completely denied this it took a visit to my bank to sort it out
 nothing
 
 room service staff were very bad and slow our light lamp wasn t change for a week and i have spoke to then for more than three times 
 the pool was so small
 the bar prices
 air conditioning was not working in the hottest days of the year poor service part of the staff at breakfast did not speak english and could not help foreigners with even simple requests a general feeling of shabbiness both in the room and in the common areas
 the carpet had nail tacks sticking out so easy to stab your toes when going from bedroom to bathroom was reported to reception but wasn t fixed when we returned to room reported again on checkout so no idea if attended to 
 trouble getting wifi after several calls
 nothing
 the toilet top is brocken need to be changed
 nothing
 sausages and coffee at breakfast were awful room too hot 
 was to top standard broken buttons handles tiles dusty
 all good
 the hotel is within walking distance of the city s landmarks but it was still on the verge of the tourist area so people that are not accustomed to walking better use bikes available at the hotel i wouldn t recommend the top floor it feels a little like servants quarters and i guess it once was 
 set up of the hotel was confusing to find rooms and the bar attached was small so not much seating
 it was great experience but i m disappoint the service in the morning when i checked out i was supposed to check out at 12 and the cleaner knock the doer loudly to reminder us which was oaky but they was continued to bother us another two time before 12 o clock that s was the thing annoying me which i advise you should improve otherwise it was great to stay in the hotel i checked in on 31 and check out 1 june and stayed the room was 219 
 rather slow service at reception bathroom floor rather dusty 
 old bathroom and no shower only a bathtub worn off carpets and furniture questionable and ugly electric wiring behind the desk 
 the service of the staff at check in all though i ve stayed here before with no problems i had issues checking in because i didn t have photo id once someone who knew what they were doing arrived there were no problems it s just a shame all the staff weren t as helpful 
 nothing really 
 we where basically in the basement very small room and which was very worn out and it did feel exactly how i imagined a cell would feel like
 i feel it was all perfect 
 requested a double room got a room with two single beds pushed together to make a double really uncomfortable also noted that there wasn t a single usb port to charge phones etc had to unplug the kettle as there were no available sockets needs a serious upgrade to bring it into the 21st century 
 breakfast wasn t as good as previous stays 
 parking place garage is really narrow do not try to park car unless you have a very small car
 breakfast very expensive
 the air con didn t work that well so we were quite hot all night 
 my room was very small this was really disappointing
 could have a shop on site 
 very small bed rooms bathrooms breakfast with no choices and no professional staff in hotel
 some attention to detail lacking on a couple of aesthetic features such as paint on skirting and bottom of room door having some wood chips 
 some common areas could do with a bit of a facelift the only bad point was that the manager confirmed by email that we would have a taxi reserved for our departure at 7 30am but the desk said there was no reservation they managed to get us one within about 20 minutes but it was a worry because we needed every minute of the three hours we had at cdg airport 
 no plug socket by the bed
 everything was fine
 rooms are tired and need modernising 
 some staff aren t smiley 
 nothing the room was perfect 
 the thermostat in the room did not work and despite my daily request it was never fixed the door did not lock properly and despite my requests the lock was also not fixed room too hot security no lock non existent ng would not return 
 no restaurant no bar no air conditioning no telephone 
 my error in believing my reservation included one more night but the hr handled this with grace despite my embarrassment 
 no hot water in winter small lift just for one person no help for luggage
 nothing
 to much noise in the pipes when the people in the room abowe us were flushing the toilett
 
 room needed a bit of a deep clean a bit of dust in the corners and on the floor also the toilet had a bit of a funny smell 
 the bed was to small the television was on the wrong wall the bath did not fill up as the plug did not go in properly 
 hotel was very hot even though it was november it was mild outside no way to control bedroom temperature very noisy traffic from street below great to have a balcony on floor 6 but too noisy to leave door open and very difficult to sleep no tea and coffee maker in room provided with put me up bed and thin mattress but changed quickly when complained 3 adults booked 
 my key cards had to be reset several times but the staff saw to it that the problem was permanently fixed which was a problem with the mechanism 
 room was a junior suite a bit small
 small breakfast room
 the room was dark the bed was lumpy decor in the room and corridors was in need of refurbishment
 the size of the room difficult to squeeze between the foot of the bed and the wall the noise of doors slamming as fellow guests left their rooms the placement of the glass shelf magnifying mirror and toilet paper holder in the bathroom the designer was surely having a lend having to stand on a chair to access the safe and the inedible and cold bacon and hash browns 
 bar prices to expensive breakfast cold and undercooked had to keep asking staff for things at breakfast which would normally be provided instantly such as cutlery drinks sauce etc no kids channels on tv
 facilities on rooftop patio not open had to get own drink and take it up in lift hotel is missing an opportunity especially at new year time walls very thin could hear people in next room
 aircon didn t work changed room twice no sugar with breakfast toast was soggy and inedible ordered taxi and it was forgotten about and had to be re ordered
 i think that the bed was too soft it should be harder the bottles with shampoo etc could be bigger 
 bedrooms a little too small and basic
 nothing
 one small complaint the scrambled eggs at breakfast were always cold those buffet line heaters never work well after day 2 we had the staff microwave our plates in the kitchen and all was well for us anyway 
 very rude staff not a clue how to book us in big confusion with car parking not even offered breakfast at check in which caused a problem when we walked in to the room on sunday morning staff said you not booked in one good thing the luggage guy very helpful and we got the impression he knew what was going on more than the 6 check in staff all standing behind the desk
 no gym
 breakfast was very poor for what they charge the hotel is about 10 15 minutes walk to the nearest tube not so convenient if you are on the move all time 
 we stayed twice on our first stay our room was very small but very comfortable and the restaurant was closed for a function we were not told of this until asking to book on our second stay we had a fantastic suite which was brilliant 
 ground floor interior should be rebuild as it is terrible the same concerns 7th floor 8th otherwise one treat the hotel as something from 2 stars category i still do not get how has the hotel obtained 4 stars i would give 3 
 the bathroom is a bit compact for the design and scale of the hotel but it s a small gripe in what was otherwise a great stay 
 men s toilets were not in an acceptable state not the fault of staff who responded quickly when informed 
 room was very small
 ambiance of the hotel is very dull 
 would have preferred semi skimmed milk with tea 
 hotel facilities are visibly dated and are in need of remodeling staff seemed to be a bit bored and not as attentive as one would expect although they got the job done breakfast buffet is poor for a 5 hotel in all respects from the variety of choices to the quality of food provided hotel was overpriced based on our experience probably due to high demand of the season christmas nye 
 i slept on a pull out bed and it wasn t changed every day
 the quality of the breakfast could be improved in addition there is not enough room in the breakfast area for all guests i had to wait both days to be seated the room was quite but very dark facing the small courtyard and with the emergeny stairs in front 
 nothing
 shabby bathroom needs a lot of tlc
 breakfast did not look particularly good so chose to eat elsewhere also an additional 12 12 50 if not pre bought on arrival 
 why does room service not check whether the tv remote control still works 
 internet in the room is bad 
 nothing
 the bed was amazing just to sort for somebody with back problems 
 pillows weren t great 
 nothing 
 all perfect
 not enough coffee sugar and milk for 3 people expensive water when other hotels give it free
 the room was so small for 2 people and the bed was not comfortable 
 restaurant limited and limited seating
 the only think that i would have liked would be a bath 
 the room was ridiculously small we couldn t fit our bags in there with us it was a joke i also didn t like that we seemed to become second class citizens when it was discovered that we booked through booking com we were told that was the reason why we were not allowed to partake in breakfast even though i didn t enquire about it because i knew that it wasn t included in this booking it leaves an bad taste
 wireless it was very bad and not enable to connect in the room
 temperature of the water for the douche was very difficult to keep constant
 overall not worth what we paid for
 see other comment
 breakfast range maybe could have been broader but i am really nit picking when i say that cos it was adequate for me and my wife
 there was not a safe in our room our tv didn t work which was only annoying when we wanted to watch the news a couple of times our toilet sometimes didn t flush usually these things would really bother me about the property but the hotel is charming clean and in a good location so i can forgive them 
 main entrance could have been more conveniently located
 though i appreciate this was a single room it did feel a little cramped and dark however i would certainly stay here again 
 staff in restaurant has problems with hearing
 rooms very average powdered scrammble eggs very poor machine coffee poor not what to expect in paris wifi terrible
 the bar staff humphreys bar were not particularly friendly or helpful 
 at fisrt the sofa bed was broken but we get change to another room
 location was not great needed at least 15 minutes walk to go to city center wifi was very troublesome and used to disconnect after sometime air conditioning in the room required fixing twice in five days stay as it was getting warm and stuffy couldn t sleep properly for two nights 
 entrance to room was pretty narrow which included the tea making area no complaints beyond that 
 breakfast ending at 11 00 on a sunday brunch at weekends should be an option
 nothing but toileteries would have been more good i felt it s not upto the mark of premium quality 
 dark colours in the room
 couldn t modify the room temperature even though there was a control plaque on the wall bathroom taps had the tops missing so looked a little dilapidated second breakfast not so good got toast not croissant as ordered and no confitures with it 
 overall we were delighted with the hotel and don t have any negative comments only thing i would point out is that the pool is small just in case you have aspirations of swimming lengths every day didn t bother me at all as what do you expect for a rooftop pool but i d guesstimate that it s maybe only 5x5m didn t eat in the hotel at all so cannot comment on quality of catering nor did we have time for the spa 
 there is nowhere to park near 
 nothing
 drinks were very expensive 
 elevator has some problems 
 car park could use clearer signage
 nothing i could really fault
 everything was slow i understand is a very busy season but is a big hotel so everyone should be ready for times like this i called the restaurant and couldn t get through for 20 mins 
 there is no ac and rooms are too hot in september to provide fans only its big terrace would be perfect in winter but not in summer
 rooms were a little too hot at night time but netherless lively with i nice touches
 its possible to hear noisy neighbors through adjoining door always seem to get view of garage at the back am i jinxed
 the mattress on my bed far too soft for me
 no communication between hotel and the booking com non of our requests were taken into account and eventhough we booked a room for 2 adults and one child we were provided with room with only one bed reception staff was highly unprofessional all trainees who provided us at first a matreess to put on the floor for our 8 year old daughter when we finally got to a proper reception staff who was very professional we finally got the room we were supposed to get however this has spoiled our experience completely parking is outrageously expensive 36 eur day 
 nothing
 nothing
 the hotel is really small but still cosy no elevator room is really small but if you travelling without kids its fine 
 everything else
 room sevrice is soo bad it takes 30 min to bring a bottel of water and they charge 5 for any request they have to add more reciptionest
 the tv was very slow
 the worst stay ever every thing we need they charge us and plus while check out no staff to help imagine we took the bags to the loppy need to work out on their behavior and staff
 not being able to park my vehicle due to the staff filling the car park with unpaying guest s being woken up at 10 30 please and then again at 1 15 an to move my vehicle avoid at all costs 
 decor in room a little worn paper peeling above one of the windows below the pelmet lampshade had a watermark on it and door did not lock properly from the inside
 the bathroom was missing bathrobe and slippers minor point but the ms was expecting it 
 the walk way from the hotel to the o2 wasn t open the o2 still doing work there side we feel we should have been informed about this before we arrived had to walk round to get to the main entrance now this isn t far but if i didn t take some sensible shoes and coat it was very cold this could have been a problem
 no bad experience but breakfast pricing was a bit highif i chose not to pay up front for all days
 only stayed for one night
 housekeeping staff were quite lax no towels no replacement sugars that sort of thing they were also very noisy in the corridor in the morning 
 i was not been informed prior to the visit that there were road work before the hotel
 the room decor was extremely tired the carpet had bleach all over it the bed was too soft
 nothing we didn t like
 nothing good really in the hotel plenty of good breakfast places around the area smelly room noicy hotel got their stars probably 20 years ago when they did the last renovation i wouldn t book it again 
 the rooms are outdated with old furniture and bathroom 
 bed is a little short 
 room tiny slow room service
 quite old style hotel
 nothing 
 very slow service at breakfast
 very noisy room construction all around at the moment
 the bedroom upgrade why did the website no tell you about this 
 nothing it was exactly what we hoped for
 room fairly basic but clean had everything we needed 
 noisy due to construction word and dlr nearby room a little shabby cables exposed to tv cracked wash basin in en en suite carpet fraying in places dated wallcovering didn t realise booking was for room without windows when reserving would regard hotel as 3 star at best
 wifi internet very slow and didnt even work and for a higher speed had to pay seriously we re in 2016 interent should be widely available free of charge
 price for the 2nd night 
 bathroom sink rather old and narrow with no catch in the sink shower was more modern and sufficient several flights up to room without a lift although a porter was available to help with baggage wifi access was good and complementary as part of the booking but required a new log in every 24hrs for each device breakfast not included in room rate which is a bit pricier than other hotels along gower street another potential drawback was the terms conditions of booking which did not permit a refund for cancellation or change post booking luckily we did not have any changes and arrived in time from a longhaul but it could have been a concern 
 our room was a bit noise noise coming from the ac system and the temperature regulation did not seem to work very well as it was always a bit cold inside the room it s a fine hotel in a fine location but its price level is also on the high end side 
 2 missing shirts and unlocked doir
 the cleaning staff outside room at 7am talking and making noise
 didn t advise that more than 1 person in a double room meant an extra 30 euro not advised on booking site 
 staff not always kind or helpful
 fancy bidet didn t work
 i did not like that i had to take 2 different elevators to get to my room and i also didn t like the narrow hallways the staff at the frontdesk was not quick to serve us another thing was the rugs in the room they should have been cleaned with a carpetcleaner 
 the breakfast was ok but i would except much more from 4 stars hotel the business point needs update the printer wasn t working the chairs were so bed i was worried i will fall down only irish newspaper 
 no bad points
 easier access ability to the shower 
 jag tyckte inte om att det inte gick att h ja temperaturen i rummet fast vi f rs kte att g ra det p inst llningarna p panelen inne i rummet rummets temperatur l g p 18 2 grader under alla tre dagarna och n tterna vi var d r samt att dom tydligen inte anv nder toalettborstar enligt personalen p hotellet det var ju om jligt att g ra rent efter sig s att ens partner slapp se det 
 internet signal was very weak inside the rooms rooms are bit small
 the breakfast was a little expensive for our budget but we enjoyed to food from the turkish place opposite 
 everything was good first room had a foul odor and the staff changed our rooms very quickly so we were thankful of that great customer service 
 a cracked glass was nt replaced by maid and could nt get reception on tv the last morning but it was nothing major 
 the english tv choices were very limited 
 opening hours for the spa were very restricted nothing to wow in any way 
 the bed comfort over priced
 no fridge in the room 
 breakfast bacon tough fruit hard sour and tasteless 
 bathroom is small and smelly 
 compulsory flipflops in the spa a tiny statement in the spa brochure goes completely unnoticed you only know it once you are at the spa reception already so make it bigger or more noticeable
 pool is small as advertised but it comes as a bonus enjoyed a quick dip to relax before dinner
 a bit aside from the very center if wien but 15 20 min walk is not a problem 
 breakfast food choice was great presented well and replenished quickly however it was so busy and cramped that breakfast was not an enjoyable experience 
 the shower would be much better with a glass door instead of a curtain which tends to move and stick to your body a bit uncomfortable the toilet door was not closing completely open spaces down by the floor and up near the ceiling therefore privacy is quite limited when traveling with your partner much better with a full door please 
 the room looked liked from 80 s and bathroom was horrible with low water pressure 
 need to wait for half an hour to organise parking 
 while sitting in the hall outside the restaurant area it s sometimes taking too long for restaurant staff to approach you and take an order experienced it only once though 
 nothing
 breakfast overpriced
 our room faced to the main street so you hear a bit of a city noise it is only brelevant if you are super sensitive to noise otherwise you will not even notice
 food after midnight the bar not to close 
 we travelled as a group of 6 2 teens 1 11 year old and 1 4 year old we asked for adjoining rooms but were refused and instead given 1 on the 5th floor and 1 on the 3rd also when booking a taxi to the airport reception hung up to get a 6 seater taxi they rang back five minutes later saying it couldn t be done they said we needed to take two taxis more money for the company they had a partnership with i told them i arrived in one so it was possible and to go figure it out again a few minutes later they were back and said a six seater was booked 
 the price of the bottled water in the hotel
 room was a little bit small however i could have expected this 
 no on site gym
 couldn t fault anything 
 place is not managed very well lots of little things don t work like online checkout billing room keys etc wifi is very hit and miss 
 the rooms were very old and tired furniture was falling apart carpets very dirty
 room and towels were not clean properly hotel did not pay attention to my request through booking
 the restaurant while it is now one of the best in london has become very expensive the breakfast is truly excellent but really doesn t justify its price 
 shower broke and they had to shut off our water for over 10 hours there wasn t any other room available so i had to shower at the gym minimal sympathy from management all the extras we were looking for weren t really there mini fridge did not work safe deposit box in room didn t have batteries and front desk didn t have replacements no king size bed but two doubles made separately cost extra to rent a sunchair and umbrella by the pool one tiny ice machine for the entire hotel that constantly ran out of ice 
 old fashioned in need of refurbishment equipment unreliable 
 nothing
 in what is called a cosy room the double bed was against the wall on one side making it difficult to get in 
 restaurant service was slow even though it was nearly empty when we were there 15 minute wait for 3 scoops of ice cream is a little extreme 
 the mattress made the bed too warm only cover was a duvet which was also too hot 
 the safety green light on ceiling nr entrance to room is very bright at night would be better if dimmed to reduce ambient light
 the bed was quite hard and there was a little bit of a draft the light from the phone and the digital clock was quite bright during the night 
 the first room i was assigned was tiny it was in the fifth floor and the ceiling was in an angle making it claustrophobic the second was on the fourth floor and had a clacking sound coming from the walls that was constant old pipes mod provably the third room was the one i stayed in the staff was very good in accommodating me 
 the draught beer in the bar was terrible two different brands from different pumps maybe the pipes need cleaning
 the fact that the bed moved easily wasn t helpful
 the price of the breakfast 
 nothing
 the lifts are quite small 
 i do love my wife but the bed was way to small 
 tiny place
 breakfast wasn t great beans were hard and cold no sourdough fries bread though we got the best crossoints ever and egg was cold and like rubber 
 the cooked element of the breakfast was poor
 the tea cups were dirty on arrival we also had a connecting door to another room i could hear the people next door really loudly which woke me up in the early hours of the morning and kept me up for hours 
 loved it all no dislikes
 the room was quite small clumps of dust and hair on the rooms floor massive food looking smear across the mirror 
 housekeeping did not do our room one day reason unknown 
 reception area a little sterile no welcoming lounge bar to enjoy a libation before dinner no fitness room despite webpage claims to the contrary breakfast expensive for continental at 20 euros pp incorrect instructions to operate the safe which the staff could not remedy 
 there was a problem with my booking and i was not told until i arrived for my stay we should have been informed before we arrived that was not very good and there answer to put that right was free breakfast for one day of our stay 
 the breakfast bar needs to be made bigger it is very narrow and you cannot get to the things you want especially when people are making and waiting for the waffle machine you keep bumping into people 
 my room was on the 6th floor at the end of the corridor and i was told it was a quiet room however this was defiantly not true it was next to the service area for the 6th floor with clattering and banging from the service area and the swinging door right next to my bed headboard meant i was woken up from 6 am if you are given one of these rooms ask to be moved immediately what is annoying is that these issues could easily be solved with better sound proofing anyway as for me i ll be back staying at the bulgari hotel next time i m in london i would have stayed their but they were full 
 the rooms are without doubt the smallest i have stayed in and as a result you are literally lying next to your door so if anyone at all comes through they disturb you the beds lacked any firmness at all i don t think it was the mattress but the bed frame itself which didn t support the centre of the bed 
 too warm in the room and we couldn t open the windows
 prices were 3 or 4 times the normal price all because of the salone di mobile
 a lot more expensive than quoted through booking com
 quite away from subway 25min walk but there was a bus during weekends 30min between buses 
 quite noisy at night rumble of trains generator take earplugs one of the lifts was out of order causing congestion not sure it was worth what i paid i expected a little more luxury for the price 
 found breakfast rather disappointing for 15 euros dining area could be better planned at breakfast time flow of people disrupted somewhat e g glasses not placed near to where juice is obtained and queues for coffee machines 
 i arrived and the place is chaos tons of families people running everywhere and 2 slow elevators that took for ever then key card didn t work to get in room twice the hotel had some electrical or computer problem and none of the new rooms were working took over 30 minutes to get in my room and i had no idea when i would while i was waiting i demanded my money back but because i paid on booking they said it was impossible facilities are far from glam basically furnished with cheap ikea like furniture one power outlet in the room breakfast was very mediocre business travelers should stay next door at best western atlantic not glam but easy and comfortable enough 
 the weather
 they didn t have a bell boyto carry the luggage just a trolly 
 the room was cold the heating was set to low 
 ac was not working well
 it was a bit loud outside on friday evening someone had a huge party in the next building what is really annoying when you are having a bad high haha just kidding 
 room wasn t very big but fine given the price and location
 lack of ironing boards once i asked for one
 bathroom is incredibly small bed is not comfortable 
 book a room with a view of big ben directly book a studio suite room on the fourth floor so it s at eye level i was originally on the 11th floor and moved to get the perfect almost eye level view studio rooms have a sofa area and microwave and drink prep area well worth it staff are incredibly helpful and accommodating about getting the correct view their concierge is excellent too going above and beyond in tracking a taxi i d left my passport in six star service 
 eccentric lighting system in the bed room reading light setting more akin to search light mode sleep setting put out all light so to get to the bathroom in the night meant crossing the room to put on bathroom light should be at bedside 
 they need coffee makers in the room 
 bed was extremely uncomfortable like sleeping on a stiff board aircon was stuffy and make it hard to sleep
 concierge too busy to explain service patiently to a tourist i was seeking advice to book extra night since email request before i left country of origin was not replied the answer is will take some time before he can attend as he is the only person on duty and a lot to do not friendly to help a tourist in need 
 the breakfast buffet should have been topped up more regularly as there was no bacon for ages even though we told a member of staff however due to complaining about this they waived the 17 each for the breakfast and apologised 
 the airco didn t work unless you took the card out of the system for light also we had to pay extra for the parking which was not clear when booking the hotel 
 the room old dirty carpet taps in the bathroom not working properly very small for the family with two children sofa bed for children age 7 and 11 not big enough piling paint from the wall in the bathroom small fridge with the only one bottle of water the room was not prepared for four people not enough soup 2 not enough shampoo 2 not enough tea 2 etc 
 too noisy the walls are way too thin there was a guest next door on the phone and could hear the whole conversation the floors were noisy when walked on the heating was also noisy the room was too warm and the staff could not turn it down 
 no tea making facilities in my room 
 just a tad disappointed in the room chips to the sideboard and looked a little tired in places the hotel is gorgeous though and we spent lots of time out of the room so didn t detract from our enjoyment 
 the decor was a liitle tired and we were disturbed on two out of three mornings by staff wanting to clean before 10am 
 front desk manager juliana was amazing but other receptionist were so slow
 nothing
 the only negative i could find is not with the hotel but with jamie s restaurant where we had breakfast one of the waiters was not friendly at all and behaved as if he didn t want us to be there and kept looking at us in a strange way it made us a bit uncomfortable 
 there could have been a better choice of teas and coffees and of toiletries in the room no biscuits either 
 service at breakfast was slow for an almost empty restaurant public spaces are limited in size 
 21 for parking i m staying at the hotel so i feel that this is a hidden excessive charge 
 superior room was very small only one bedside table bedside lights didn t switch off individually air con light shone onto bed at eye level 
 checking in was slow because of computer problems so we were upgraded to an executive room but the bathroom light didn t work there so we had to move again but were back in an ordinary room i think also the kettle was in a cupboard with a flap down door and in one room it fell on my husband s hand and in the second room it fell on my head a design fault i fancy we mentioned this when we left 
 the modern glass shower door was stylish but not that functional leaving a puddle on the floor
 no a c a bit noisy dark room with view of unmaintained garden kitchen boiler exhaust location good but expensive in comparison with other hotels that i have preferred no breakfast until 07 30 so not really aiming at business travellers 
 food is bit on the bland side as its as per european taste buds but very fresh mattreses need to be a bit more plumpy like hotels
 our door keys did not work after the first attempt the technician had to come and change the battery which delayed our trip out for nearly half an hour 
 nothing
 the old furniture that was chipped the bathroom equipments were old and deteriorated all the white things were gray or beige because of their age the nasty smell in the room the air conditioning was not functioning at all
 hour long wait for the room as it wasn t ready my daughter has been ill and has mobility issues we had planned the trip so she had enough time to rest from our journey and eat before going to rays of sunshine concert the hour wait in the foyer did spoil that sadly when we finally did get to the room there was still some rubbish in a bin and the bathroom could have been cleaner 
 the staff where really bad and i was late to check out the ring the police for me strange when it says they charge 10 a hour extra but i was 28 mins late they ring the police
 hotel is dated and needs thorough cleaning 
 softer outside seating would make the garden area more inviting to use particularly in the evening no bar area by pool
 noise children
 staff could be more friendly
 the hotel had old carpets that had their peculiar smells and the pillows smelled to humidity fongus 
 we stayed 5 nights but do not think the floor was vacuumed a little inconsistent with replenishment of tea coffee face cloths 
 the room
 the fact that the tv stations didn t correspond to the numbers on the most unhelpful guide in the room 
 only one small issue pillows were vey hard and uncomfortable
 location several bus stations from the metro 
 nothing
 i could start my day early knowing my luggage would b held b4 check in was not told 
 breakfast is the same for 7 days 
 the location was poor nothing around at all i booked the hotel on booking coms recommendation of close proximity to the o2 which yes we could almost touch from our bedroom window but it was two rail journeys to actually get there 
 leaving the key to the room at the front desk just not use to that the electricity went out once and there was a humming noise all night 
 nothing
 bar lounge is very strange they do not seem to care whether you are there or not service was slow we left during our first attempt we usually find this area in a hotel is important for quick or leisurely drop in but not here 
 be careful with parking on the streets 
 used the restaurant for a carvery meal one evening which whilst adequate could have been better however the breakfast was excellent great choice and presentation 
 a mini bar full but had to pay a fair bit extra almost a tease it being full i feel if you had to pay for them they shouldn t have been sat their waiting giving this was the first thing we were shown on entrance to our room we thought they were complimentary 
 fun to be in the old quarter but not easy to find recommend having taxi driver call hotel to get directions 
 kept catching my leg on the corner of the bed which is quite sharp gone home with a couple of bruises disappointed that there wasn t a bath but every thing else was excellent also would have liked another mirror in the bedroom when doing my hair 
 too far from attractions
 it s grade 1 listed with steep stairs so might not suit older travellers but they do have a lift 
 nothing 
 too far from metro station tiny room very expensive
 notting 
 everything is a bit out of date the bed is too soft
 staff were not very welcoming friendly
 staff in the check in desk makes me feel uncomfortable when my first language is not english
 few minor maintenance issues 
 need to encourage local authorities to finish work on the quayside which looked pretty shabby
 the only negative was that the beds were very uncomfortable no cushioning uneven and the springs could be felt surprisingly even our kids complained about the quality of the beds perhaps the hotel can invest in mattress toppers to make the beds better for sleeping which would then make the hotel ideal 
 working all around crossrail 
 the extra bed we had in our room triple room was a little camp bed not comfortable at all
 room with fitted carpets that need to be replaced noisy room because it was close to the maid s room bed matress probably too old smelling sweat
 there was no hot water either the night of arrival or the next morning i requested a quiet room and it was located behind the lift shaft i had to go to work the following morning very early hours so got little sleep a drawer frontage fell off when i tried to open the drawer 
 the breakfast restaurant not big enough far too hot and the breakfast covered in pepper
 room facing onto the road was a little noisy late at night but hey it s a city centre hotel 
 nothing i can think of 
 not a four star staff couldn t be bother except for the concierge guy 
 no bath robes when we were told the studio room would have them 
 it was a shame that our stay was just at the end of the refurbishment of the dining room etc which promises to make the hotel even better i also had a problem with operation of the tv which didn t seem very intuitive 
 everything were perfect 
 at 6 o clock in the morning someone made very bad noises very dark room no light very annoying old and small tv for the breakfast they put a small coffee machine which was very slow and produced small amount of coffee and you had to stand few minutes in a line of guest to reach it 
 too pricey for the room standard
 the noise from other rooms was very loud slamming doors until late at night wifi price most places offer it for free decorators in corridors without warning meant it was hard to manoeuvre a large suitcase and small child and avoid the paint 
 the decor was dated some bits of furniture were damaged and or dated i could here the neighbours on both sides through the walls
 the only thing we didn t like is that we didn t have time to stay longer 
 the pool is very small
 nothing
 it was all good
 the rooms are way too small
 the breakfast buffet was not replenished very quick during a busy period 
 very small bed 
 basement room was under a bar very noisy cleaner cleans at 3am horrendous could hear hoover banging and very squeaky floorboards very tired in the morning 
 smelly old fashioned and lacking in care although i have been informed renovations are under way 
 staff 
 wifi should be free pool and jacuzzi area needs refurbishment some parts are rusty and old 
 they changed the room at first registration and rooms were awful i will never stay at that hotel again
 breakfast not included and too expensive as an extra
 how noisey it was outside hardly slept all night window are so thin 
 hotel is a bit pricey but well it s paris rooms are small but still comfy 
 the shower wasn t working with hot water occasionally
 breakfast a bit pricey across the road breakfast half the price and very good 
 nothing
 sky top bar closed at 11 00 and was a bit small
 very old and tired hotel very poor eqiped dirty absolutely isn t 5 standard hotel 
 i was looking forward to dine at the hotel restaurant but they do not take solo guest limited to minimum two 
 room was very small shower was absolutely tiny room was very plain nothing more than a premier inn type also overpriced 
 i thought the tv channel availability could be better particularly sports 
 too noisy lifts
 when we arrived we were told that we were getting a free upgrade which of course sounded extremely exciting however when shown to our room it was just the upgrade i had already paid extra for 
 lift a little slow
 the breakfast menu is the same every day
 no restaurant 
 check in staff not so friendly 
 harsh noncooperation unnecessary expensive
 you can hear everything in the rooms next to you the walls a paper thin i knew the room was going to be small and it was tineh thankfully i wasn t in the room very often the bathroom was compact as well 
 no complaints 
 no complaints no faults thanks to rydges we had a lovely stay
 a old tired hotel with old tired funiture much in need of repair with tired staff who are only just courteous cold rooms no central heating working outside temperature 8 c only a small electric fire for heat 
 room was a little small and signage at the front of the hotel is almost non existent so if you re not looking you ll walk right past
 nothing at all
 no good sevice 
 room was very small and too much had been jammed into it very little practical hanging space better suited to the male traveller with shirts that women with dresses 
 no nice bar bit far from city centre
 few free parking spaces free
 only one lift was working out of two which led to some delays but nothing major 
 room was very small for a double
 can t think of anything really
 no fresh air or open windows and no fridge in the room room space very narrow never again
 twice in our 6 day stay the rooms was not cleaned until mid to late afternoon we would have preferred to have two regular coffee packets in the room 
 there were some mosquitos allready in the room when we entered quite bothering 
 small room not sure it was even 15m2 as advertised breakfast expensive for what you get 
 customer approache
 the bathrooms
 restaurant staff were very chaotic and some couldn t understand english one of the guests travelling with us asked for a knife as one hadn t been set and the waitress didn t know what he was asking for it s a restaurant this was my only criticism of the place bar that it was superb 
 no film 4 limited free view channels 
 very clean 
 we arrived by a thames clippers boat and although the hotel is not far we had to walk a long way around the fence to get to the reception by the same road as cars a gate for foot passengers arriving by river would be good 
 absolutely nothing
 the rooms are not very soundproof you could hear tv people talking in the next room very clearly and the room doors do not have any type of soft close function they are quite large and heavy doors and slam shut with the loudest of bangs doors were constantly banging through the night and for that reason had the worst night sleep 
 the furniture was a bit dated in the room
 parking was too expensive
 dining facility was extremely poor due to understaff kept waiting so long for our meal we left the hotel and found an excellent restaurant nearby if the radisson blu is offering dinging facilities then it should be staffed accordingly waiters and kitchen staff chefs the delay with our first course was over thirty minutes and no feedback from the staff as to the reason behind the delay it must be assumed that there wasn t any cooking staff on site 
 very very very small for the single person room hard to walk around the room after opening the check in luggage
 the room we were given was too crowded as a triple with the sofa bed open additionally i ignored the hotels that said the extra bed was a sofa bed but that s just what they gave us the carpet looked dirty 
 menu in hotel restaurant has not changed in over a year which is really boring for a regular visitor
 communal toiletries quite dirty
 difficult to find when coming from the airport good thing the taxi driver had a rough idea 
 food was awful room service and breakfast 
 shower cabin leaked onto bathroom floor and out to carpet in room cabin door did not close properly and as a result had no seal floor was slippery and then carpet also damp 
 parking and breakfast are expensive 
 my tv and the tablet did not communicate with one another and i was unable to access that function in my room it was frustrating and disappointing as i would have loved to watch something at night i also found a long black hair on my bed and it had no relation to anyone i allowed into my room which made me feel like the place wasn t cleaned properly and made me hope that my sheets were clean the hotel has no room service which is also slightly annoying there was no separation of all the lights being on or none so it was quite a harsh wake up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night 
 room was not cleaned or laundry changed in two days reported to reception when checking out
 nothing 
 staff need to be trained how to be professional and friendly breakfast was poor resturant was crowded late checkout is not possible without paying extra 
 it requires a make over or renovation the breakfast was extremely poor in quality and variety 
 i think it s fair to assume london hotels will have tiny rooms unless you spend a fortune however the decor made the room feel claustrophobic dark wood panels in a room of that size made it feel a bit like a coffin not that i ve ever been in a coffin but you know 
 see above
 we stayed in 3 rooms on the first night due to horribly noisy air conditioning systems in the rooms the first room s system made noise constantly we then moved to a second room where a loud buzzing happened about 20 minutes after we settled down to sleep this stopped after about 5 minutes and then started again 20 minutes later we were then moved to a third room and provided with ear plugs as they couldn t guarantee the air con would be any better the following night we were upgraded to a lovely room where thankfully the air con stayed quiet for the night 
 my room had a noisy generator outside which kept me up most of the night ordered room service and fish was extreme dry
 nothing 
 room was only really suited to single occupancy small double bed shoved up against the wall so when the one sleeping next to the wall needed to get up in the middle of the night both of us had to get up 
 not sure if someone took money that i left on the desk
 nothing
 wifi is free in the reception area only if you want it in your room its 7 
 there were many people asking for money outside the property and they seemed to be hanging around the metro station a lot 
 all was ok
 no drink water e g elect water pot supply we arrived late evening shops around were closed when we ask for staff they said only room service for tea or coffee no hot water provided even i ask to paid for it 
 nothing
 it s expensive like all london rooms i paid 170 for a family room for one night i have just paid similar in the past and got a much better room this price didn t include breakfast either breakfast is about 18 pounds and children breakfast for free i have stayed for example at mal maison for just under 200 pounds and this was inclusive of breakfast this hotel just wasn t as clean our room really smelt of smoke even though it was a non smoking room it had three single beds which is what we wanted but i suspect some people have used it as a party room also the room was a little bit tired shabby there was an old stain on the carpet and the bathroom needs a bit of an update the hairdryer was broken and had a bit of sellotape holding it together don t get me wrong it was ok it s just 170 is a lot of money for one night in a hotel it really is i understand london is also expensive however i ve come to expect more for my money and you can get better than this for 170 200 for sure 
 wi fi only avaliable in room on a pay basis
 the breakfast fee is little bit expensive for children it s the same for adults they can t eat so much 
 room was a bit small
 the size of the room almost ruined our vacation no space for two people to pass by one another not to mention the luggage basically there was no space to open it properly the bed was sticked to the window therefore there was no possibility to get out of the bed on both sides no room view if we were to open it or look outside we would have seen nothing but walls 
 internet was slow
 attention to small details in the room missed needed repeat report before action taken 
 room and bath size
 i know it s france but tea coffee making facilities in the room would have made it perfect 
 from our room the traffic noise was quite bad i know its london but that did disrupt my night not sure it was worth the cost nothing to complain about but i have stayed in equivalent places for less 
 the heating didn t seem to kick in very quickly on a night time coming in from 0 temperatures the blankets could have been thicker
 nothing
 not really a 4 star hotel based on thin fraying towels marks on the walls leaky shower doors and no coffee in the room unless you pay extra in a working class neighbourhood not on a tourist street 
 there should be directions to the hotel from gare de lyon as the hotel is not that easy to find when you step out of the station the street in front of the hotel is not well lighted 
 swimming pool was empty and internet sucks
 had to change room due to excess noise
 restaurant during breakfast becomes very dirty
 i was very much looking forward to staying at the ship inn but there is so much wrong with the hotel part of this property i was really disappointed my room had one of the most uncomfortable beds i have slept on for decades re the bathroom there were already items in the bathroom bin when i entered the room the spare toilet roll was a partially used roll and the shower sliding doors did not close properly the bathroom was overall clean but the shower cubicle could do with a good scrub as there is quite a bit of limescale re the room itself the sockets on one side of the room did not work the tv remote control did not work and half of the commands on the tv itself didn t either it was full of dust under the side lamp by the bed the kettle did not switch itself off when boiling water and the milk was past is use by date definitely overpriced for the quality of accommodation provided 
 no parking
 the tv in the sitting area away from bed didnt work we were told it would be fixed the next day but that didn t happen my husband was very upset and the maid left us with not towels on the same day 
 there needs to be more car park spaces available as its always full and you can waste a lot of time sitting in the car waiting for the next available space 
 the shower wasn t fully working
 would have been better if everthing wasn t extra surcharge to use the pool surchaege for wi fi etc luggage rack in room would have been handy 
 told we had free upgrade wpuldnt like to see the room before upgrade room we got was so small barely enough room to get ready comfortably also only mug for tea and coffee facilities 
 no problems at all
 only 1 small lift working most of the time causing huge delays easier to get on wifi at the cate on the next corner
 the area when getting there after dark didn t seem very pleasant we got there at around 22 00 with two small kids and at first they gave us a room with only 2 beds although we reserved 4 beds we had to go down again to ask for another room and they immediately gave us one with 4 beds 
 the shower is not powerful 
 location restaurant needs more selection
 bathroom tap fell off light fitting fell from ceiling staff told but nothing done in the three days we were there poor breakfast
 this place is totally overrated and overpriced staff was terrible and rude very far from amsterdam city center not close to public transportation 20 20 minute walk offers a shuttle service to the closest transportation center as well as the airport but these much like the hotel are overpriced and not very helpful
 the stuff was a bit strange but all in all friendly the bathtub is facing the wall if you have an eiffel tower view way is the bathtub facing the wall it makes no sense 
 bathroom i prefer a shower head that is detachable 
 ask for a garden room as the road is noisy lighting is rather too low and breakfast prices 
 the carpet in the room needs replacing and the toilet flush needed attention otherwise the hotel was good there are external factors which you may wish to consider if you like the window open at night be prepared for some rowdy behaviour and early morning deliveries but that s par for the course in central london 
 the furniture in a very bad shape scrached used and cracked the bathroom merror is broken the marble is also broken the bed is not comfortable at all its more of a 3 star hotel than a 4 star its in a desperate need of a makeover other than the location nothing good in it even the lobby has a mixed peices of furniture thats totally not mached it doesn t worth the money over priced ju
 luggage space in the room as you d expect london hotel rooms are slightly smaller and me travelling from australia with a large suitcase was a bit of a struggle where to place it so i don t trip over it as it didn t fit in the wardrobe but that was a minor thing the room was on the ground floor so i could hear the underground going so next time i will request a room on the upper floors as i am a light sleeper 
 price should be little lower
 nothing its amazing 
 the only thing i noticed when taking a hot shower was that the water went a little cold intermitantly this only lasted a few seconds and went back to hot water 
 there is nothing that i would change 
 i didn t
 not worth for the price interior of this hotel is more like 3 star bussiness hotel doesn t give luxury atmosphere specially at the lobby area also for the room interior was not that great as i said like a normal business hotel room
 rooms very small no bath
 the style of the room is minimalist
 nothing
 hotel abit dated staff neither friendly or helpful
 i forgot some jewelery they said that they did not find it 
 car park spaces were limited because of the concrete pillers so only 1 car would fit in every 2 parking spaces 
 bed was quite small and pillows too high for us but overall a great room very clean
 one thing i would say is that the pictures for the hotel could be more accurate its much nicer than the pictures show i was wondering why it was priced how it is but then when i got there i realized if it had a pool it would be perfect 
 got service email before i arrived asking if i need anything i am perfectly capable of asking for anything i need and i don t want to be bothered with useless email had to endure a long tedious set spiel from the woman checking me in trying to sell me a more expensive room i hate having to listen to a sales pitch to check in 
 the service in gail s kitchen was very poor due to being very busy and understaffed there was a hole under the table in our room 109 through to cavity which was blowing in kitchen smells unfortunately not the fantastic bakery smells there was also a confusion over whether breakfast was included in rate 
 internal room had no view 
 more choice of cereal more healthy ones
 no mint for my mojito
 be aware that it is not possible to cancel bookings made full price has to be paid 
 poor quality coffee for breakfast i couldnt drink it no machines available
 mini bar would have been good
 nothing
 very busy in july so reception always busy and a bit slow
 maybe i was a victim of bedbugs now i am suffering from its scars 
 basement rooms pokey
 the carpets in the room could do with changing lots of dirty marks and burnt through holes the walls were very thin and we had an awakening one morning by the neighbors also we would of liked to have been told about the builders outside of our window as we had to have our curtains shut during our duration so we could have privacy 
 the bed was not too good is almost broken the basin in toilet was not good the water was not flowubh properly
 the only low point was that i could not get the heating to work it was a bit cold in spite of the relatively warm weather as the room was in a very shaded area breakfast was a bit of a bun fight due to chav wedding lot
 nothing
 could only make coffee in the room i would like to have been able to make tea 
 rooms very small
 no outlets available except at desk hair dryer hard wired to the desk not able to utilize effectively food was not quality especially room service too noisy constantly being woken by noise
 nothing
 not much really if i have to say one thing is that it is not that close to the city centre however it is a 3 min walk to the train station and the 5 minutes to amsterdam centraal there s also a tram that will take you to the museum quarter so if you don t mind the train ride you ll find it easy to get to the main sights 
 honestly there was nothing that needed improving i would choose sunotel over more luxurient hotels 
 have to log in to connect to wifi every time would suggest a deluxe room due to a c seemingly not available in the other rooms although it wasn t very powerful we were upgraded to a deluxe room for free 
 it s bad manners of a waitress in breakfast buffet to let an eighty years old man who is eu dependent take an inconvenient and uncomfortable table even though i told her there s an old man at same time she didn t give direction to any other guest all the other guests found their tables as they liked don t discriminate any face at any time 
 small niggle but the pillows were very uncomfortable would benefit from providing a pillow menu like some other hotels or a least a couple of other spare pillows to accommodate guest needs the touchscreen tablets weren t the most responsive things in your universe which made simple tasks like turning off the lights rather taxing also lots of building work going on next door so not the greatest immediate view but we could see beyond to the gerkin from our window as i said only silly niggles 
 nothing
 poor communication about facilities from staff had to ask for an iron in room only found out contents of fridge were included in price when i asked about milk for my coffee 
 internet poor
 wifi was very slow 
 the mattress of bed was too soft
 the weather was quite hot at the time of my visit there weren t a fan or air conditioner either 
 breakfast is disappointing room size is rather small not exactly a quiet address 
 room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con wifi is not super speed as stated in fact i couldn t log on at all for our two night stay 
 nothing in particular 
 shower door inadequate
 all info on smart tv no bedside lights just one spot between two just a few teabags
 mattress was little bit hard
 no iron in room allowed 
 the single bed room was in the basement of the hotel near the staff quarters and the restaurant therefore there was a lot of noise and was difficult to sleep at times 
 didn t find the staff overly keen to help and the view from the room wasn t great 
 i ordered room service twice and it was not satisfied compare to price too salty and forgot to bring what i asked 
 breakfast is served in a basement room without windows which some guests may find off putting 
 bed was only a double and a little uncomfortable due to location you also heard a lot of traffic noise from main road 
 location
 no tea coffee facilities in the room apart from cups and kettle so we purchased our own tea in local shop come on savoyen this is the 21st century 
 the air con was not strong enough when the weather was really hot extra fan was supplied though 
 none
 nothing
 small lobby many coridors
 why put tea and coffee in the bedroom and then not supply any milk to be told by reception to go down the road and buy some was not quite what we were expecting 
 there was absolutely nothing about this hotel that i could fault 
 three major problems there 2 lifts only one was working this was a major issues with so many bpeople staying ion the hotel at the time but no apology was given for the failure of the 2nd lift not notcei was put up to indicate that only 1 lift was working a lot of the other guests we spoken to in the lift comnplained about this situation the air conditioning in the room did not work except to blow warm air the room was very stuffy and warm even thought the air outside was cool and breasy very pleasant outside like a sweat shop inside extremely poor because the windows only opn a few inches it was difficult to get a good airflow into the room very unsatisfactory breakfast because i did not book breakfast until the day we arrived i was charged approx 22 x 2 for 2 breakfasts approx 44 this is extortionate if we ever stay with you again we do visit wembley for a couple of days each ocasion at least twice per year we will look for breakfast at macdonalds across the way premier inn only charges i think between 9 and 13 for breakfast x 2 26 some approx 20 less that what we paid at novotel and its good breakfast only marginally less good in quality compared to novotel wembley 
 the hotel is clean and well kept however the decor is in need of an update
 i miss having coffee and tea making facilities in the room this may be an austrian thing though 
 room might be a little small for two but great if you re staying by yourself 
 nothing
 saturday was the very busiest day for breakfast not enough staff on duty meant long ques 
 wifi a bit temperamental
 busy hotel
 the early wake up because of the cleaning stuff
 the bath in bathroom could have been cleaned bettet
 the double room was slightly on the small side however the room had a balcony really great plus and the bathroom was spacious shower very powerful and complementary toiletries also an added bonus 
 durring the summer the hotel was not ready with the appropriate romm and the reception was too busy we had to wait too long for any request and one of the room we recieved was accupied by another guests and the other was without air condition only the third room was ok 
 expensive and the absence of a breakfast buffet more vegetalian vegan options at the bar restaurants would be much appreciated 
 nothing
 there was nothing we did not like about this hotel 
 choice available for an evening meal a bit limited would be nice to have more lounge comfort in public area 
 small room
 the room was red hot but the air con was the loudest i ve ever heard so couldn t sleep with it on a beeping noise then kept us awake later on in the night i was running a race the next day and was shattered
 was too far out
 5 hotel and missed bathrobes in the room strange for such hotel level bathrobes have been arranged to the room after telephone call to reception water in shower drained very slow as drain pipes most probably partly clogged
 air conditioning faulty and locked on full power at 32 degree
 bedroom really nice except shower too close to wardrobe when two people trying to shower and dress at the same time
 one family friend travelled hours to meet us left a message at reception he was in the area after leaving the hotel 2 weeks later we found out they never gave us the message 
 nothing
 overpriced during new year s eve
 room could do with a little tlc maybe 
 the room was cold and it was only when we called the reception they turned the heating up we seemed to be unable to
 some members of staffs service lack of ingredients for cocktails at bar poor quality nachos in bar and length of time i waited for service 
 it was 4 star hotel and they didn t have bell boy so we had to carry our stuff our friends checked in the same day before 3 p m but they didn t let us check in until 3 p m as we arrived at 11 a m the cleaning wasn t very good and it s over prized for the services and doesn t include breakfast i won t recommend it to any one
 bathroom room is very narrow uncooperative staff i request to arrange for early check in as my flight reatched 8 am but i can not find any cooperation from the hotel staff i have to sleep in reception till 2 pm to take the room
 breakfast wasn t free
 no mini bar in the room 
 not a great view at the back
 the staff could be a bit more helpful they were not rude also but they could try to appear more friendly when serving customers 
 not one thing
 my only criticism was the pillows the spare didn t have cases
 the room smelled like mold unfortunately no wi fi and tv not due to the hotel as it was an outside road accident still i think the hotel should have offered something back for the trouble occured
 having no tea or coffee making facilities in our bedroom dust was visible on surfaces in the dinning room when we had breakfast 
 the rooms of the hotel were smelling we changed rooms twice because a window was broken and cold air was coming inside the lounge bar in the hotel felt like a pub and not a lounge at the hotel it smelled very strongly of beer the restaurant had not charm and was connected to the bar of the hotel which made it noisy very disappointed for a crown plaza hotel and very expensive for what i ve got 
 expensive and impractical parking rushed check in lousy wifi with poor coverage and largely temperamental 
 pillows and room decor
 i don t like the way people will come in and use the hotels facilities stay there all day take up all the seating not order anything and make it difficult for hotel guests to enjoy their surroundings as there is nowhere for them to sit i believe there should me a minimum spend for non hotel guests 
 would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room 
 rooms are dated nothing special staff not welcoming
 location is remote no food or shopping area around management is very strict i had to pay 80 euros for checking out at 3 00 pm 
 the breakfast place 
 no complimentary mineral water
 i booked better room executive but was only with one bed was no option with twin 
 a lot of noise from the street
 1 i didn t like the fact that they took a 150 deposit one week in advance witch was not stipulated in the booking com presentation 2 i didn t like the fact that the rooms from the photos are not acurate 
 2 of the lifts were not working mini bar not stocked this is poor in any hotel let alone a decent one view from window absolutely shocking suggest you make sure you request a decent view
 little noisy but only to be expected given the location sunday check in was very late due to their lazy sunday policy so didn t get into the room until 4 30pm arrive at 10 30am should make this clear on booking
 nothing whatsoever
 rooms were a little on the small size but comparatively similar to other european hotels 
 there was a construction site on both neighbouring houses however the rooms are soundproof so it didn t bother us as much as it could have bring tour earplugs just in case the pool and rooftop bar closes at 7 pm it could be open later 
 breakfast was not good bacon quite dry and eggs 
 location is more suited to business travellers
 had to leave
 nothing
 there is no aircon rooms can get very warm in warm weather 
 1 they didn t give me double bed 2 there was no minibar in the room 3 the room size was small it was t worth the money 4 the towels were not enough 5 we had to wait for 20 minutes for a table for breakfast
 the buffet breakfast looked a bit poor but actually it was very tasty 
 real double bed and one big quilt more tea english breakfast and much more milk to make it with
 clealiness of the room upon arrival was not up to expected standard as toilet was not cleaned properly and not flushed 
 a bit dated and cramped 
 all was excellent 
 car park costs
 pillows not comfortable
 nothing in particular room a little on the cool side but not uncomfortably so some of the decorations a little on the tired side but this is an old traditional property would recommend and have no hesitation in staying again 
 our bathroom smelled liked cigarette smoke the entire time we were there 
 slow service too busy being cool 
 burger was cold and chips looked reheated not worth e15
 tiny rooms place needs refurbishing
 avoid this hotel if you want to enjoy london without being scammed and burgled housekeeping is an utter rudeness entering our room without a knock on the door on our first afternoon and cleaning up our room the following day when we have clearly put a do not disturb sign booked online through the hotel s own booking site for our extended stay because we were offered a lowest price or otherwise 25 discount guarantee when we finally found out that booking com price was cheaper they refused to give us their guarantee talked about this issue to the manager in charge but seemed there were near nothing they can do unacceptable for an establishment of this calibre 
 it s definitely not 4 stars room decor is dated and items were broken not cleaned thoroughly but it was a quick trip so didn t bother me
 check in was a bit slow only two people on service at 6pm peak time but really a minor issue 
 staff was helpful but not friendly as other 5 star hotels in the area
 how brown the room was
 no detail in room regarding restaurant or bar menus and no opening times for leisure centre the restaurant should have been open on event days all day we arrived when it was just closing and waited a long time for bar food
 rooms are a bit small with not much space to store clothes but the beds are big 
 just a little cramped to get passed the desk to the bed and the bed was really hard 
 not applicable
 pillows on bed
 rooms with no a c
 wi fi internet could be better
 tea coffee limited
 the scrambled eggs could have been warmer 
 it was a cramped inward facing dark and depressing room 
 the shower had a crack in the tiles 
 booked double room instead was given triple room with single beds when i asked for the room i d booked staff gave the impression that i should be thankful to get a room i did get moved on my second day but the disruption and staff attitudes spoiled my short stay disappointing for the cost
 the postcode given for the hotel sends the satnav crazy returning you time and again to greenwich park in front of the observatory a dead end staff admitted they had been told this but were uninterested in passing on the message tip substitute n for the w at the end of the postcode we requested a quiet room but it wasn t at all quiet the room was only just about big enough for two with one hard chair or the bed to sit on so not very comfortable 
 the front desk staff were not customer oriented especially one staff called jenine when we were checking out we were treated with respect 
 thought the parking was overpriced 
 the room was so small it was ridiculous
 didn t like climbing into bed to find someone had knocked a bucket or bottle of water saturating doona sheets and down to bottom mattress
 too expensive not value to the room charge room service is lousy and also hv a carry charge to the room despite the food is very simple outside shop is much better
 room was first floor overlooking the road and suffered with noise causing a disturbed sleep could do with additional glazing 
 none
 rooms under the roof are noisy when raining
 service for breakfast in the morning had to get menus ourselves had to ask someone to take our order after people who came in after us had their order taken got offered tea or coffee and didn t receive after 10 mins waiting and seeing others get theirs it so had to ask a another member of staff to get it for us scrambled egg was runny and orange 
 not enough milk and tea in the room
 rooftop staff a little difficult to catch the eye of when we required drinks 
 pricing for extras could have been clearer didn t know cost of mini bar or laundry service until we checked out we should have called to check however it would be good if there was a detailed price list on arrival 
 no dislikes all good 
 i did not appreciate that an extra 50 deposit was not mentionned during check in while pre authorizing the credit card i just happened to see that the amount was different to the cost of the room remembering some of the reviews on tripadvisor i asked to pay the 50 deposit in cash which was no problem and got it back when we checked out the bathroom was very small even when you were in it alone you could barely turn around comfortable also the side of the bathroom facing the room bed has frosted glas which is not stated in the hotel s room description whoever is in the room can see what you re doing inside the bathroom which might be okay when you are travelling with your partner but not so much when travelling with a coworker not everybody wants to expose themselves when showering 
 staff
 breakfast close at 10 little bit early for us
 pricey but was a busy week end in paris small room despite not being the lowest category 
 minor things such as no kettle to make coffee with ingredients supplied reported and never fixed coffee mugs chipped no soap in bathroom shower screen missing handle and there is no clock in the room these little things stop us from giving a perfect review 
 breakfast needs to be better in taste and options
 room size is no as advertised
 nothing
 reception bar and restaurant area are all being refurbished later this year which will bring them up to the standard of the rest of the refurbed rooms 
 everything poor
 clear signs indicating where to go when getting off the elevator 
 the check in was very frustrating
 it was a little bit noisy during the night 
 rooms are very small and swimming pool is more an attraction rather than a pool
 nothing 
 all good
 disappointed breakfast was not included when it stated breakfast on booking
 awful 2 out of 3 of our party had to have their room changed one due to the dirtiness and mould in the bathroom the other due to the leaking air con 
 my doughter s crashhelmet was lost the rooms were too small and cold so we had to change the rooms when we we changed the room the housekeeper forgot to bring one of our bags to the new room and when we asked for it they said that it is lost
 we struggled with the lack of internal stairs as one of our party is unable to use a lift and had to be escorted through the trades areas to service stairs and we were left waiting several minutes outside in the cold as security staff never had a key on them to let us in via the fire escape stairs but if you are fine with lifts it is a great hotel 
 19 per person for breakfast is very expensive 
 nothing needs improving
 n a 
 nothing can think of my views from experienced career worldwide business traveller working in 37 countries incl resident director multi national corporations and working on foreign office committees yep global traveller so know something about hotels 
 the floor was not cleaned for a 2 days 
 prices did seem a bit high a kitkat from the mini bar at 3 50 seemed rather excessive 
 nothing
 you can t ask guests to pay for biscuits and at a pound a packet i didn t eat any 
 no control for heating small wardrobe space and nowhere to hang coats the room was very big though so not much of a problem 
 it was a mess under the bed on the floor 
 a wider choice on your dinner menu 
 stayed in a superior room which was nice but i don t like having a fixed shower head in bathroom it s inconvenient buffet breakfast on a sunday is chaotic they run out of food plates etc resulting in lengthy queues waiting for refills catering staff seem to have little anticipation and an inadequate sense of urgency managerial staff swanning about quite unconcerned quite unacceptable a new serving system or more staff required 
 breakfast hall was too tight
 slightly out of the way of la rambles which could be a good point if you want it less busy 
 we were change to different hotel from one i looked at bedroom was very small to what i seen on internet had to squeeze around the bed to get in the other side toilet very small not 5 star 
 the curtains were see through there were lights on outside all night long which made it very difficult to sleep even though overall good experience the curtains are a deal breaker 
 ridiculously expensive 
 non
 the room was very small almost to store the luggage 
 no breakfast service available 
 everything about our stay in the room was poor nothing like the descriptions given and photos shown dirty smelly and uncomfortable 
 the hotel is in an older building and we found the room became very stuffy late in the day the ac system was dripping on our arrival and while some maintenance work was done one day it still did not perform well in addition the room was much smaller than indicated in the pictures we viewed online we had booked an executive suite with sitting room and sofa bed to accomodate 3 adults the mattress on the sofa bed was not optimal 
 the bathroom had a tiny bit of mould dirt in the shower but besides that the place was really clean 
 staff was rude and a nightmare to deal with we were there on our honeymoon we were treated poorly and the staff was incompetent when it came to helping us navigate the city if you are just staying for a night it s fine we were there six days and would never stay there again 
 it was a bit difficult to get around the bed for the kettle etc also wardrobe too small to hang anything up 
 nothing
 no windows to open to get fresh air 
 slow staff poor service concierge not very helpful
 small rooms from reception to my room i spent 5 min walking nothing in the fridge the toilet chair was broken 3 days and they didn t fixed i hear the trains noise
 no iron can be provided in thee room we had to pay for pressing 
 small room but comfortable a lttle noisy as overlooked the street 
 one of the two bathrooms needed a little attention with the grouting 
 lifts were temperamental and the bedroom and bathroom were tiny not good value
 hotel is tired in need of major face lift our bathroom floor got very wet due to i ll fitted shower screen there were tiles missing from wall not what you expect from a 5 hotel more like 3 staff not overly responsive to complaints this is our 2nd visit to the hotel 1st visit wasn t great either having to wait over a hour and half for our food in restaurant staff were not overly responsive then either it could do with good clean in reception saying that location is fabulous and that s about all hotel has going for it it s such a shame because it could be a wonderful hotel 
 room was very small and needed refurbishment
 poor internet at pool side
 housekeeping could have been a little tidier ie bins emptied nothing horrendous 
 during my first time visit in 2016 staff assigned a room with private bathroom and during this stay the staff assigned me a bathroom with sliding glass door that can see through it made it really awkward when my friends came visit and i had to take a shower 
 check out was slow but did not put us off visiting this hotel again
 2 lifts broke down on sunday morning which was a real problem especially as i had a child in a buggie a very long wait 3 staff at reception is not enough people for a hotel as busy as the pullman had to wait too long to check in check out and get queries answered 
 table service in sky bar was sloppy we ordered the same drink four times before giving up manager very apologetic though and gave us drinks on the house 
 superior room booked but was in the ground and without windows 
 pillows were a bit soft but did detract anything from the hotel which was first class
 the sound isolation in the hotel is horrible we could barely sleep waking up at 08 00 every morning due to walking sounds the hotel does not handle over bookings well we had to argue and almost cancel because the room we requested was originally not available eventually we got the room that we asked for the air conditioning is very weak the hotel lobby is extremely hot and the hotel apparently controls your ac you go to sleep with ac on and wake up with fan mode full of sweat then you call the reception to find out they manually disabled ac for your room the toilet room is not very private and not isolated you can hear everything going in the toilets as the only thing used for separation is a sliding wooden door 
 there is a free wifi but you cant get a signal in your room for a 4 stars hotel they could do better air conditioning is very poor 
 nothing about it was as portrayed on their website the entry and check in was extremely sub standard the room was only accessible by numerous stairs and extremely small with the toilet and shower in the bed room in full view no walls the view out of the room was to a very close brick wall the entire hotel was very dark we were told by the staff that it was an hour from the eiffel tower yet it comes up under the heading of hotels in close proximity to the eiffel tower we were charged an extra 30euros to be put in an only very slightly larger room that was accessible by lift with the toilet in its own little room again with an awful brick wall view when i requested to take photos of the original room that we were given they refused to let me have access the only attractive thing about both rooms were the bed linens the staff were very rude when we voiced our disappointment
 we were disappointed with our room which had no carpet felt like we were staying in a kitchen the bed was also very hard uncomfortable the breakfast was very basic bland overall the hotel was very below what i expected by the reviews i had read before we booked it 
 stale smell throughout property very dated and tired throughout dirty lack of cleanliness tiny bathroom toilet was in the way of standing at the basin shower curtain as old as me basin so small you couldn t fill the kettle under the taps windows dirty and paint peeling off lovely view of scaffolding outside the window to our room went down for breakfast the first morning no seats available were told we had to wait until somebody finished their breakfast before we could have ours a lady in the kitchen was plating up breakfast using her fingers picking up sausages and bacon with her bare hands we did not have the breakfast on the sat or sun of our stay for obvious reasons when we asked to see the management we were told he only works mon fri 
 bathroom
 parking was far and too expensive 
 front desk at check in the girl was not nice 
 difficulties with card authorization and long period for deblocking the amount afterwards 
 i cannot think of anything i would like changed
 the ordered taxi transfer was delayed by 40 min i was about to lose my flight the staff tried to do their best to fix this problem and offer me to pay for the taxi at hotel otherwise the taxi have to go to nh hotel at airport and i should pay there 15 min in my case it was to much please implement the possibility to pay for the taxi directly at hotel and find more reliable taxi company 
 quite expensive
 
 single small milk carton each 
 there is really poor internet connection must be solved the problem especially in the rooms wireless doesnt work properly there is really nice garden however nobody serves outside so you just could have walk in it dont dream to have your drink
 the front desk receptionist who assisted us when we checked in needs further training in customer service he was not welcoming to be fair the front desk staff who assisted us in our check out was very pleasant 
 air conditioning did t work and it was 33 had to open windows but it didn t help much breakfasts are poor the stuff was not quick to react on absence of products 
 thin walls so i could hear my neighbors
 parking is too expensive 
 the air conditioning didn t work in our room but this may have been switched off as it was march
 very busy hotel no character
 leaving 
 expensive breakfast
 we asked for a quiet room and it was very quiet but also a bit dark 
 the pool is tiny not really meant for swimming 
 they were having work done in the next room but we were not informed of this when we checked in
 room condition poor quality minibar with half empty products old furniture
 breakfast was limiting
 nothing
 nothing to complain of 
 the standard room was too small enough for 1 person but with 2 people it s too tight 
 the bathrooms were a little small
 we booked a smoking room as both myself and my husband smoke but were surprised that the windows didn t open at all although the air conditioning was enough to keep the room cool and air circulating it would have been nice to let some fresh air in even if it was from just a crack 
 slow internet wifi not working like it must in 50 of time 
 staff not helpful with guiding on attractions in the area
 we were close to laundry room and it was too noisy at night and in the mornings but just a small minus 
 on the website it showed molton brown toiletries in the bathroom and the ones we had were not molton brown
 the rooms were tired and dated very dark decor tea coffee facilities we re poor bathrooms needed rupdating lnot sparkling clean shower doors not secure beds uncomfortable needed duvets and feather pillows toiletries nice wallpaper coming off walls
 the room was a little small for the rate but this is central london and it wasn t too small to be an issue 
 we were looking out over a car park but we weren t in our room that much to be too bothered
 the hotel is in a pleasant residential area with lots of restaurants and bars but it was further from the centre of milan than i wanted and the wifi was not included in my tariff
 i
 poor tv reception no satisfactory response from staff when this was raised no c4 no radio 3 or 4 rather high daily fee for internet 
 the choice of music played on occasion in the background
 the room was somewhat run down sink broken down and courtesy robe was ripped to shreds on the sleeve 
 there was no privacy bathroom had glass door with no bolts the moment you switch on the bathroom lights the entire room is illuminated no sound proofing in the room the door opens straight towards the bed this was the king room the door is so slim that it lets all sounds out and in we were woken up by the alarm of the guy across the corridor cleaning is not up to standard you are met with dirt the moment you open up any cabinet or even the minibar 
 limited out door area
 was little pricey
 nothing
 bed too small
 unstable wifi value for money the bar area is dark lack of service and booring breakfast is busy 
 nothing everything was great 
 i dislike the information sent by the hotel management on the date of our arrival at vienna austria we were sent to another hotel mercure josefshof in vienna which is located far away from the state opera building i ll inform this unhappy and non respectful behavior of the hotel management staff to the management of accor hotels 
 i had made separate bookings and they charged me twice they refunded me back in 3 days 
 that you couldn t open the window and their was no lock on the door
 electricity was shutting down about every hour first day but finally they fixed it 
 no bath g
 rooms were really small which was fine for one person but i would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult there s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway 
 the air condition is not so good for it always feel like cold when i stay in room even after i increase the ac setting to higher temperature 
 blinds did not provide full privacy in room
 the ac was not working they promised me to fix it but they did that the next day my children could not sleep the whole night because the room was hot
 being asked for a 50 00 deposit which we should have been made aware of at time of booking thru booking com
 only problem was that there was a projection at the end of the bed which my husband tripped over a bit of a hazard at night 
 slow service especially at breakfast no hot water in our bathroom tap no tea coffee facilities in the room paying for wifi should be free in a 5 room very basic for a 5 
 no coffee or tea in room
 dodgy wifi
 bathroom too small shower almost worse than useless a great deal of money for an average ish stay 
 no fitness center wish staff had repaired steam room at spa so we could have enjoyed this amenity for at least one day 
 bathrooms too small should rather have a proper shower v a shower sheet in the bath rooms look tired and needs renovation
 very expensive not great value for money
 very poor furniture and room service care many comments about the bathroom cleanliness and daily care telephone in the room not conected to anything as i wanted to make some calls or even reach the reception but it wasn t working the bed got only vely light cover sheets everynight we felt cold and had to switch off the ac 
 i could not use my hilton honors membership because i booked via booking com
 breakfast way overpriced
 stayed at executive rooms on 21 f water pressure weak so weak that we were reluctant to wash hair so we went to diagonal mar mall opposite in search of hair salon had a hair shampoo blow dry 
 we thought the price of 19 50 each was excessive for a breakfast when you can get a full breakfast down the road for 6 each didn t try it so maybe its the best breakfast you ll ever have it should be for that price anyway 
 checking out at 11am too inconvenient
 nothing
 for 80 euros i gave was perfect the actual prices that the hotel advertises for one night were more than 500 euro per night it sounds like a joke for a hotel like this i called for an extra pillow during the night and the receptionist was alone so i went down to the reception to get the pillow if i paid the original price i would get very mad 
 the bar area was filthy there were tables that needed to be cleared and cleaned and one of the tables had a leg missing 
 nothing 
 nothing 
 the high price for a room
 early checkout 11 00 
 to wait for the hot water it took ages doors and carpet is asking for some repair 
 service at breakfast and in the bar a bit slow especially when they were busy on our second night we waited almost 15 minutes for drinks because part of the bar was closed for a corporate event open plan bathroom no door to the toilet shower and bath just a partition wall to the bedroom pool and sauna area a bit disappointing no jacuzzi and the access was through the reception and bar 
 immediately adjacent to a pub so a bit noisy at times but it is a city 
 the room was on the small side and the shower did not turn off i would request a larger room in future 
 some reception staff not very helpful when i asked about where to find restaurants and bars in surrounding area 
 very very old hotel two very small lifts and there is always a queue not so great quality breakfast same spread everyday staff is bored and couldn t be bothered much about a customer we travelled with a baby were refused to have a milk bottle warmed up in any of their microwaves 
 the hotel is undergoing renovation so there was quiet some noise during the day in my room with the air conditioner
 
 carpet stained with blood drops flagged to reception but obviously ignored by housekeeping reception immediately offered another room despite booking com stating 1 room safe 2 pay per view channels neither were available 
 room was noisy early in the morning when the bins were being collected no view from the room as the windows all had obscured glass 
 expensive room with view only of slate roof over st pancras station we should have been warned of this prior to booking the hotel staff didn t make us feel special they seemed more caught up in being staff of a prestigious hotel
 food and drinks were naturally paris prices a little high 
 nothing 
 i didn t like the fact i had to go home 
 the stains on the curtain headboard walls 
 our room 369 was next to the lift and it could be heard every time used reported that i would like to move rooms no response was told engineer would be to sort it no engineer and no move or contact from staff room not cleaned on day one on our return at 10pm had to wait for it to be cleaned 
 our room had a poor shower but this was only problem encountered 
 i don t recall any issues at all 
 nothing
 only niggle was that breakfast could have been included or had a reduced rate for restaurant as it happened we couldn t use the restaurant as there was no chef i am a northerner and an english breakfast is very important 
 furnishings and mattress seemed a bit worn
 hideous reception desk and cramped lobbies area room was not as on website disabled access bathroom and we are not disabled poor facilities in room cheap toiletries poor tea coffee marking facilities would not come again
 water not free
 noise isolation from within the hotel could have been better
 this hotel is in a pedestrianised zone so if you have a car then you have to phone ahead to let them know you are just around the corner they will then lower the bollard in the road to let you in it costs 25 euro per night for parking so it is better not to have a car basically but they can help you if you do have one 
 balcony would not open shame as it was a lovely view price of the bar was very expensive beats staying at a hostel but comes with a price 
 nothing 
 the coffee with breakfast was terrible but the food was good at breakfast
 the view could have been better
 the bathrooms were not cleaned properly 
 the room maintenance especially the shower and toilet are not 5 star hotel maybe 3 also breakfast can be much better for this price
 the hotel is expensive and a bit worn
 thestfof hotel gave us room for disability person instead of regular room after our complain they replace it it incorrect standard double bad is to narrow for two person also the hotel charge us for5 nights acc to our booking in spite of our notification that we will deley one day and stay 4 nights it is incorrrect 
 uncorfotable terrible bathroom ascensor always busy 
 nothing
 i need to add the point of marriott member ship they refused to add to my card and said if you booking directly to hotel we add to you if you booking from booking we refused to add your points so please make all necessary action to add my points 950749093
 not too keen on glass doors leading to bathroom which don t close lock 
 loiterers and their dogs on pavement next to the hotel
 nothing
 bathrooms are a bit of a trial
 nothing
 room was confusing could not find the light switches bed comfort was just ok 
 only staying one night
 was a bit chilly in the room 
 when i booked the hotel i booked two queens rooms to be given one queen room one budget room once we found this out 2 hours later i complained to the reception we did get the correct room had we of been on our own and not with friends we would have been ripped off by being put in a budget room on floor 2 instead of the queens rooms on floor 9 not happy no sorry from staff ever 
 the room we paid extra to have a larger room with a four poster bed the pictures of this type of room were lovely with drapes on the bed posts i was expecting lots of oohs and ahs but in fact the room was tiny and the four poster bed was just bits of wood awkwardly sticking in the air at each corner also the breakfast could have been better quality but for the price paid it wasn t bad 
 wifi could be better
 hair from previous visitors was everywhere
 not clean poor sound isolation
 we didn t take the breakfast because 18 for breakfast is expensive at the metrostation we bought bread and that saved us a lot of money it can be very hot in the room so maybe a fan would be handy 
 a damp smell in our room 764 not very nice unfortunatley but apart from that a great stay 
 nothing
 strange bathroom setup doors a little dangerous
 the staff were so serious
 have to pay to use the gym
 breakfast room not in the basement 
 restaurant was closed on old years eve 
 shower was small

 nothing to improve on really we got a parking space by chance so perhaps more spaces but i feel room is an issue 
 always have to queue for breakfast and most selections had run out at 9 50 only to be filled up at 10 28 when breakfast finishes at 10 30 disorganised wish the waiter wasn t constantly eating chewing as he came out of the kitchen 
 the food in the restaurant monalisa was of average quality probably after 9 30 pm the buffet should be avoided
 having to ask for bathroom toiletries then having to go down to reception to pick them up didn t like having no tea coffee making facilities in the room
 the room didn t come with tea coffee making facilities we had to ring room service who eventually brought one out to us but considering it s a 4 star hotel i would have expected the room to come with this as standard 
 the roomsize is as often in london at the lower end of the comfortable range it would have been to small for staying with two people 
 breakfast was ordinary felt like i was at sainsbury s caf reception desk staff were a little arrogant and showed little knowledge when i queried an issue everything seemed to be a drama 
 as this is a fairly new hotel i think staff were quite disorganised my husband booked the room for me on his card and when i arrived i was told that they would need to take payment from my card for security reasons staff members then knocked on my door three times the next morning to clean the room even though i had the do not disturb sign on my door and had explained to them that i was staying two nights nice hotel and friendly staff but overall very disorganised 
 nothing very very minor niggle is the sliding door on the shower was quite stiff but that s grasping at straws 
 tired worn carpets in hallways swimming pool was good but the tiles could do with cleaning as there was a dirty rim mark the whole way around the pool but over all it would be fair to say it was clean enough 
 the sink is not functioning well
 rooms r v small few collection in breakfast no lopy few other facilities not that good location
 decor bit dated bathroom was clean but unpleasant smell from plug hole
 room size room cleaning
 very low connection of wifi
 we stayed at a number of other mercure hotels during our recent trip and this hotel is a blight on their chain definitely the worst mercure we ve ever stayed in the lift is a disgrace and has to be experienced to be believed it is halfway down a long and narrow ground floor corridor and is the size of a shoe box with non automatic closing doors the addams family would be right at home in this lift the overall feel of the hotel is that demolition would be a kind renovation the only thing that saves it is the location close to the airport service is ordinary and the breakfast is overpriced do yourself a favour and catch an earlier flight so you don t have to stay there 
 the room was not ready for 14 00 well so we just had a drink at the hotel bar while waiting for not more then 5 minutes 
 no make up mirror high step in shower bath low shower water pressure 8am no mattress pad cold pirelli tire like poached eggs disorganized evening buffet w poor quality cold food poor service w no beer glasses poor reading lights
 furniture in the room is old 
 staff need more customer service training was charged for minibar but never used it
 this is a silly question or maybe the fact we didn t select to have breakfast because that looked great too 
 noting stood out particular the option of a bath would of been nice as my partner prefers them but wouldn t stop us from using the hotel again
 but far out limited choice in restaurant nothing for vegans 
 staff and service in the restaurant was not adequate for a 5 star establishment 
 the staff
 didnt allow early check in breakfest too expensive king room facing the street was soo loud you can literally hear people s conversations walking the streets car noises etc for whatever reason the room temp was so hot we modified the temp and put it lower but made no difference which made it difficult to sleep
 bed mattress was very hard lumpy due to the springs coming through and old bathroom could have been cleaner also appears very tired soap holder was coming off the wall only had one bath towel between us but 3 hand towels 
 if you are not able or prepared to drive it is a bit hard to get to by public transport a shuttle to one of the tube stations would be great 
 the shower tended to flood and the room was a tad small as the bed as it was huge took most of the room
 a bit difficult connection from the airport with 2 changes 
 breakfast was expensive we didn t have it there are plenty of caf s nearby 
 i didn t appreciate being overcharged on roomservice when i questioned it i was told they didn t have a allocated button for steak so i got charged an extra 2euros for hamburger not acceptable and not a very good variety on room service i paid 14euros for steak that i couldnt eat requested really well done and it came rare our room was across from housekeeping store so noisy in the mornings 
 room was a bit run down
 wifi connection very bad 
 room was way too small and didn t look like a 4 stars hotel dirt on the wall floor and seats i want with my partner and we had two single duvet i ve asked for a double one but it wasn t possible i ve paid 166 but i found that it was overpriced
 everything 
 small room
 hotel is cramped delux room is small bathrooms are dated no mini fridge overall i expected more from a hotel like the double tree 
 quiet location in eixample is a bit of a walk to barri gotic
 pool area roof terrace viewing area was being refurbished and sometimes closed this was one of the main reasons for our stay roof was a building site works and cranes workmen on site 
 we didn t like at all the policy of the hotel to charge parking moreover the pricing of the parking looked very expensive to us about 24 euros per night 
 no negatives but the double bed was just two singles pushed together 
 i booked and paid extra for the club room as it gave access to the club lounge every other club lounge i have been in offered food and free drinks including alcohol and this was what i expected unfortunately this club lounge turned out to be a very small room with a coffee machine with no coffee in a facility to make a cup of tea and a few other things i was very disappointed and felt i had been misled i would not have paid extra for this room had i been aware of what little was offered for the extra money on the website of other hotels in this group the club lounge looks worth the extra money but people should be made aware that this is certainly not the case with this particular hotel 
 beds are rather old and could be replaced with new ones
 wifi wasn t working properly very annoying the windows couldn t be open properly be on the first floor small room so not so much space to walk
 very expensive bar
 asked for a double bed but got two singles pushed together not a massive deal though still very comfortable
 fortunately we brought our own pillows yours i m afraid are extremely hard the bed was firm which suits me the sink tap was loose but did not cause a problem the shower had a week flow but did the job the bathroom power point for shavers etc did not work i overcame this by my own two pin adaptor where i could power up my tooth brush 
 didn t get much sleep due to other visitors banging doors and noise coming from other rooms till early hours in the morning walls are very think so could hear everything 
 the staff gave the impression that they were only interested in getting as many people in and out as quickly as possible rather than taking the time to ensure individual guests needs were met despite the hilton literature dotted around the hotel promoting the opposite other than that a pleasant stay 
 it was true to my modest expectations so it was fine by london standards 
 no tea coffee making facilities in room
 bed not so comfortable some noise saturday night from other guests
 room a bit small though understandable for the price in london 
 the cold of the room
 the bathroom could be a bit more clean the breakfast is a bit stressful a lot of people a large hotel running around tables without a lot of space breakfast quality and variety can be significantly improved 
 the only problem i had was with the shower the shower head actually the control handle to adjust for temperature did not work and it was not very comfortable using the other one below i was told that a solution would be found but then did not hear back they did take a look at it and see that it was not working but then i did not hear back about it 
 my room was freesing and they didnt fix it until the night time not good since i needed sleep in the day had to upgrade to a room i did not want since the room i ordered was not availeble had to pay 50euro extra
 very small bed
 air con not very powerful imagine this would be a problem when it s very hot 
 the pool was unusable as it was not heated and closed by dinner time each night the environment for the pool was uncomfortable as there are paying customers right beside it eating meals watching you swim we chose the hotel for the location and the pool and we were so uncomfortable using the pool that we only spent about 3 minutes total in it no fun being in your wet bathing suit while people are annoyed with you because they are eating their dinner 
 the value of the money not worth it no hair dryer or slipper in the bathroom
 no coffee systems and irons in the rooms
 none apart from the fact that prices rise as everywhere in london 
 no room service or food available when we returned late night but only a minor issue 
 there is a bar downstairs so it could be quite noisy when i slept with window slightly ajar there was a little smelly when i first entered the room the housekeeper didn t clean the room even if i ask for it 
 although i specifically requested a larger room we didn t get one i ve stayed at the hotel a number of times so i know there are some i wasn t looking for an upgrade just a bit more space 
 my room had a musty stale smell about it and the facilities did not seem to be well maintained 
 the interconnecting room and the cost of it 
 service in the bar staff virtually ignored you unless you sought them out
 breakfast was not nice there didn t seem to be any type of normal british tea
 slow and confused reception
 we had to climb 8 flights of stairs with the kids 80stairs we arrived on hottest day of summer however it was larger apartment than what we had paid for to be honest i had to work off all those croissants at breakfast 
 booked a twin room which was very small the shower was squeezed into a corner which made it impossible to shower with ease 
 rooms too small lift didn t work steam room didn t work reception uniform jeans this is a contractors hotel for excel not really a couples romantic weekend hotel
 some of the staff was rude and not helpful the maid open the door in the room even if you have the sign don t disturb they didn t clean my room the hotel is a little bit far from centre and taxis are very expensive
 that was the worst stay i ever had in my life the stuff are too rude they charged me 200 euros because i smoke in the room and i m not smoking they convinced me that the will just block the amount from my credit card till the investigate and once i checked out the deduct the amount i have tried to contact them and they never reply back the room is too small and it smells bad but i think that s their strategy to force guests to pay the smoking penalty even if you aren t smoking no one from the management their only one person at the front desk and he s not professional at all based on my stay i don t recommend that hotel at all you will spoil your stay 
 nothing 
 tea was not to my liking or the milk
 the bar should stay open longer than 1am 
 the restaurant although well decorated was so how glommy with no view
 price of breakfast and certain items ridiculous policy of obtaining at the time of check in credit card autorisation for cost of full stay plus 30 for incidentals wifi slow
 the pool chemicals turned my six year old granddaughters blond hair a greenish colour also a drain smell in bathroom was at times unpleasant 
 didn t like anything and would never book it again 
 rubbishy a c we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm i would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months appreciate that lower windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue
 the tea coffee refreshments in the room was a little hit miss on replenishment
 the rooms are small
 nothing
 i found not everything was present in the room as described no dressing gowns or slippers the milk etc was not replenshed every day the walls in our room were very dirty the chair had cigarette burns the rubbish was not taken away each day 
 no complaints
 stinky beddings
 small hard bed hard pillows
 they weren t able to print my boarding pass and didn t offer a substitute choice it was sunday and no internet caf was around 
 the a c is not cold enough they need to do something with it i talked to them and still the same
 hugely dissapointed by the discount code qrs for the attraction sites that didn t work the barcode was scanned several times at the ticket office and it didn t work which meant we could not get a discount on our tickets waste of our time and money 
 staff
 hotel was very unhelpful to change the booking date bed uncomfortable staff extremely unhelpful to offer us an alternative early breakfast 
 bathroom fittings and maintenance shower did not function properly 
 our 2nd floor bedroom was situated to the front side of the hotel it was really noisy being so close to the road with sirens and fast cars it made it difficult to sleep also it needed more staff at peak times i e evening room service and morning check out 
 room too small
 the hotel staff was polite but i thought they werent all well versed enough in knowledge about the ciites attractions and services for a 4 star they should have that info at hand rather quickly 
 the noisey generators by our room
 service
 didn t have long enough there 
 no mobile phone reception and intermittent wi fi signal in my room despite being disabled was on 4th floor which was wholly impractical when we had a fire alarm during our stay room was cold 
 what didn t we like everything where to start we paid 630 on a special deal for 4 nights stay the rooms were small the decor was very worn and old with a cigarette burn mark on one of the covers my towel had a rip in it which tore more when i used it the place smelled of stale cigarettes there was a cigarette burn mark on our bath the lift had a sticky wet patch on the floor in a different place every day from what looked like the bottom of a bin liner there were bleach marks on the carpet by the lift on the second floor which looked like vomit one day our room wasn t made up by the time we got back at 3 30 we were then just given clean towels 
 need to follow up request for coffee and tea service in the caf lousy 
 at first i was accomodated in a ground floor room in the main building i reminded them that during reservation i requested a non ground floor it seems that they don t receive the requests made at booking com i was reallocated to a different building across the street on a high floor no elevators the add says that the hotel has elevators at least the staff carried my luggage to and from the room this building looks a lot inferior than the main one uglier interior no hall no front desk then safety perception decreased not good arriving late night at a building with no front desk at least key card required to enter no elevator it is far unfair that we pay the same price to stay in such inferior building the room is very small but i must say that it seems to be normal in london the bathroom had almost no space the space between the shower box and the sink is too narrow can barely fit a person with arms down quite a chalenge to brush the teeth or comb your hair the shower drain was partially plugged so after 3 min of shower i had to turn it off before the shower box overboard and flood the bathroom floor had to live with it for 2 days before they sent someone to fix it narrow space between the bed and the walls on both sides 
 old fashion furniture 
 the room was in the basement there was a window with natural light so it s not as bad as it sounds but one never likes to stay in the basement 
 massage at spa
 had room problem on arrival but soon changed all was ok
 breakfast was disappointing chaotic buffet with unattentive staff
 the breakfast area was very noisy and the chairs scrape along the floor 
 nothing 
 room is small and bathroom and bath very small lift and landings are unattractive
 rooms
 distance from center it took more than the described 15 minutes more like 30 min by tram was hard to arrive after evening flight
 nothing
 nothing
 small rooms but that s the city centre for you
 the hotel needs more signage hard for people to find
 ac was not initially working at all after the staff worked on it it only partially worked for the remainder of our stay 
 no air condition in the hotel rooms except in exec rooms according to hotel staff no information provided about that in advance or on the web site 
 being in the basement was fairly noisy and would have preferred to have been on a higher floor was woken up early from workers etc 
 a little bit cold air conditioning doesn t have heating function a little bit small room 
 breakfast was not included in the price and was expensive and not very good 
 nothing we did nt like
 the window at the front rattled and was not very good at reducing road noise poor water pressure 
 was disappointed that we didn t have facilities to make a cup of tea in the room and the bathroom was on the small side 
 clean envoirment
 we paid extra for a view however on boxing night the lockside cafe opposite had a disco til 3am its normally on to 1am on a sat so ask for a room on other side of hotel 
 experience
 not too much negative stuff to report as this hotel is very good however there was clumps of dust and hair on the floor upon arrival in the room yuk bathroom cube floor not cleaned to a high standard daily either each day the floor dusty n hairs this stopped the hotel being ten out of ten 
 all is good
 quite expensive
 the expected queen bed turned out to be twin beds put together 
 hotel is not a 4 star hotel it is between a 2 3 star old and worn furniture dusty curtains cannot close a window properly i expected a small room but a better standard from 90 night
 we visited the hotel as a group to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday when we arrived we were given our room keys and made our way to the basement to where our rooms were as we descended the stairs the smell of paint was very obvious however there were no signs to suggest decorating was taking place to get to our rooms we had to step over paint trays full of paint and to my annoyance when i entered my room i realised i had got paint on my new shoes and all up my trousers the following morning painting commenced outside our bedroom at 7am waking us all up and to gain access back to reception we once again had to complete an obstacle course to exit i took photos and showed them to the management who at the time did not say much when i checked out they had reduced my room rate however not the other two rooms in my party who had encountered the same experience and did not offer to replace my now ruined new shoes or trousers very disappointed for the price we paid 
 the bed was very very unconfortable extremely small room in wien you can find more hotels for the same value closer to the centre parking is in the public garrage staffs are very nice 
 got biscuits with our tea and coffee facilities on our arrival but none after that
 the staff was unfriendly and the hotel is in desperate need of repairs our room had rotted wood on the doors and windows the a c did not work there was mold in the shower tub definitely would never stay again
 the bed was a little bit smaller than the expected in the delux room 
 i paid over 250 and was given a disabled room i was treating my partner for his birthday and was very let down to say the least 
 being new facility some tweaking still needed especially in shower section
 room and standards were awful first room had people s things in it when we got into it total incompetence and no effort to offer any discount if we wasn t so tired we wouldn t have stayed 
 service in the restaurant on saturday night was rushed we were the last couple in 9 30 meal ok but last course it was obvious that that the staff wanted away was going to have last drink in there but opted for good godfreys 
 the usual london experience of a tiny room with a tiny bed but well laid out and so quite manageable there s a bit of traffic noise but quite minimal at night only one tiny lift again not unexpected for a london hotel had the irritating modern bar fridge where you get charged if you so much as touch any product so you can t use it to store your own stuff 
 room could have been a bit bigger for the price 
 bar service room service
 nothing 
 we told the hotel before we were going that it was our first trip away since we had our baby and asked for robes if they weren t already supplied because of this it would have been nice of them to acknowledge that 
 we couldn t stay longer
 quite old four star hotel small the breakfast is very average 
 the cost of the food 
 we did not stay long enough
 1st room not clean but they changed us right away 2nd was all fine i guess was a random thing wifi need to insert a new code every day wifi signal on 1st room not that strong on 2nd all fine room small same as in most hotels around in that area
 lots of hassle on check in too much documentation needed for a uk resident the room was very very small 
 pool and gym is laughable the room was very midget size 
 given a disabled person s room and didn t like the bathroom with shower curtain
 being in the basement of the hotel which felt like the broom cupboard 
 in one of the days there was not hot water for showering the ladies at reception need to be more friendly 
 nothing to dislike 
 not enough light in the rooms
 only one lift went to our floor which was not explained to us on arrival by the receptionist 
 highly incompetent staff with poor personal skills i was part of a group of 12 people family with children with 4 rooms for 5 nights stay during a voice controlled dispute about a quoted rate not being honored a manager ripped my phone out of my hands and then called the police the issue was thankfully resolved by the general manger who realized how inappropriate his staff had acted prior to this act i mentioned that i would be contacting booking com to let them know about how they are not honoring the rate i also mentioned that i would be posting a review on the manger s aggressive demeanor i then proceeded to take my phone out to take a picture of his badge when before i even took a picture he had ripped the phone out of my hand borderline assault this all took place in front of my children and family there were numerous other issues but obviously this was the most striking one i will never stay at this hotel again 
 lovely food in the resteraunt however it felt like it was so busy we were looked over quite a lot 
 room was way to small for the money i paid
 old building so floors were creaky and other guests footsteps were loud to be expected in historical structures small when compared to other big city hotels in this price range but again this is not the fault of the management prices at the bar very high internet was poor overall a great place but i think it s overpriced
 dinner is a little bland for me 
 lifts too many times went to top floor and back down again not too much of an issue 
 our room was difficult to reach from the lobby we needed to go down the stairs and take a lift just to arrive on the same level as reception there was no direct lift walking access to the same floor so having several luggage pieces it was not easy breakfast just one objection the chocolate cream was really not tasty at least for nutella lovers 
 the hotel is disorganised dependent on which staff member you have 
 room is a little on the tiny side but has everything one may need including bath robes and a little desk plus tea and coffee facilities no restaurant is present at the hotel it was not a problem for us but could be for some 
 the stais are a bit a challenge but it gives the hotel its special parisian charm 
 tried to check in twice and was unable to got put into a smoking room eventually which was hot stuffy and as a non smoker the smell was really bad 
 the hot water in the shower is connected to the room ac ask the staff for the correct setting before you take two cold showers like i did the lift wasn t working for my stay which could be a problem for some guests 
 room a little on the small side
 n a
 i was served drink at the bar in absolutely filthy glasses before we went to a concert decided it might be a one off and would give it another go but later on that evening the same thing happened twice was enough to make me decide that i wouldn t be staying there again
 a residents lounge bar would have been good as the bar area was rammed and difficult to get a drink or have a conversation 
 we had a serious leak from the shower ceiling when opening the water did not really bothered us though only one couch on a 2 people s room sometimes was not comfortable the hotel public areas are very dark dark colors to the walls not much lightning night club vibe we felt that there wasn t enough light on the room for makeup for example the air dryer was weak better to bring your own 
 room smelled airco did not work properly and noisy due to service elavtor next door
 found the man on reception a bit rude
 the bed was so small for a couple the bathroom was dirty behind taps in bathroom it was all rusty the bottom of pan in bathroom was dirty the windows in bedroom manky the breakfast in the morning was cold dont know how long it had been lying would not stay there again 
 the only downside was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room
 pool was closed booking com did not inform us before we travelled caused a lot of upset hassle on our wedding anniversary trip booking com refused to speak with us but thankfully the hotel stepped up to the mark 
 room somewhat cramped
 i did not realise it was a non smoking hotel so my bad 
 limited coffee in room and no creamer no wash cloths 
 on the third floor no lift not disabled friendly bathroom cramped whole of upper floors sweltering hot breakfast area in basement and also too hot
 no coffee and tea making facilities in the room
 old furniture
 when staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the club lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade i thought this was a bit mean spirited also we were awoken at 8 20am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them
 breakfast service was poor no menu just help yourself to lukewarm food tea and coffee not fresh and only provided after long wait 
 room wasn t ready on arrival and after being told it would be a few minutes it took an hour and a half before we gave up and went exploring very poor customer service 
 nothing
 we were moved to hotel close by and told we would have an upgraded room but the room was dirty crumbs under chairs and dirty toilet it was on top floor with sloping walls and only a small window this affected our feeling about our stay 
 nothing around in case of want to walk to at night 
 trains passing the hotel noisy at times our room was facing the railway lines upon arrival we found that ur re booking was not confirmed via booking com and had to wait a long time to get a room 
 check out a bit slow only 1 on duty ok once another 2 appeared dining room on saturday night was almost unbearably noisy outside of building rather uninspiring 
 wish they had rooms with 2 beds
 the decor it was too dark and small very modern and no place to relax if you didn t want to stay in your room finally it was a sunken room with stairs leading down to the beds i think it s a bad idea to have steps leading to the bathroom especially if you are trying to go to the bathroom with minimum light you could trip slip 
 everything went right
 the queue system for cooked breakfast to be a little more obvious
 beware the tub upon exiting my tub after showering i discovered the material in the bottom of the tub to prevent falls had been worn down and was of no use as a result with the left foot part way out of the tub my right foot slipped on the slippery tub base resulting in my falling hard again the sides and bottom of the tub i was lucky to not have hit my head the tub was narrow and had very tall sides and because the tub was wet after the shower and no traction it took almost 30 minutes to find a way to get out of the tub i was alone in the room very very scary i am not a young person and a month later i am still recovering from strains sprains bruises pain etc resulting from the fall they did offer to change me to a room with a regular shower nice offer for another day but did not help for the fall already taken 
 horribly overpriced tired dingy bedroom slow lift before going to the bedroom i was that i had been upgraded unbelievably small room rubbish shower
 the towels in the bathroom could have been a little bigger for showering and the window in the room we had wasn t able to open 
 nothing
 the shower drainage was poor but once reported to staff they were going to get sorted 
 breakfast not included in price 
 the bathroom was see through abit uncomfortable with friends
 the service is not well organized
 nothing not to like
 building works outside but told they will be finished soon 
 nothing we didn t like but a tip for other travellers with a car the one way systems make it difficult to approach nearest car park is other side of the piazza del duomo at autosilo di diaz you won t need your car anyway for exploring 
 wifi didn t work when i was in our room or by the pool both on 5th floor 
 wifi in the rooms should be for free
 breakfast should be available which was unfortunately not 
 mini bar was not always accessible 
 nothing
 nothing 
 price of breakfast we chose to eat out 
 spa wasn t great 
 my mother and i had a little uneasy feeling at night entering the hotel entrance because the naibourhbod didn t seem the safest still was liveable and i recommend it 
 location of my room and also room was quite small
 we was tree days at hotel we get room with bathroom for persons with disability there is no shower cabine all bathroom was wet after showering tv remote control too complicated 
 just the terrible weather 
 rooms very small and claustrophobic foyer lounge eating areas very noisy 
 the room tended to be stuffy despite the air conditioning could be very hot during summer room 15 requires a climb 
 slow receptionists very little rooms
 nothing negative about this hotel 
 lift location and way to receiption from lift
 
 more milks in the room for the tea and coffee 
 bedroom was a disgrace very very dated old and smelly terrible beds we asked to be moved and the room was less smelly but equally bad on all other fronts tiny bathrooms just extremely disappointing all round air con heating didn t work just a fan blowing that couldnt be turned off 
 lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open 
 i was in room 1224 i think and the elevator outside clicks and clocks like a gun every 5 10 minutes but shabby to be honest i don t like gun s i am comparing your hotel to the park plaza victoria in amsterdam that hotel is top banana 
 nothing 
 disappointing dinner in the grill room
 not made up in water at the coffee machine daily cleaning housekeeping
 value of money not as much as we have also the breakfast was very poor of choice and too expensive
 w c room too small and dark 
 the first room we are booked in did not have sound on the tv and aircon did not work so we got moved to a smaller room and the aircon stopped working there too no refund or reduction and we had trouble sleeping as it was so incredibly hot in vienna in august staff just kind of shrugged when we complained about the second room not working either considering air con was the one must have on our list we would not come back
 the suites were incredibly difficult to find we had to ask several people this could be approved by putting the name of the hotel on the confirmation 
 just a small detail it would be perfect if in the room there was a second curtain thiner than the current one for letting pass the light while having some privacy as the actual one stops all the light and you cannot see through it 
 the room isn t so spacious but for one night is quite good 
 no negative comments to make
 nothing
 i truly can t think of a thing it was great perfect spot to stay
 20 charge on my credit card upon my arrival as a guarantee this is bad for a 4star hotel and i m still waiting to be reimbursed
 bit far from center
 size of the rooms
 small bed small lift windows into yard dirty curtain 
 there is clearly an ongoing problem with homeless people sleeping just outside the hotel and when you re window is right over it all you can hear is them yelling i had to call down to reception to tell them to call the police because they were having a fist fight i would recommend that the hotel work with the police and the city council to try and resolve this problem 
 nothing it was perfect
 tiny room too expensive better deals with other hotels 
 no room service no food after 23 00 never experienced that in a 4 hotel when getting back from a concert and not wanting to eat overpriced junkfood from the street the absence of room service or some fingerfood at the bar was a disappointment
 room was a little tired the bed was made each day but not fresh toilet smelt a little funny but there was an air freshener supplied 
 in the evening we asked the receptionist to order taxi to the airport for the next morning the answer was it s impossible now you should do it in the morning 10 15 minutes before next morning half an hour before leaving i asked the receptionist another one to call taxi and the answer was you should have done it in the evening it s too late the taxi arrived in time but those endless minutes of waiting 
 lack of a bar for an evening drink was disappointing
 unfortunately the girls on the desk were distracted and weren t very helpful when we arrived they told us the nearest beach was to be reached by going to barcoleneta metro station and then walking from there we were very disappointed as we had looked forward to a walk by the sea and a swim this meant we spent all our time getting metros into the city for everything on the last day when i asked again about getting to the beach a different staff member told us it was a 10 minute walk we couldn t believe it that wrong information when we first arrived really had a bad impact on our visit we were also told there wasn t really anywhere to eat nearby which also wasn t true we discovered we also found that we could have walked along the beach into barcelona which we would have loved to have done please make sure that your staff know the local area and take the time to give good correct information on the whole though the staff were wonderful 
 breakfast was terrible only 1 loaf of bread small amount of jam and a small amount of fruit offered no croissants or cooked food offered have stayed here before and breakfast was excellent but not this time rooms were too hot 
 if it was within 5mins or so walking distance from the centre
 stuff is not helpful at all i will never reserve this hotel anymore
 room too small
 lack of storage space for anyone staying more than the average which i would guess at about two days very noisy roof bar and very crowded reception area 
 rude unhelpful night staff terrible room smelt of urine and was like someone s attic no gym and fitness facilities go to the one in canary wharf it s so much better room service don t bother answering calls 
 everything was perfect
 bathroom is a bit tired
 the level of comfort did not correspond with the magnitude of price increase for executive room besides the hotel charges extra for wi fi in a room the extra charge was waived for me only because i fainted at the reception when they informed me 
 stale bread and food for breakfast from the previous days 
 the price of the bar expensive the cleaners entered our room 3 times whilst we were asleep felt like we were being pushed out even though check out was 12 and this started at 9 30 
 the a c was not working and they change the room and also it was not
 things like carpets are begging for change they look awful smell from toilets on the corridor wasn t nice as well lift wasn t working but we could get free drinks as apology for that fridge doesn t cool very well but all in all it is decent hotel for that price in london 
 location and the room 
 the bedrooms are small which is typical of london hotels
 worst nights sleep ive ever had in a hotel beds rock hard staff wernt bothered room was extremely dusty and likr a broom cupboard 
 i tripped on entering falling face down leaving me with 2 blackeyes and swollen nose and swollen lip fortunately at the moment nothing more serious the step is not easily visible needs some thought perhaps better medical help more available like a serious ice pack 
 the behavior of the staff and flexibility of them to accomodate the requirements
 the room was on the small side and the electronic maid service alarm kept buzzing in the night and at times in the morning 
 expensive room is a little bit expensive traditional british breakfast is pretty expensive
 nothing this was a very enjoyable stay 
 hotel refused to keep our small travel case whilst we went out they cited security but we said please look inside at our little case and you can see it is not a bomb whilst we can fully appreciate the need for high security this was compltetely illogical and caused us a lot of hassle the receptionist had said we could leave our case in the case store when we checked in 
 it was some noise of workers
 some plug sockets near the beds would have been good the windows didnt open
 no iron only laundry service
 really noisy
 lifts not working when we arrived porter available for bags tired legs had trouble making up stairs 
 breakfast could have been better
 my money was stolen in my room 1530 and i am 100 sure it s was taken by one or some of the staff 
 the breakfast was a bit ordinary no real complaints 
 poor customer services on arrival
 the walls are very thin between bedrooms 
 breakfast queues ridiculous clearly not enough tables for the number of guests
 while very organised and efficient i felt the personality of the gentlemen at reception left a lot to be desired especially when the room including breakfast was over 300 00 he told us he was giving us one of the better rooms with a view of the marble arch and park however when we got to our room it was an on street view to a convenience shop across the street disappointing as i was celebrating my 40th birthday we said we would take the deluxe king size room however our room while very nice was very small and was no bigger than the usual standard double rooms that i have stayed in around the world there was only one chair so when breakfast was delivered to our room on a trolley table only one of us could eat at the table i ended up clearing off one of the bedside lockers to sit on not what i would have expected from such an establishment to conclude i wouldn t stay here again as i felt it was staggeringly over priced for the room we received and the service given 
 price of mini bar items
 restaurant food was way over priced and not good room phone didnt work bed could have been softer 
 very old furniture
 located in not a very nice area of london and the tube station is a fair walk you have to use taxis really 
 don t have
 never anyone at reception and on checkout a drunken man was asleep in reception area
 it was slightly upsetting to realize how well we could hear the people walking and chatting past our room the noise is not a nuisance in itself but it means we have little privacy as the bedroom starts right after the entrance door there is no corridor leading to the room which could provide some privacy 
 lack of towel racks sink spout no toilet brush 
 probably the cos of breakfast
 robes in room more luxury items in room 
 see above also hot water rather violent but better than not having any at all 
 the bar area felt clinical and sparse however the bar staff were good
 the amenities is not refilled each day need to ask staff in lobby hotel to get shampoo and soap
 no tea in room only coffee
 it can be placed fabric slipper and better quality shampoo and etc 
 30min train ride from city centre
 definitely not boutique standard room 
 need more variety in restaurant 
 a little smell in the lobby and club
 nothing
 no smoking area no balcony
 the little bug in my bathroom
 it was quite noisy rooms need better sound proofing
 air condition practically doesn t work
 thank you to let me tell you my experience i had during the breakfast the last monday 12 at your comedor the chef a laidy did have very bad manners with the employees may be she had bad humor that they but me and my wife felt very sorry because of them this i consider unusual whit all the people who attend un during my staying couldn t be better thanks again 
 nothing
 rooms are very very small
 limited dining choices and range of menu and difference between food stated and food delivery
 note suited for families with more than one child 
 breakfast was ordinary but acceptable for price 
 strange beds high pillows and no alternatives when i spoke to the night porter 
 the old tv but it was not really important 
 a little too far from the center of town 
 pool very small
 bathroom maybe needs updating 
 no fridge in the room 
 the in house catering is provided by jamie oliver s enterprise suggest you book for a weekend evening meal as many non residents eat there this was not mentioned to u s so we had to wait about an hour for a table for 2 on saturday for what you get the food is a bit expensive but you are paying for the name and london location 
 man on reception gave us room 008 room was very small and we are quite tall persons i asked him to give us nice room also i came yearlier than my partner and i waited for him around half an hour before reception guy allowed me to go room when i booked room i didnt see that there is additional question about second person in a room that is why reception guy said i need to wait for my partner because booking was under his name trainee lady blond glasses on reception on 20 of june has very pleasant personality 
 price to pay to have a good location so depends on what you wish
 expensive breakfast
 a bit expensive
 uncomfortable bed matress stiff arched in the middle the floor appears somehow dusty
 none hotel was fab
 given a room on check in in the basement opposite construction site there was a worker standing at the window moved us after i complained to another basement room on the other side we should have gotten this room in the first place 
 nothing 
 nothing really well i asked for a double but it was two singles but that doesn t bother me
 shower had a drain blockage and because it did not have a tub the water crept out to the rest of the bathroom had i not noticed and stopped shower bathroom would have been flooded attention to this should be paid for rooms with no bath tub 
 nothing negative at all
 nobody told me i had to pay 100 when checking in for any extras we may get i don t mind paying it but would of liked to of been told this when booking i got told i would get the money back when i checked out despite calling the hotel 3 times i still have not had the money back after 3 days not good customer service 
 the music is too loud in the caf so that the staff can t really hear what you say 
 would have liked more choice for children s menu in the evening and slightly firmer bed
 all good we had a great time
 standard rooms were very small our room had a used towel and a dirty bathtub when we arrived but we were upgraded when we complained 
 helpful friendly staff
 strange dripping sound coming from corner of room shower regulator didn t seem to work properly 
 bed could have been comfier needed a new mattress
 staff at the restaurant italian girl when we finished our meal but still were having drinks was notoriously asking us to leave saying that she has other guests we were not informed upfront that the reservation is time limited that wasn t a good experience very small room no electricity plug ins in the toilet not enough light in the room no gym in the hotel
 nothing
 there wasn t any welcome drinks in room fridge it used to be once this is downgrading the service 
 the lifts did not operate correctly on numerous times the lift would not accept my card to go to room 4
 i didnt appreciate being greeted by hair in the bathroom my wife wasn t impressed 
 nothing 
 the cleaning products used were overpowering extremely strong scent and lingered throughout our entire stay even without having housekeeping come past the 1st day 
 trams made a lot of noise 
 nothing
 the signage to get to the hotel should be better where net jets have a sign by the land rover garage so should you
 hair dryer and coffee maker didn t work had to move to another room because there was a water leakage we did get an upgrade with a nice view wow
 disappointed with the new savannah restaurant very slow service we waited twenty minutes before our wine was brought to the table the food was average and portions were small we didn t have breakfast the next morning the carpets in the public areas look shabby 
 room and bed getting tired needs a refurb but kept very clean
 it was very warm inside no air conditionjng we opened the windows to cool down but the bouse of trams and other traffic firced us to shut the windows 
 very dated decor in need of refurbishing no bottled water in the room 
 nothing
 bedding was old very small rooms and below average breakfast that s offered
 the room was miserable way too small for 2 people you could hardly move around the bed 
 the cleanliness and the room was very small compare to the price
 a little detail would be too consider how many people are in the room when it comes to teas and coffees etc we only had 1 bottle of water 1 each of the coffees and 3 each of the milks we wernt overly bothered as we were not in the room long a little tricky getting out of the shower as the door is level to the floor and as it is a walkin shower wetroom its difficult to put the shower mat down
 no time to stay longer 
 very poor food christmas eve menu food not cooked turkey dry inedible breakfast in executive lounge fault on heaters cold scrambled egg and sausage would not ever go back to the waldorf london also paid for other facilities but pool and leisure closed on christmas day 
 cleaning ladies too early and noisy
 nothing 
 the hotel is very big and i found the breakfast hall realy huge despite that the staff were friendly in a polite personnal way
 we ordered breakfast one of the days and it was terrible 
 clean room to look at dust and hair covered the pillow if it slipped down the side of bed shower mat not clean 
 bed was very uncomfortable early check in option would be nice 
 decaffeinated coffee for breakfast 
 nothing 
 poor service from staff would not supply bucket of ice when requested overly aggressive and miserable security guard actually searching people on leaving buffet breakfast 
 the courtyard is lovely though it would have been nice if it had actually been possible to have drinks in the marquees set up there they must be reserved for special events the only criticisms i have of our stay are that the walls are a bit thin so when the other guests came in around 1am on both nights we could clearly hear the closet doors and the sound of conversation also our room had only one bath towel which we only realised after emerging from the shower and there was no bottle opener or corkscrew for the minibar the free bottle of water and the evening chocolates were appreciated but we only had them on the night of our arrival i rather expected that these would be there on the second night as well all minor points 
 staff unhelpful and rude absolute lack of customer care misleading information staff unable to sort out basic simple problems for the money i paid i was expecting at least a 2 star level service 
 often the corridors were dirty with food bed time candy only happened on the first night
 no car park very small bar so it is better to drink eat out in the evening 
 i cannot think of anything i would change in this hotel 
 location but i guess that was my choice
 very small room bad attitude from reception staff 
 no soap or shampoo in room
 we didn t eat breakfast in the hotel as we felt it seemed rather expensive 
 the room was very small for executive standers
 hotel layout was like a maze and a nightmare in a fire lift only to 1st floor room221 was noisy due to a fan above the roof which tripped in regularly all night
 the room the sofa bed 
 scaffolding directly outside window double bed against wall so clambering over partner to get in out 1 towel in bathroom for 2 occupants paper thin walls heard next door all night
 the asian staff at the reservation desk were very rude they are impatient and impolite and do not know the meaning of customer service and care they are not trained to speak professionally and respectfully to guests the experience has been bad and shocking 
 the hotel is a bit shabby needed to be smartened up the lift service is dreadful only two lifts for 600 people bad toilet service for the bar area 
 a little narrow building so hallways are a bit small rooms are fine though mine was lacking a working station but didn t bother me that much 
 in very hot weather the lack of air conditioning might be a problem we had temperatures in the low to mid 20s and that was ok as it was quiet enough outside to leave the windows open at night 
 the room was very small and there was a safe only in the ground floor near the lobby too bad the hotel dosen t supply city maps other then the ones used for specific directions 
 we stayed in room 206 and the noise of staff banging trolleys late at night and early morning was awful in fact the gentleman occupying room 208 threatened not to pay his bill because of the noise when we next book into the hotel we will request rooms well away from the emergency exit where the noise was worse 
 the worst part was that money was stolen from my room the second day of my stay i only exchange a few hundred euros and only those got stolen i didnt put my wallet in the safe and that was the excuse for not recognizing the fact that my money was gone i didnt thought that in a expensive place like this i had to take extreme actions to secure my belongings the main security guy diego was rude and deny the fact that an event like that could happen there but there is always a first time the manager was a little more understanding however they didnt take any responsibility barcelona is city that you can easily get pickpocketed in the metro in the plazas with lots of tourists in fact one morning i woke up and from my room at miramar ive heard lots of commission in the plaza down below some people were running and screaming calling the police the food in the restaurant took more than 40 minutes to arrive and it was only a couple of salads and a plate of nachos 
 nothing here i didn t enjoy
 bar service
 there is no bidet in the bathrooms
 bit noisy at first but you get used to it 
 cannot think of any negative comments
 having to queue for the lift happy comfortable
 double room rather small
 booked a family room for 3 but only a double bed in room fortunately one friend had pulled out late on hilton will not add hhonours points if you book through booking con or any other travel agent apparently 
 nothing it was awesome 
 tea facilities limited
 housekeeping
 rude staff at reception
 very small bed room although i had paid extra to upgrade to a deluxe room with a king size bed this was not as big as the king size at home 
 i would have expected a bottle of water in our room i found that rather disappointing no robes for the pool in our room or at the pool itself
 not much to say here if i would say spmething is that the bathroom was a little small but otger than that all ok
 the staff isn t that welcoming especially those working at the bar the sofa bed isn t comfortable at all 
 for a 4 star hotel all the decoration was pretty old not modern at all the breakfast wasn t included the room was pretty basic there were no toothpaste in the bathroom the customer experience could be better
 the room was very small there was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window for the price we paid i would have expected breakfast to be included 
 the lift was very scruffy
 breakfast 12 are you kidding here in spain 6 and you got a really good breakfast 
 mattress a bit soft
 room lacked bedside tables and no drawers for clothing no bedside reading lights poor service at breakfast long wait for waiter to serve coffee tea and nowhere to serve yourself tray of food left outside next door room all day had to report to reception for removal 
 nothing
 it would be hard going if we were older or infirm as we were on the top floor with steep stairs and no lift but this is a victorian property and we enjoyed the charm and overall feel of the building 
 all very good
 nothing
 very slow bar service could do with net curtains or something other than having to close the curtains for privacy 
 room is a little bit small but ok at this price 
 expensive drinks
 the room we had was very small for 3 of us the only view we had was of a brick wal so there was very little daylight if any at alll having stayed with you on previous occasions i was very disappointed having booked a junior suite i expected better 
 only improvement would be tea coffee making facilities in room
 we were on the 3rd floor and there was no lift which i had not realised on booking 
 very very unhelpful rude staff one lady and a man during the check in two visitors in front of us were treated badly without any respect not very well to us either even though they know that we are british couple next morning whilst waiting for check out they were found to be unhelpful to another visitor who was waiting for breakfast a long time the breakfast was a joke we will never stay there again very expensive to stay even in london standard the worn out room was just enough for the double bed we almost have to dive into the bed 
 the heater didn t work 
 the food too much was produced at the same time which meant that the roast potatoes were cool and hard and the vegetables only warm breakfast was the same lots of food going cool and hard
 old furniture internet very slow the prices a bit high
 air conditioning didnt work and beds were not comfortable 
 price is higher than the value too far if you went for the 1 2 days shopping but perfect foe stay few days 
 the room is too small
 would have preferred tea coffee facilities in room 
 no issues at all 
 my bedroom was a little on the cold side and unfortunately as i don t sleep well anywhere the air conditioning was a bit noisy housekeeping brought me another duvet and i was toastie the second night 
 brakfast no free parking you ll pay 50 per night my room was 127 steps from the elevator room kyes is alawys broke down you need to walk to the reception for activation its realy a long walk 
 expensive breakfast no closets 
 the room was supposed to be a deluxe double room but instead it was a dark tiny room with window view to a wall and limited sunlight it was so small that you could not walk around the bed and my wife had to climb over me to use the bathroom we had payed in advance and by mistake the receptionist charged us again we were cool with the situation as it was a simply mistake however we didn t liked the way the manager spoke to the poor girl we were also told by the receptionist that it was ok if we needed to extent the hour of our check out if needed but we were not allowed in the day after 
 room was a bit too small
 staff could have given better directions for when we walking nearby to find the hotel 
 nothing 
 welcome by staff at the reception a bit unfriendly strange position of the bed in the middle of the room night stand behind the bed toilet separate from the bathroom no sink to was hands in the toilet room had to go from one side of the room to the other to wash hands water bottle on the table costing 5 60 euro but the price tag was towards the wall not visible at first many hotels offer a bottle of water for free with the message with compliments i assumed it was the same and saw the price after i opened it that was an unpleasant surprise wifi not reliable disconnecting and having to login again all the time location was not perfect but it was the closest i could find for the place where i had the event i was attending to i regret not having chosen a hotel in the center and just taking a taxi for getting to the event place there is nothing to see around it feeling cold in the room in spite of putting the air conditioning to a warmer temperature
 breakfast choice quite limited table for 2 persons small i noticed someone put the condiments on floor to make more room
 nothing 
 no lift i was on the second floor it was a long walk up and down several staircases i have mobility issues so it would ve been nice to know this when i booked 
 room was a bit small 
 a kettle tea coffee in the room would of been fab 
 definitely far away from 5 stars poor intercontinental breakfast old furnitures in the room lobby is somehow stylish on a second view cleaness is very poor toilets at the bar elevators tables at breakfast area staff is not very attentive don t get me wrong but a 5 star accomodation is different 
 i loved every moment well done thank you for a wonderful weekend ioannis batsos
 the room needed some maintenance as there were loose fittings in the bathroom and the walls were stained and in need of a refurb 
 the bath taps were faulty so we couldn t have hot water hotter than the safety limit button disappointing for shower and bath reported to front desk 
 nothing
 the water coming from the sink felt waxy or oily i m not sure if that s the type of water in london 
 breakfast was overall good but a bit expensive my bed was ok but my friend s was quite soft not bad if you like it soft 
 the staff member at the reception was going to charge me for breakfast when this was included in the booking if i did not have my email for confirmation she would have charged me 
 i booked originally for 3 nights and then amended the booking receiving confirmation that the property had been notified when i turned up they told me they had no idea what i was talking about the manager undertook to ring me later the following day after i had checked out to let me know about receiving credit for two nights later i never got any phone at all i also emailed the property with the confirmation from booking com and received no reply 
 the food options available under room service were less but then again it is so close to some really amazing cafes and restaurants at bercy that one can quickly step out to grab a meal if they do not want to leave the hotel 
 prices of coca cola horrendous
 the time passed very fast 
 lifts were annoying too many people for number of lifts at busy times
 the restaurant menu was limited was there for a week and ate about same thing each day 
 cost of breakfast
 main observation to report the chairs in the library restaurant were not compatible with the tables there was a difference of appropriate nine inches deficit in the chair seat to the top of the table this was a very unnatural way to sit and enjoy the meal the seating in the breakfast area was perfect although i did point out that the arm of my seat was loose and required some attention the food and ambiance in the library were what i was expecting as i have dined there in the past and another reason i changed hotels for my last night birthday celebration in london hopefully on my next visit to the rubens my feedback to you will have been noted and possibly resolved 
 paying 100 gbp for the room and then having to pay 2 35 gbp for 33ml of water because only hilton honours rooms get bottled water the a c is really really noisy 
 cooked breakfast limited and stone cold two mornings in succession despite raising the matter with management on day one
 all great
 wifi stopped working for 24 hours
 nothing
 the tv channels were really random and the service was a bit hit and miss at breakfast
 air con wasn t great on a really warm night 
 no coffee tea tray in bedroom bedroom carpet was stained in various places
 unable to gain access to roof bar due to private party view from bedroom window staring at a wall
 hotel room wasn t properly cleaned before our arrival we found cookies under the table and hairs on the bed lightning is terrible both in the room and bathroom window curtain was ragged room was not cleaned during our 3days staying not once nor the towels have been changed overall one of the worst hotels i have ever been which is even worse having in mind how expensive it was not recommend at all and i must say i was really surprised with the booking com rating that the hotel has i usually agree with the hotel raiting on web but not this time 
 room cards did not work on arrival and again when we returned for the evening very inconvenient having to walk all the way back to reception twice 
 hotel is huge so don t expect much privacy 
 breakfast expensive for what you receive and the staff was not able to clean the tables rapidly so many of people had to clean the table by themselves or wait for a clean table 
 room had no window and hotel bar jugged hare was uncomfortable and felt unwelcoming 
 all good
 the room is effectively london sized no space whatsoever to put your suitcase and still have a chance to get to your bed or the window or the bathroom where it might not be in the way give the bar staff a chance if they bring the wrong cocktail or coffee or it is not nice tell them they are eager to get it right 
 very hard mattress
 car park is a little low so higher suvs and pick up trucks may struggle with the basement car park
 very small bedroom really small clean and staff very friendly on the plus side 
 location high standard room excellent staff
 noise when the bars and clubs let out the street was full of people and taxis 
 3rd floor room no lift stairs narrow and sloppy not at all advisable to customer with luggage these information should be clear before booking non complimetary whater available we had to ask bathroom noisy every time you open tap or flush water a pump starts with noisy room too small bagage needed to be piled up third bed not ready we asked to prepare it with some disconfort room too narrow garbage bin not empty from previous customer i would not recomed this hotel 
 breakfast room too small
 the elevators are to few and to small for the size of this hotel 
 the breakfast could be more perfect if there are more kinds of foods also the hairdryer couldn t work for a long time and this is very inconvenient 
 small bathroom fire alarm going off twice early morning and fridge was warm
 the size of rooms despite i changed the toom twice the size was never meant to be fir a couple with traveling bags may be for one perso ok
 a bit expensive for the price breakfast should be included
 extremely small rooms and beds
 uninformed about renovations on going to bar and pool area whilst staying unable to access them
 gym can be improved breakfast can be improved 
 there is a very slight odour in room 208 which seems to diminish when the aircon is active slight chaos in the breakfast area 
 a bit far from the center of milan
 full breakfast should be included in the price 
 everything was nice 
 room temperature high 25c airco not working lot of noise outside late in the evening 
 last time i stayed there was a really nice biscuit with tea and coffee in the room it was not there this time no big deal just was looking forward to it 
 the glass door and open shutter in the bathroom couldn t be totally private
 no drop off parking while emptying the luggage for clients arriving by car nor any service to park the car by hotel staff swimmingpool white border line could be cleaner as grease stains rerservation manager not very commercial to our request 
 n a
 we went to the terrace bar and selected an open seat that was upwind due to cigarettes two girls non hotel guests came in and pointed our seat to the waiter he came and told us they were reserved and we had to leave we asked where he pointed to his head and said in here we informed the desk manager who said no seats are reserved a phone discussion followed between him and presumably the bar staff with frequent use of word americanos the desk manager said that if anything preference should be given to hotel guests i asked to speak to the hotel manger and i was informed that the manager was off for the weekend the next morning the staff failed to serve us in the breakfast room instead only serving a different ethnic persuasion it is quite apparent that anti u s sentiment is prevalent we are canadians and did not correct their mislabeling in many countries this conduct would be considered racist at the very least discrimination this behaviour is unacceptable and booking com should remove this location and their corporate partners from their service the hotel also failed to turn on the a c leaving the room at the centrally set rate of 25 c i by passed this control but our travel freinds could not and the hotel took 5 hours to put them in a smaller room there is no excuse for this practice and we do not know if it was the same anti u s discrimination or just plain incompetence 
 having to use the lift despite asking for a low floor as claustrophobic
 the breakfast wasn t that good no egg nothing warm we expected more 
 difficulty with safe and shower head would not sit in fitting 
 kettle hot beverage making facilities in room would have made it perfect 
 the fact the mini bar was not working but the vending machines helped 
 we travelled from australia and spent a total of 13 days at this hotel 6 in the beginning and seven at the end of the holiday we had trouble with house keeping in the first six days room not attended too after being out all day and so no tea to make a cuppa before bed when we went to book out after the first six days i asked the member of staff we dealt with would it be possible to have a river view for the seven days on our return but she curtly replied not on your deal the last seven days three of which had no house keeping at all until my husband spoke to a very nice gentleman on the desk would we stay here again no would we recommend this hotel no when along way from home one needs to be a guest in a hotel that appreciates their patrons 
 hotel is new but they have to change the matrasses soon my back and neck were damaged by the hole in the middle of it also due to central airflow the air is extremely dry and there is no possibility to open window 
 the bath was hard to get into and out of as it was too high and had to ask for non slip mat and fell and slipped the first night and bruised my leg above knee no windows in the room the decor was dated and door of the cupboard for the fridge was hanging off the hinge no daylight in the room was not great 
 the fancoil unit from the room was noisy even if the fan was not functioning in the lobby of the hotel and around the entrance were a lot of strange arab people the whole area seamed to be in a different part of the world not in austria 
 took one hour just to check in as short staffed and busy weekend we booked a cosy room through booking com when we got there staff told us that the cozy rooms are on the first second floor which wasnt clear on the website which defeated the point as we wanted to stay in a room that was higher up and in the main tower with a better view after much discussion they upgraded us to the 11th floor in a twin family room when we specifically requested a double the room was only available at about 4pm so they made us wait an hour they told us each twin was more than queen sized which didnt seem to be the case the family room was connected to another room with a very noisy family
 you have to get to the center or the attraction about 20 30 minute with bus or train
 we had booked a deluxe room but the room we were given was missing the deluxe items the staff brought us the missing items quickly though 
 the price of breakfast 14 95 per person
 took a while to receive our drinks after ordering and sitting down at the bar 
 the bath was rusted and the balcony had a really bad cigarette smell the room not that was smelling naturally clean i did not like the free evening service which is someone entering the room when i am out for diner to switch my television on with classical music closing the curtains and such things without my knowledge that was a little shocker for me 
 upgrade to mercury privilege was a con an extra 80 and we were in a smaller room with the eaves we had to watch that we didn t bang our heads and we are not tall people only provided coffee making machine no kettle for tea and no milk would have expected that automatically provided not needing to request having paid 20 a night extra 
 noisy water pipes 
 rooms are quite small for two people no gym 
 breakfast could have more variety 
 stray pubic hair in the bathroom when we arrived but otherwise very clean 
 to renovate the hotel 
 very dark room felt very enclosed with no view of anything not even a brick wall we had room service and the food was poor and room service did not answer the phone 
 fridge didn t work in the room for the stay and the ice machines weren t working either and since it was 25 degrees
 noisy when you open windows being centrally located 
 have universal adapters for international guests i was not able to use my round charged mac pro due to that fact 
 original room offered was a bit tired and smoky asked to be moved and got a room at the back which was much newer and perfect for us no view but quiet 
 the hotel is very shabby with threadbare carpets the room was small but adequate although the shower controls were a bit stiff 
 the pool wasn t very big warm or cleaned i m not sure if it s in use certain times of the year however this didn t affect our stay at all and hope this doesn t stop anyone from booking 
 the entrance smelt of smoke the reception was unmanned rundown messy and dirty reception staff seemed like they had better things to do than speak to me the walls and windows were rundown and a bit grubby net curtains were grubby bathroom door was grubby house keeping was so poor that the previous guest had left some shoes in the bottom of the wardrobe and house keeping hadn t seen them no ironing facilities or hairdryer in room had to ask for them and this seemed to be an inconvenience to them the outside of the hotel was dirty and rundown bathroom was tiny like 1 5ft by 2 5ft if that if i had been staying more than one night or had been there for anything more than work i d have checked out before i checked in first impressions count for a lot and my first and last were as bad as each other 
 we didn t include breakfast in our booking as the price quoted 17 seemed excessive we enjoyed breakfast at a local cafe on both mornings 
 nothing all fantastic 
 wi fi we had to constantly log in once logged in it was great but if you are not active on your device then you lose connection if you are expecting a message or just want to check email several times then you have to go through the log in process every time very annoying the cost of parking is very high there is a fridge in the room but it is for their mini bar no microwave no desk if you need to work on laptop the bathroom is not 4 quality 
 the external noise due to single glazed windows 
 although we had an executive room it was a bit small particularly the bathroom when we checked out the hotel challenged whether our breakfast was included although i produced the paperwork to prove it eventually the hotel agreed and said they would take this up with you 
 location is far away from subway 
 the minibar put out a lot of light very annoying when you try to sleep
 the bathroom needed redecorating
 nothing i want to come back
 nothing
 more storage room wooden floor in bedroom description of hotel implied that there was a pool bath jacuzzi which there was not
 can t find any fault
 shower 
 everything was great nothing to report as negative 
 nothing 
 the air condition could be more strong as is was pretty warm in the room 
 window don t open and the lights a little bit to low
 suprised that there were no chairs in a superior room that we had to contribute towards parking 
 bedroom quite small 
 was all good
 all good
 the room was not what i was expecting from what i saw on the website when booking 
 tired looking room could definitely do with sprucing up
 the room was not has described or as beautiful
 the breakfast especially the coffee
 costly but it is paris the online deal with booking com was no less expensive than booking directly with the hotel 
 
 none
 location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop the bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep the queue for the check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time the staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in 
 number of pillows we were charged for breakfasts we didn t eat 
 nothing important 
 nothing
 a very small part of the handle cap in the shower fell on my toe would be nice to make sure that everything is safe and sound 
 there wasn t water in the room and each bottle we asked for was pricey the rest was great 
 uncomfortable beds 
 pillows weren t great every time you put your head on them filling went either side which made them almost uncomfortable 
 bathroom was tiny it did the job but you could not move in it 
 lack of entertainment facilities and limited choices breakfast 
 nothing 
 nothing
 hotel was very warm staff in restaurant could have been more pleasant 
 no coffee machine or water in the room staff were rude
 noise pollution especially at night
 it was noisy at night the hotel is in a square and you can hear the noise from the square 
 the fact there was lots of building work going on which limited communal areas the room was dated the staff were rude especially chambermaids the food was extremely poor coffee was terrible 
 reception always busy though staff helpful when you got to them room too hot and noise from street 
 room is very small air conditioning very poor 
 the toilet was not clean
 room was very small very clean though and functional for what we needed
 reception staff could have been friendlier 
 slightly on the pricey side 
 small point but the charging devices by the bed could have been better quality 
 the food is at best old pub like and could be better for this class of hotel and the staff need to correct the faults within the room asap no one repaired the shower the whole of our visit
 nothing
 asked for a quiet room but it wasn t very quiet 
 better soundproofing on the walls and windows as i could hear next door having a shower early hours and the street below a bit too much
 none
 4 star listed hotel but room really needed attention dirty carpet with large stains window with chipped paint room was cold and we had difficulty adjusting the thermostat staff was helpful and brought extra blankets
 have to pay 16 per day for the car park 
 no complimentary water or bath robes in room 
 the rooms were extremely small 2 people and 2 suitcases are enough in order to stop moving inside the cleanness was terrible i had a mouth bleeding problem and they left the pillowcases 3 times in blood because their policy is to change them every 2 days wifi free no way and all those amazing services for only 300 per night
 wifi disaster many calls much wasted time
 very expensive for an average room with smelly drains in the bathroom very long check in and felt unwelcomed and unexpected 
 the rooms were incredibly noisy and extremely cramped ac didn t work properly and the shower head had no support 
 the beds were really uncomfortable and there was no tea coffee making facilities in the room 
 nothing that comes to mind
 nothing to say about what i did not like 
 room which was a suite was tied looking a bit dated also tv channels catered for german guests with only the news channels in english 
 i was given noticed of change of hotel 9 hours before check in very unprofessional by both hilton and booking com both will never get my business again 
 it takes some 10 15 minutes to get to the interesting places and the sidewalks are not always stroller friendly
 very small small thing was when i had freshly filled the kettle the water was discoloured brown when it came out after boiling
 employees should talk another language than english
 its an expensive hotel
 not really a complaint but couldn t get a room window to open 
 room was a bit small 
 spa sauna needs cotton wraps not only towels 
 breakfast could have been hotter and no cutlery on table but overall very nice
 beds are not that comfortable
 we thought the bathrooms could do with updating but still good 
 nothing
 i hadn t realised the room was so tiny ie the size of the bed and little else i had something deducted from my room bill that appeared on my credit card and the staff couldn t tell me what it was for i didn t ask for any breakfasts and had nothing from the mini bar but it still appeared on my bill i wonder how often that happens it was less than 10 pounds so not worth fussing about but very annoying 
 some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby great ormond street hospital disturbing in the nighttime 
 the room had squeaky floorboard was about small and bed not comfy 
 room not available at 3pm in fact not ready for over an hour 
 the air conditioner was broken and it was so hot in the room no one comes to fix it 
 unfortunately during our stay the main lift was out of order and we experienced very noisy residents in a room across the corridor as well as the lift alarm sounding called reception and got a poor response we are working on the alarm nothing done about the noisy residents 
 every thing its ok
 communication of staff great helpers
 lack of english breakfast only continental breakfast espresso and cappuccino with extra costs
 our twin rooms werent available even though i had rang the hotel direct to check and they confirmed we ended up sharing small double beds which wasnt to our liking we were offered a free cancellation hardly great when you have already travelled and we got a free breakfast
 all good 
 a more comfortable and larger double bed
 triple room is a bit cramp for 3 people no tea and coffee making facilities no bottled water supplied
 the spa closed one hour earlier than its should be open so we couldnt really use it 
 service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at 11 15 at night and cost of breakfast 
 cheap toilet paper 
 nothing
 bedrooms far smaller than i would have thought from website or other reviews tiny bed in cramped room bedroom was also very cold had to ask for extra blankets did not think this sized room and bed were value for money
 high price of wine and poor food with added service charge in the lounge
 our room was not cleaned on one occasion
 there was nothing we sought to improve
 room was very very small
 small rooms no closet no table no chair too modern bathroom for my taste should have been shown in photos 
 on the day i checked out i asked the male staff at the front desk to help me book a taxi to the airport he said okay but i would have to pay about 35euro i asked is it for the taxi he said yes therefore i paid in cash i went back to my room to grab my luggage and head down after the staff called my room to inform me that the taxi had arrived he then gave me a sealed envelope containing my paid invoice upon arriving at the airport the taxi driver asked me to pay 60 euro for the taxi fare and i was puzzled i told him that i already paid the front desk and he said no one gave him any money i did not want to argue further so i gave him that amount i called the hotel to explained about what happened and a woman told me that the amount i have paid was actually not meant for the taxi but the outstanding balance i owed the hotel which include breakfast on that day i checked out and a bottle of mineral water the day before i explained that i did not purchase both of them especially because i checked out at 6am in the morning how could i have purchased breakfast the woman then asked me to write an email to them to explain my situation and they would try to refund back the amount to me i wrote and they said they would look into it 4 weeks and 4 emails later and still no response from them i am deeply disappointed at the service at least they could have replied back with some response 
 nothing
 bathroom didn t have much counter space but worked around it
 no bad experiences
 the rooms are small but this is average in paris and the neighbourhood is unpleasant
 small room turtle internet the lobby is okay but the room inside is definitely not belong to 4 star hotel 
 the spa access was limited time limit which is not mentioned in the hotel s information and also not mentioned when realizing the check in 
 everything is poor
 location
 we arrived at 16 00 o clock and our room was not ready yet i complained about that and the receptionist was really irritated and arrogant the room was ready about 30 min later the city centre was about 20min away by tram or taxi 
 bath plug still not working properly although this reported at beginning of 5 day stay basin in bathroom cracked pillows on bed very lumpy only one lift and this rather slow
 no air conditioning or fan in the room during a particularly hot period 
 plates being collected straight after you have finished and the other person hasnt
 none really but not terribly close to a variety of restaurants expecially around 7 30 8pm
 room was quite small and felt cramped
 as a tourist the location was very poor there were no shops or cafes in the area the food in the dining was over priced and poor selection on menu 
 the extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work but in fairness i didn t report it 
 although we were on the 6th floor the unpleasant smell of cigarette smoke from outside the hotel restaurant still filtered through to our room 
 breakfast sweet choice is really poor
 the bed is not firm enough in my view 
 the breakfasts are quite expensive we didn t have any meals there 
 nowhere to sit in reception just a few chairs which were all taken extra seating needed 
 sound isolation with halls you hear people walking like they would walk next to you 
 would have loved some breakfast tea with milk in the tea coffee facilities in the room just provided earl grey with coffee creamer also maybe a decaf coffee pod for the nespresso checkout was very slow maybe should have more than one receptionist on in the mornings 
 first experience entering the room and the pipe of shower was leaking spraying water all over the bathroom when i called reception i got the answer that there is nothing to be done at this point cause is saturday night breakfast very limited and for sure not what i paid according to the advertisement 
 seemed like a 4 that had a 3 standard with a 5 price food was at best average and service was brisk and inattentive most staff were of international origin and it was difficult to communicate at times english felt like the majority of the staff s second language 
 very expensive for value
 lifts were slow 6 for 800 rooms 
 over relying on the intelligent machine sometimes delays the efficiency of checking in and out processes
 nothing
 no 24 hour shop around
 very noisy too expensive considering facilities 
 would rate it as 2 star first room was very small old worn out and dirty next one was ok would have been nice to have a cattle coffee and tea in the room 
 would have preferred a double bed wasn t clearly obvious if there was a bar 
 spaces are small and narrow just like anywhere in amsterdam after the first site we changed our classic room to a luxury one for extra money of course but that was not really luxury either not the one you see on the photo amsterdam is very filthy why don t they put waste bins in the streets 
 check out was a disaster they refunded the deposit to the wrong account and till this day they are trying to charge my credit card for the amount i paid i tried emailing them several times no response very unprofessional 
 rude staff no heat got a alergy from the food been treated like rubbish
 nothing specific 
 room was a bit small but comfortable enough breakfast was a limited to bread and cereals for vegetarians breakfast room would get very busy get there before 7 45am and there was usually only waiter who was really nice and was working very hard 
 in our room toilet was separated from the bathroom it was not even close to bathroom very uncomfortable on the 2nd day we ran out of shampoo and had to go and pick it up because they didn t have anyone to bring it to the room also we ran out of soap on the 4th day they use big bottles of shampoo and soap so probably no one checked if there is enough before we arrived 
 nothing
 bit expensive for drinks food but as expected
 the gym was very poor and shouldn t be classed as a gym also the light outside our room was flashing continually throughout our 2 night stay 
 not much
 the wonderful christmas decorations of 3 years ago still have not made a return 
 we arrived back at the hotel at 11 30pm and the bars were shut sunday night close early that was disappointing 
 nothing only stayed one night and didn t use any other facilities other than the room 
 mini bar is what is missing
 nothing
 the rudeness and unhelpfulness of the reception staff
 restaurant seemed a bit overpriced but we never tried it out so for all we know it could have been outstanding 
 n a
 the booking com driver dropped us at the wrong bilderberg hotel even though we told him it looked nothing like the photo on the website
 lack of business center room size
 the pillows not one was even vaguely firm 
 rooms quite small but only to sleep so fine 
 a little bit small room 
 when we were looking somewhere to book quickly as we were stuck in milan with a flat tyre we looked this up and it looked nice from the photos when we turned up the surroundings were not what we expected as it was tucked away in the middle of no where and not in a good way we checked in with no problems though other guests seemed to have problems this should have been a warning we got to our room and it looked very basic but the first big problem was when i went to the bathroom and i then got stuck with much force i got the door open but i didn t try it again that was when i started to look properly the phone was unplugged and had no numbers or buttons there was no pictures on the walls just holes and screws to where there used to be a picture the menus or any useful information was missing and the door off the shower was falling off never mind the bugs that kept flying in my partner went down to request another room to which they apologised and gave us another room my partner checked the other room and because of the shape of the room it was only half the size when something is wrong with your first room i didn t appreciate a smaller room we went down again and they gave us another room this room now had a window that wouldn t shut and not wanting to repeat the incident of bugs flying in we went down again they then sent someone up to fix that window all whilst this was happening i had to stay in the original room as we had two dogs with us and found it unfair to take them room to room with all of our luggage and this original room no had no electricity as they had deactivated the key and room nothing was compensated and there wasn t really an apology to the fact that we had to change rooms three times all rooms seemed to be different or have something missing so i was extremely disappointed and will be writing a email of complaint to the hotel directly 
 well the toilet was broke
 the price for the room was high i stayed here based on the recommendation of a friend i would probably have chosen to stay elsewhere were it not for their recommendation and the breakfast was typical for the other hotels i used on my trip where the rooms were quite a bit less 
 externally small room 
 nil
 clean and modern hotel but not in an ideal area 
 nothing
 tv was broken and had to be specially started every day
 the room was slightly cosy but ok for the price 
 ac was a bit wild settings would reset every now and then making the room cold during night sometimes
 nothing with the hotel actually there was some huge construction going on next to the train station so the nearby street and area was not so impressive during my stay but in the future i guess this area will become more centralized and lively 
 exclusive rules for children not mentioned prior to booking rules were poorly explained on arrival and led to embarrassing situation at roof top aggressive staff policies on roof top rude service in restaurant family suite was down two flights of stairs a bit tricky with prams and kids more of a night club than a hotel confusion between hotel private members club cars can not stop at the front door making for tricky arrival departure only hotel in 2 1 2 months travel that we didn t feel welcomed because of the kids
 bathroom screen at bath tub could be longer to prevent water from splashing out and wetting the floor 
 the rooms were extremely small i don t think the breakfast was good value for money
 construction work on our floor throughout our stay noisy but finished each day by noon 
 not applicable 
 room was not smoke free so smelt of stale tobacco not sure if you can request no smoking rooms 
 less of safety box
 it s an impersonal corporate pile that s been cobbled together from more than one building and in the older wing beware of the split floors where luggage has to be carried either up or down a flight of stairs 
 the staff wasn t friendly and helpful spicily the houseciping they were not clean up the rooms nice
 english wasn t the first spoken language of the reception staff thus causing confusion in them explaining their policy with regards authorising your bank card for breakables this was not explained correctly at check in by the female member if staff at 10pm when i was tired ready to get to my room but the male member of staff tried to clarify upon check out however i am still unsure as to what amount has actually been authorised from my bank card this probably meaning i won t use this hotel again due to hidden charge amounts
 that they close the bar area after 1am i think it should be available for the customers to enjoy the area all the time as part of the lobby not only for the bar customers 
 bed could have been more comfy 
 a little pricey and because of exchange rates when we arrived it went up slightly from the original price when booked and reserved thought i would be paying instantly online but it didn t take the money so had to pay when we arrived 
 nothing really didn t spend a great deal of time in the hotel 
 breakfast hot food could have been hotter slight smell of smoke in bathroom other than that it was great
 minor bed was hard and took for us some getting used to gym was in principle good but some equipment was in need of repair 
 my only criticism would be that when we ordered room service cheese plate one port and a pot of coffee for two we got an empty plate an empty pot and the coffee made us laugh though 
 as the others have said the entrance to the building is a bit off putting but only downstairs the carpeting in the room could definitely use some renovation and the drainage in the shower was slow the curtains didn t really block out the light in the morning the reception only works quite limited hours 
 rooms are a little dated and basic
 our room was not available when we arrived and had to wait another 45min to 2 45pm could have been acceptable if they hadn t known we were coming in at 2 but we arrived the first time at 11 asking if it was ready and said we d only go out for lunch and then get back at 2 they then offerd us a free drink but no one came to take our order until 5min before our room was ready 
 has to park elsewhere in the area at a different hotel
 even with the discount we thought that the restaurant was overpriced however we found a lovely restaurant nearby 
 the size of the tiny sink in room 368
 room is a bit small just fit two small luggages 
 dinner shift room service are not friendly 
 staff attitude bag lost for an hour and a half unacceptable excuse was they couldn t get through to my room on the phone
 fire alarm on first night however the hotel even offered a complimentary breakfast the next morning to make up for it no complaints 
 no comment
 the maids were very noisy early in the morning woke us up everyday 
 you can t control the room temperature yourself it is monitored the same for everyone and it is a locked control we were hot in our room and would have liked it cooler 
 although hotel has no smoking policy we felt cigarette smoke in our room every day either our room being close to outside smoking area or guests smoking in their rooms 
 staff is not friendly and prices are very greedy on fair times rooms need renovation 
 very little interaction with staff even at breakfast
 the staff were quite snooty and felt they were looking down on us for being a younger couple
 the very late delivery of the room while check in 
 nothing expect more than these give and your not in touch with reality 
 nothing just perfect 
 toilet could have flushed better
 no foreign tv channels not even cnn no lift access to all rooms
 room on street side was noisy construction across the street desk area is cramped 
 shared bathroom
 bathrooms
 possibly more glasses in the room we needed to ask a few times in room or lobby complementary coffee would have made it perfect closer to a metro might have been nice but just a few short blocks walk to madeline 
 bathroom too small if we d been staying longer no lifts 
 room small but very adequate
 lack of wifi available but at a cost no safe in room no complimentary water provided 
 no laundry of ironing
 no kettle in room when i asked if i could order room service on check in they said i had to call down i got to the room then there was no menu food was not great for the cost either 
 rooms too small hardly any space to put your luggage especially if you take a single room
 some rust in the bathroom one day was given pillow cases with dry blood on them didn t bother calling reception as had another pillow were changed the next day
 my only issue is that their wi fi service is so intermittent that i wanted to throw my ipad out the window they need to get a new provider plain and simple but despite this we love staying there and the italian lady who is the hostess in the dining room at breakfast deserves a raise because she always gets your day off on the right foot we love staying here 
 rooms very dated and tired no gym
 single rooms are very very small 
 the bathroom needs grab bars for the elderly and the disabled to steady themselves at the shower because even the shower floor gets slippery also it seems un french to have coffee from a machine and not brewed
 very expencive parking very expencive breakfast location 2 10 for travelling with a baby small room no wifi on the 7th floor 
 warm water supply didn t work house maid came knocked several times in the early morning despite don t disturb sign
 toilet and bathroon separate need to go to next room to wash hands no hd on the tv
 coffee machine in room not working but when i reported it the staff made me a coffee as there was no time to wait to replace a new machine 
 the location of the hotel is not so good the access to the metro needs 10 minutes walking 
 nothing so far 
 restaurant manager was rude and we had cause to complain a discount offered to guests in the restaurant wasnt honoured in addition reception staff attempted to resolve it which was nice but this individual let down the hotel as otherwise the overall experience was excellent and this was our second visit it
 as with many boutique and four star hotels there are some services that are missing we did not have a car at this time so that restriction was not a problem 
 the room i stayed in 301 was a little noisy and the heating was not running efficiently so it was a little chilly but i did not mind since i was staying for only a night 
 the breakfast area was very hectic 
 the room was very stark and the large window made the sun very hot you need a bike if you re staying here as it s quite far to walk anywhere 
 the part of the building i was in seemed colder than the main part of the building which was ok for sleeping but a little chilly for the morning shower
 in our room there was a high threshold between bedroom and bath that took some getting used to otherwise we had everything we needed and no complications 
 nothing
 very small rooms cleanliness prices 
 could improve a lot the menu
 staff not very helpful or friendly a lot of banging from the room above us and staff didn t say anything when we complained about it 
 bathroom was small
 nothing 
 room was tiny 
 no suggestions
 the room could ve been a bit bigger as we had a cot in there always could be cheaper but hey 
 should have stayed longer i will return 
 poor bar atmosphere
 the boiler was broken so the room did not warm up the water was cold and we were told in the morning that we wouldn t have water from 10 00 13 00 the managers were very helpful and compensated me for this
 breakfast no fresh vegetable beds are too sagging lack of air circulation in hallway carpet at the entrance need to be replaced
 room very small particularly the bathroom on first evening paid for breakfast for following morning took quite a while to acknowledge us at breakfast we had found our own seat and helped ourselves to cereal before anyone spoke to us they said we hadn t paid for breakfast and took quite a while to sort the problem out which we found quite embarrassing the breakfast which we were served wasn t what we ordered and my husbands scrambled egg was bad spoke to reception to complain and they apologised and refunded the cost immediately so can t fault them the staff in the dining room just need better management if service and eggs had been ok it would have been a good breakfast with plenty of choice 
 no complaints 
 i can t think of anything that could be improved except for the occasional subdued subway sound we were on the 3rd floor this is absolutely not the hotel s fault we had tea at laduree royale and we heard the subway sounds much more louder than in our hotel everything was exquisite at this hotel any requests for assistance were all accommodated 
 the room was quiet fine but quite small but for the price and considering we were in paris it was just fine 
 there was a smell from the drains in the toilet plug fitting in the sink needed attention but we weren t there that long to complain 
 nothing all perfect
 internet connection not very good television picture was poor 
 there were not connected rooms it was a family trip with my children being under 12 thus was a bit uncomfortable but cleanness service breakfast location compensated us for this i will definitely recommend it to others and i will visit it again 
 the hotel is not in the nice building on the provided fotos but the ugly one on the other side of the street very annoying 
 very small room no car parking very bad breakfast 
 the bed was too hard would prefer more of a variety at breakfast also better care with making sure there are no insects in the room 
 awful noise from subway and fridge noise was loud all night worst night we ve had in any hotel we ve stayed in would not recommend to anyone 
 nothing much 
 they didn t give us the bottle water
 would have preferred a better view from our room 
 our bath was disgusting it had horrible brown orangey stains i wouldn t step in it without having a towel down in the bath there was alot of dust on day of arrival i hated the duck feathered pillows and duvet i would of preferred a mini fridge rather than a mini bar the rooms could do with being updated to match the reception area 
 worn down mold on the bathtub no warm water in the 8th floor after complaining we got a room in 3rd floor with a new bathroom service in the breakfast room terrible on the weekend
 didn t allow a 2 hour late check out
 nothing
 they put two single beds together
 n a
 the breakfast was optional at an additional 10 00 per head the breakfast was extremely dissapointing with only 1 member of staff topping up on food and beverage the bread rolls were rock hard and not edible i had to request on more than 1 occasion for coffee to be topped up very limited vegetarian options for a hot breakfast i even heard 2 other tables complaining about how dissapointing the breakfast was we ended up purchasing breakfast elsewhere after checkout parking is on a first come first serve basis but the hotel should inform people that street parking is for residents only between 1pm 8pm there were a fair few cars with parking tickets that may have been guests from the hotel the front of the hotel caters for up to 10 cars if a huge van doesn t decide to take up more than 1 allocated space the back car park can hold up to 10 cars but is usually occupied by vans 
 need better gym equipment
 when i booked i mentioned that it was my partners 40th birthday and asked if they could make even more special but no effort was made regarding that 
 the neighborhood is quiet and rather residential there are not many shops or restaurants close to the hotel it takes about ten minutes to walk to the next metro station 
 i had to request hangers when i arrived as they were missing the shaving mirror was missing there was a lot of rust on the towel heater the lock on my window was broken when the wind blew it would open letting cold air came in during the night the heater didn t work in the bedroom so i slept with two blankets basically the rooms are very tired looking and need a refurbishment 
 under renovation 
 choice of breakfast you could hear neighbours inside the hotel
 i complained about a smell in our room 419 nothing was done about this we tried turning off aircon to alleviate this didn t work just left room stuffy 
 the facility needs an upgrade rooms tired and dated also rooms small but that is true for many small paris hotels 
 staff were not particularly helpful
 only trouble our room was hot and there was no way to regulate the temperature except by opening the windows which for security reasons we closed at night 
 some of the staff were very impersonal and not very helpful breakfast was very overpriced for what was offered 
 no bath only a shower but that wasn t even too much of a hindrance 
 bit small
 breakfast a bit expensive for what you get 
 nothing 
 one small observation room 311 the bathroom lay out left a lot to be desired with the toilet right behind the door so the door would not open fully smaller sink and toilet next to it a better idea this did not detract from the fact the hotel in general was brilliant this is only our personnel thoughts 
 all good
 the bar area was small and it felt like sitting in the foyer if you were to have a drink i did not see the bar being used at any time during my stay
 the rest of the staff are 90 east europeans so the come with their own attitude so there wasn t much in the way of a traditional london welcome breakfast tables are not wiped down properly so there is crumbs everywhere bedroom wasn t cleaned properly on arrival and still had some past guest rubbish 
 the rooms are not cleaned and the carpet of the whole floor needs to be changed 
 no slipper toilet paper very bad
 i found my room was very poorly distributed in terms of space it becomes very uncomfortable a door impossible to open and which closes automatically behind you divides the bedroom from the entrance and bathroom toilet area you have to cope with that door several times a day bathroom and toilet are very oppressive breakfast is 18 and certainly not worth it apart from these two points i d say this is a nice hotel 
 water pressure a bit dated 
 nada 
 they must have a attractive bar at least for a drink
 the internet issue kept dropping every 10 minutes and the keyboard in business center it took 1 hour to do 15 minutes work 
 bed in centre of room not against a side wall
 breakfast service long queues for entry to dining room second day taken through hotel to another dinning room which was in fact a small bar area and very cramped
 funny thing about the bed the duvet seemed too big for the bed and kept slipping down over the end of the bed this is a really picky observation 
 the room service was terrible i ordered a hugely overpriced tuna toasted sandwich and which was dry and almost inedible and a bowl of chips which were undercooked but i was starving after a long day and had already waited 40 minutes for it to be delivered would have been better off visiting one of the great turkish restaurants nearby 
 poor choice of bar food mine came up cold 
 absolutely fabulous
 nothing its a great place to stay car parking is very pricy though at the outside car park 55 pounds for over night but very safe take the train instead 
 we didn t know we should pay the full amount of our stay plus insurance on arrival you receive your insurance back at the end of your stay there are computers with printers available on the ground floor however the printers were out of ink we also had some problems with the microwave you will find certain instructions to prepare it for usage when using it for the first time also the lights in the room are all turned on or off at the same time except for a small lamp so it s either too dark or too bright in the seating area in addition the wifi could ve been better 
 a little unsatisfactory breakfast 
 the wall of rooms is not sound prevented i can hear the sound of television and speaking of neighbors loud and clear it is very annoying when this happened in the evening 
 the rooms are very average
 elevators to old little far from metro
 there was no step on the shower cabinet door so water always came to the bathroom floor had to put down towels and wipe the floor after showering toilet flushed lazily breakfast was on the expensive side television had some zoom mode on which was unable to change or the device itself was of poor quality 
 nothing to dislike
 poor tv channels outdated shower bath combo poor ventilation in room hotel needs makeover decor is old 
 nothing
 breakfast should be added into price 
 smell of smoke along the corridor in floor 3 no scrambled eggs for breakfast on day 2 
 breakfast i personally felt should of been more choice of cereals
 everything was perfect
 needs to be clearer that parking should be booked and is very limited wifi was a bit temperamental lovely stay though i d definitely go again 
 rooms dark in the badem ntel very continued space
 we were half board but we had to pay for drinks even just a bottle of water one glass of wine was 10 euros very expensive for the services offered in my opinion 
 roomservice was a bit late and did not change sheets one day 
 not much of a bar and we were unable to get a drink when required we could only get served if we took it to our room and it was only 10pm 
 a few more seats in the lobby lounge would have been helpful but not really a problem 
 there was nothing that we didn t like in this hotel 
 room was very small no bath breakfast wasn t nice was cold 
 the food was a little too expensive but nothing beyond the paris average 
 room very small bed sheet never change have to ask to change 
 very very loud could hear every coming and going staff were not particularly welcoming and were in a hurry to get me out of there calling twice before 4pm even when i had paid for a late check out til 4pm 
 i had no bad experience
 noisy air conditioning unit but they did discount the room rate on check out
 the lift had a mind of its own and every time took me on a floor by floor tour which was quite annoying
 only suggestion maybe put shelves on the wardrobe 
 payed 60 deposit for two night stay and still haven t received my deposit back been calling every single week and don t get anywhere with em a big con never again 
 ther single rooms are too small 
 cold water in pool and jacuzzi
 the executive room should prepare tea making pot in the first place however the room service staff did bring us the set after we asked for it 
 mattress bed was not very comfortable view into centre courtyard was quite ugly drain pipes heat ac units but could have been improved with a higher rate room although we did have a nice room 
 nothing everything was very pleasant 
 the rude staff
 the problem is my bed did dip in the middle that is the only problem i found
 the menu in the restaurant was a little limited and the breakfast was so expensive however we just went into the city centre for food so it wasn t too much of a big deal 
 this was supposed to be a 4 hotel the facilities were not great the room was not very clean the carpet was dirty and there was foam sticking out of the walls 
 spilt drinks in the bar
 poor room fittings and condition
 view from rooms
 the saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual the air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside the bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person i really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep 
 the only thing i would say i didn t like was the swimming pool was cold the location was good but i think for a young couple i would have liked to have stayed the other side of the thames
 no english subtitles available on the films
 nothing 
 room design is creepy not for everyone staff wasn t very kind and helpful had bad temper
 no local air condition in the room at least we didn t have any so in case hot weather might be uncomfortable 
 nothing
 the check out could have been a bit later would have mad me happy
 very expensive
 breakfast not included in rate business center closed on weekends
 um the wallpaper 
 cleanliness did not reflect the 4 star rating room did not appear the same as advertised on the booking com site expected older style furniture fittings for a period hotel
 wifi signal could be better but this is hardly a complaint maybe providing free parking would be nice and the breakfast although decent and convenient was expensive even with the discount we got it was on par with my friend s hotel breakfast in terms of price so i m sure other hotels all have similar prices 
 check in is very slow
 most of the rest not very clean unannounced absence of breakfast without extra time for checkout at 11h innacurate bill they claimed 20 euros more without justification the hotel is clearly unfinished and messed up 
 this hotel is 3 stars maximum and expected much more form a 5 starts hotel rooms are very very small unless you want a basement room with a small window and extra humidity very poor lighting in the bathrooms and good luck if one wants to shave or put makeups most photos you see on the web such as google are from the montcalm hotel across the street watch for the mice 
 room was not nice in the tower part 
 nothing
 room cold and not serviced regularly
 gong bar always too busy 
 over charged for the room informed staff in which they stated i had not few days later money was returned back into my account 
 shower mixer did not work properly and the water went from hot to cold abruptly the problem could not be fixed for some unkown reason 
 stayed on first floor and there was a smell of sewers all down the corridoors we went for breakfast in the hotel and after waiting 40 minutes left with none we stayed in room 123 for 2 nights and each night received 4 calls in the early hours from other hotel guests trying to order room service which kept waking my baby up 
 some staffs at the breakfast place were not friendly 
 we didnt take breakfast there as it was 19 99 gbp per person and close to hotel are cafetieres or restaurant serving full english breakfest cheaper 
 nothing everything was wonderful
 1 costly for small room 2 i did not like that when we arrived and during check in i paid for the breakfast for the two nights in the morning i was sick and did not go for the breakfast my husband went alone but he informed the staff that i am sick and can t eat breakfast and requested for yoghurt and tea to the room when we were checking out i found that they have charged the breakfast for two persons and also the room service we explained to them and tried to request them to consider either one even if they charge the breakfast which was expensive but they said breakfast is nonrefundable and they claimed that they only charged the delivery for the room service again don t know why it is not a big deal for this small case but they could manage it better so we an appraise and give good comment about the hotel 
 the breakfast is a little bit expensive
 i pay 60 pounds for changing a high floor room it is soexpensive 
 reception at this hotel checked me in to the hotel room n the afternoon at 10 30 pm they checked in further quests into the same room total strangers walked in to my guest room when i was undressed very poor attitude of management and terrible security and in my case total disregard to my privacy total strangers being given access by reception to my room late at night is reckless and dangerous 
 very small room underground passes every minute from early morning to past midnight above surface and just below the hotel not clean smelly very old and badly maintained black spots and humidity in the bathroom it must have been quite a good hotel long time ago needs much refurbishment and maintenance 
 no hook on back of bathroom door to hang robes or toiletry bags no shelf by mirror for combs and clips whilst drying hair
 wifi and breakfast not included
 we found the pillows to soft and could have done with more of them
 nothing its was all great and made my wife s 70 birthday complete i am younger just for the record 
 well the bathrobe was 2 but they never returned the 2nd one so i didn t have one to use after 1st day
 i requested a toothpaste from the receptionist i did t get it 
 we were charged 8 euros day for the parking 
 quality of food has significantly dropped i hope only due to some singular incident 
 too small
 service teething issues slow some rude staff didn t really understand the system fully most very lovely and polite but just not slick enough given the prices 
 single rooms are to small and very old furniture comparing with price 
 breakfast is basic although the food is quite good 
 noisy rooms facing main road no aircon windows had to be opened and noise went on till about midnight
 the room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel we had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty the window was also small due to the location of the room within the building 
 bathroom could be more comfortable
 at check out i was charged 20 euro s for breakfast however a guest checking out before me had the same room charge but breakfast included on my question to the front desk clerck on how this was possible i got the reply that the other guest booked directly through their website breakfast included and i had booked through booking com and therefore had to pay extra for breakfast maybe something to look into by the booking organisation 
 the price is high
 the price of breakfast so we just had our breakfast in the organic cafee 
 every day same beak fast location
 rooms very compact
 not very much
 it may have been just our room but i would definitely add another wardrobe or chest of drawers we only spend two nights but someone with more clothes would probably have to leave them in the suitcases 
 the room was very very cold the heating wouldn t work no extra pillows i might as well slept on a irioning blared very uncomfortable pillows duvet was so thin i had to sleep with socks jumper today i actually feel so ill sleeping like that the charger plug socket wouldn t work properly couldn t even charge my phone next to me had to getting up in the night to charge it as i came in to check in the girl asked my name then says sorry nothing under your name needed some sort of proof of booking what like i was lying that s how it felt went into my emails found the booking ref then realised she made a error how to spell my surname when i actually spent it out for her lal is that really hard to spell i dnt want to made to fell like i wasn t good enough for your hotel don t no what image i had on people 
 lifts didn t work air conditioning didn t work and rooms very small
 parts of the hotel were being renovated so some noise during the day presumably that will be over within a few weeks or so 
 nothing
 noisy room machinery in the room light command very confusind and at first not working 
 the date we checked in the two staff was rude and upon asking for room on the spot they said they are all booked where as i got it booked on booking com in just 5min rite after they said no the rest of the staff was good but those those two specially need to get some lessons of hotel management and needs to know how to treat a guest the two people were a lady name i don t remember and man whose name starts with m
 facilities in room to be able to wake up and make a cup of tea
 poor and pricey breakfast
 1 the shower the shower cubicle is in the middle of the room boxed by glass panels with one side completely and i mean completely transparent the other sides have frosted strips but there s absolutely no chance of modesty if you re sharing the room great for couples not so for everyone else if the hotel management is reading this could i suggest one way mirror film for the glass panels at least for some of the rooms 
 it could have been better if there were more facilities in the hotel such as a swimming pool 
 the smell of cigarett was annoyant may be that is bettet to ban the people of smoking in the rooms 
 more tea and milk in the rooms
 making reservation for the hotel via booking com was a complete mess we ended up paying extra 30 on arrival on top of already paid price booking com staff very unhelpful disorganised and inexperienced in dealing with issues on guests arrivals 
 very noisy and extremely small bathroom
 nothing
 rooms were tired and worn
 the room was a bit tight but it fit all 5 of us 2 adults 3 kids they had a really neat bunk bed that the kids loved and the beds were actually really comfortable we were able to open the window for a nice breeze and fresh air and the location it isn t super busy for traffic so the noise level was not a bother and we all had great sleeps 
 bed was hard room was 24 5 uncomfortable sleep hard bed front of house noisy till 2am should have automatic front doors like the side entrance as staff find it hard to open a door for you 
 gym is poorly equipped 
 rooms very small
 just found the room a little small 
 the website states that no reservation of parking lots is necessary when we arrived all parkings were taken and we have to find an expensive parking abroad 
 nothing we could point at except the bathroom sliding door that didn t work properly 
 needed updating but that s happening now 
 the room was a little small but come on look where you are you don t go to london and stay in your room 
 staff at reception seemed to lack training very slow i had prepaid for my accommodation and did not take anything from the bar fridge yet they had charged me for a drink i did not take i had to request they amend the account i also needed a sewing kit none in room had to request one be sent to the room went downstairs for breakfast and as we didn t want the buffet had to sit in the open area to eat not good on the second morning at about 4 40am everyone was told over the pa system to evacuate the hotel there we were standing out in the street in the drizzle with absolutely no instruction from any hotel staff as to where to stand or what was going on we had to ask the firefighters what was happening 
 rooms small even by london standards
 on arrival at paddington hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel the hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis we received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for london we did not receive it 
 the walk to the hotel was a bit uncomfortable i would suggest you advise in advance to use the metro with the numbers etc make it easy for a 1st time to paris traveller 
 stuff are so so rude room is very small toilet smells so bad 
 had to wear swim hat to spa
 view but that is just nit picking really
 breakfast overpriced at 15 euros
 romantic level of the room wifi very slow 
 staff were not very welcoming or helpful rooms are really really small dirty bathroom 
 n a
 parking around there was expensive
 the lobby bar area as you enter the hotel is a little rowdy during the evening but unnoticeable once you re in the lift on your way up to your room or when you re in your room just wish it was the reception desk as you walk in as opposed to a bar 
 although the bedrooms were decorated ok the furnishings were in need of refurbishment 
 nothing all good
 no room service
 one person on the reception may keep you waiting for quite sometime serving other clients beds are very small i think we got 130 cm as a double bed that was very uncomfortable 
 the breakfast s fruits
 small room 
 in the morning when i was supposed to arrive at the hotel i saw a payment on my card s statement toward the hotel for the whole amount of the 2 rooms i booked around 900 euros and not informed about that at the booking s moment once arrived they explained me that they had just freezed the money and that i would have been able to see them in 3 to 5 days and i therefor decided to pay with a different card now what is scandalous is that after 6 working days i still don t see the considerable amount on my card and calling the hotel i just got always the same answer you have to wait few more days well guess what this hotel got in one day 1800 euros for two rooms and i am still waiting to get back my 900 this can t and must not happen 
 becoming pretty dated
 room especially bathroom is tiny and a little dated
 nothing to comment
 spa and pool is tired and needs a refit without a car it may feel a little remote but is only a 10min drive to pretty much everywhere 
 poor room by the elevator noisy shower stayed there one night and asked for a different room for the rest of our stay 
 service at breakfast breakfast was cold 
 no early check in after long overnight flight with kids and no late check out luggage storage available 
 no room facilities in the room for tea and coffee 
 there was a soaked carpet in one room the next room they gave me had a toilet that didn t flush and an area in the room that smelled of urine the elevator jerked badly every time it stopped on the lobby or the floors above 
 you have to walk through the smoking bar to get to the non smoking bar 
 heating was not working 
 there s no big lobay
 though booking made through your agency and payment was taken in advance of our arrival the hotel made an unusual step of demanding a further guarantee of 100 to cover any other services such as breakfast we declined breakfast as it was quite expensive at 17 per person 
 don t know
 cost was high but you get what you pay for in the middle of london 
 the breakfast was poor to go to the room i had to climb up some narrow stairs with the luggage not convenient the water shower was very weak and not hot enough 
 no tea coffee making facilities in the room 
 room was quite cold needed the blanket from the cupboard but it was rough and one to share with twin beds was a little awkward breakfast was of a fairly poor quality and the lifts weren t all working and with a full hotel it became very difficult to get the lift at peak times so we used the back stairs half the time which was really frustrating as the staff didn t seem to know where to point us to go when asked chambermaids hotel needs usable stairs for when lifts aren t available 
 room a little small but was very well laid out and still had everything you would need 
 fewer stairs but not a problem
 nothing
 the sauna that was a main reason for us to book this hotel is not getting hotter than 70 so just able to warm up also no place for resting after turkish bath is good rooms smaller than it seems on the fotos same for bath rooms carpet specially in the area close to the room door not very clean
 some noise from street major building work in that area 
 the first room allocated to us was in the basement which had no corded phone and mobile service felt like an isolated basement bunker we eventually requested for a room swap which took some trouble because we had to go to the reception no corded phone meant we weren t able to dial from our room to reception had to pay for in room wifi but was not much of an issue because i had mobile data 
 very misleading description only have twin beds with two single duvets no double beds with proper duvets not ideal for a romantic break don t go here
 bed was a bit hard
 very loud room windows right at the street side no parking even for 2 min to leave pack luggage the rest was very good 
 nothing whatsoever it was simply amazing 
 everything it is different from what you see when booking
 very small room 
 locatin no water in the room
 there s no spa that would have topped it off a massage steam room and pool jacuzzi 
 poor breakfasts 
 being charged for wifi
 the parking exit wasn t working and the cost of the parking 
 nothing
 i have no complaints 
 room rather small but ok for short break pity there was an extra charge to use the pool 
 this is quite an expensive hotel but then again this is central london 
 room could have used more lights and in general the hotel could use a slight refurbish 
 tiny room do not swing cat there 
 the floor in the bathroom could do with a good scrub probably not so easy with marble but there were quite a few noticeable drops 
 the umidity and heavy crowed in barcelona
 bed was very soft and uncomfortable could here a lot of noise from outside at night room a lot more basic than anticipated 
 restaurant and buffet were not the best to put it nicely definitely eat the food at the bar we chose this hotel because of it s non smoking rooms when i booked i even added a special note making sure these were non smoking rooms we booked 4 rooms with this special request when we got there 3 of our rooms were great and 1 smelt horribly of smoke we addressed this with the front desk they sent someone up to smell and she told us it did not smell of smoke and it was a matter of opinion we asked several times to switch rooms or for a discounted rate as we would not be using the room and instead sleeping on the floor of one of our other rooms we had booked but they were extremely rude and not accommodating at all she continued to say it s a matter of opinion in fact she mentioned she smokes and so she would know how it smells lol what a joke after several workers came to smell and a pretty heated argument they finally switched us to another room my question is why didn t they switch at the first complaint we are all still baffled at that the customer is always right but to them their opinion and sense of smell was greater than ours night crew was very condescending and rude 
 no kettle in room
 nothing
 the room was quite small
 hotel price of breakfast
 every where in paris the price is every time too much 
 room and bathroom were very small for two people 
 staff didn t always understand needs since english was a second language housekeeping didn t give enough wash clothes or replace notepad 
 bathroom really grubby uncomfortably so shower curtain was changed when asked but nothing more and it shouldn t have been in that state in the first place 
 aircon system not the best
 little rooms bad breakfast no parking too little bed
 slow wifi
 room cleaniness and hotel policy regarding non smoking policy being disobeyed by others guests 
 just felt the rooms could be a little less sterile some artwork on walls or a splash of colour would be good 
 lobby was lacking in comfortable seating 
 the room was not completely made up on arrival no soaps shampoo etc dining is in a caf which exactly that a caf breakfast was average buffet was dry staff were inattentive one couple sitting next to us asked for some water the answer they got was it s over there pointing to the buffet room they asked again and eventually the person got two glasses of tap water from the kitchen and dropped it down in front of them no there you are or any other acceptable comment from the staff member the two people got up and left the man was using a walking stick 
 house keeping average
 nothing
 bed room area was small but i was happy the bathroom was nice size 
 not so good cold water after 10 h pm the shower out 
 room size
 slightly small sized room 
 i paid a lot for one night and when i arrived at the hotel they charged me even more 
 service charge being added to bar bill when no service was received very little hanging wardrobe space no robes provided in room
 somewhere to do my hair
 n a
 no windows soap dispenser squirted at 90degree angle plug sockets so close to tabletops that it s a battle to plug appliances in both trivial but worth noting to assist future users we would stay again 
 can t think of anything to improve 
 although there was a tram stop right outside the hotel we had hoped to be closer to the city centre and attractions 
 very nosily the worst wifi housekeeping open my room when i sleep
 bath was tiny and didn t drain properly and bed was two singles pushed together
 soft uncomfortable beds room a little cramped 
 very small rooms everything costs extra wifi is gbp 10 or day and pool is 8 pounds extra 
 poor free wifi you need to pay in order get better speed 
 the reception desk asked for my date of birth 
 nothing
 2 aspects door of the bathroom is designed from glass and do not close properly the taxi asked for 2 30 pm arrived at 3 pm
 room very small
 we upgraded on arrival our room was still quite a standard room we didn t have a bath which we kind of expected and the room was cold 
 very noisy room expensive for what you get little poor toilettries cardboard cups for tea coffee disgraceful dirty carpets
 staff was not cordial not good hospitality
 there was a scaffold on the building so safety was a concern it was dusty out there no rebate was offered in any form entrance to the room pretty narrow 
 didn t like that there was works going on while are stay there and the rooms weren t anything special consider your paying good money could have stopped in a ibis for a lot less but same comfort
 noise from function suite after 10pm disturbed us we liked everything else 
 nothing i did not like 
 getting out of the car park very little signs and the very few there are were poor and misleading
 not enough products in the bathroom the floor has not been cleaned booked a double bed got two separated and they did not changed it the swimming pool is too small it is not 5 star hotel too overrated
 rooms overlook the internal lobby and can be a bit noisy
 the location is tricky to reach by car
 thin walls so i could easily hear the neighbour shower 
 breakfast too expensive
 staff not always friendly or helpful i just assumed it was the austrian way 
 raised with staff at the time otherwise excellent electrical supplies and sockets at the desk workstation will not accept oversize plugs 
 we did not stay long enough 
 really big problems with wifi signal and overall speed 1 2 4 mbps 
 nothing
 nothing
 the lighting could have been stronger in both the room and the dining room 
 very noisy trains and planes the staff were extremely noisy talking and laughing outside our window at 4am one night and in the early morning 
 9 95 for 24 hours is ridiculous i ve been to wooden beer shacks on koh samui thailand where it s been free it s ripping off foreign tourists that want to keep in touch with home 
 udaljenost od centra
 
 very tight space specially the shower
 no air con minimal breakfast
 the hotel charged more than 100 eur from my creditcard 1 month before stay the whole amount was 350 eur it was booked for my daughters so my creditcard was not there they need to pay cash the whole amount of 350 eur and i still did not get my money 100 eur back 
 the room service breakfast which should be a highlight was unremarkable 
 the heat was not working properly so it was rather cold in the room during the night 
 bathroom a bit tired but perfectly functional 
 would have liked omlete added to the menu made to order 
 nothing 
 four star hotel but at the bottom of the scale it s all a bit tired carpets not vacuumed in the room communal areas dreary and staff had very poor communication skills 7 70 for two small bottles of water purchased at the bar i felt i was in a hotel in saudi arabia or riyadh would i stay here again no one young lady on reception was very good but that apart this hotel is not up to scratch 
 the single room is very definitely a single room i was fine with that but others may not expect that 
 there was a lot of light coming through the doorway from the hotel corridor 
 fridge in room very noisy breakfast in cotes brasserie was very disappointing and one had to be sent back and then came out cold waitress couldn t have been more helpful though 
 can t fault our room on this visit everything was fantastic 
 wi fi did not connect 
 staff at the front desk were very rude everytime we asked something they looked at us as though we didn t belong there balcony was very dirty not representative of the pictures online room was much smaller than expected 
 swimming pool is very small 
 the room was small and pokey the receptionist that checked me in was very dismissive when i brought my concerns about the room size to her attention
 nothing
 rooms are small but that s to be expected in london
 restaurant service
 hotel overall is quite dark and view from room windows wasn t great once blinds were opened 
 not enough staff to handle the amount of clients always had to wait in a long line for any matter check in concierge check out etc booked a deluxe room which was very much a normal double room and therefore very expensive for what the room was 
 the cost
 hot drinks machine dispenser in communal areas was broken so had to stay in room to make free coffee 
 nothing 
 choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem 
 n a
 i booked a suites room and a double room we asked to be connected because we have 3 children of which one disabled of course we did not have rooms connected or the possibility to changing them at the reception they blamed the booking although i asked them in writing because i could not leave children alone i slept with the children in the suite and the husband alone the couch is terrible it s impossible to sleep on it you can not ask for a lot of money on a suite and offer a very incomfortable sleeping couch by far the biggest disappointment was the breakfast which even though it was free was not good for hotel claims and the parking there was no parking for the wheelchair and in the garage the car did not fit because the maximum was 2 m at a hotel with such claims and prices i expect something else 
 tea coffee making facilities in room
 all good
 breakfast is too expensive
 there should be a plug near the bed to charge the phone
 room wasn t cleaned on one day had to request cleaning at 4 pm
 no dislikes 
 main table always had dirty grime marks on side which never really got cleaned properly would ve preferred for fridge to be easily opened but accept it was stocked for business customers as opposed to tourists 
 complimentary coffee
 u have to change the lifts to exit the property lifts buttons didnt work immediatly we had to push it many times 
 there was no water in the complimentry tray with tea and coffee there is no fridge carpet are old and smelly wifi not available in rooms no free parking 
 i booked a double room for 2 person but when i reached on that day they gave us 2 single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room 
 this hotel is not a four star hotel it may have a leather sofa and minibar in the room but it does not have reception anyone who speaks english or german properly lift air conditioning restaurant or bar they will charge you 10 euro parking but you will park on the street public area the whole staff consist of one russian lady who is in charge of everything she speaks poor english and poor german and is extremely impolite 
 frigobar not available in my room
 the noise form the gun club next door 
 very loud talking in lobby at night while we were trying to sleep after a long journey however when we called the front desk it was taken care of immediately and we were able to sleep 
 staffs are not very friendly
 wifi connection was not brilliant
 staff knowledge of suitable parking would have been a help and warning of the major roadworks outside that started early sunday morning 
 the food menu for room service is very limited not very appetising also being on the top floor our room got very hot had to have the windows open for ventilation as air con wasn t very powerful 
 the underground level room
 expensive bar but it s london 
 the breakfast was too expensive we therefore ate elsewhere 
 the breakfast was poor and so the breakfast area the bathroom was not clean there was always shaved hair at the counter on all 4 days that we were there very old furniture and bed pillows and covers
 nothing
 nothing
 wasn t easy to find the carpark
 nothing whatsoever 
 i got bitten numerous times 23 in total by miggies or something through the 2 x nights whilst i was sleeping 
 breakfast was a tad manic and the coffee was rubish 
 i think for a four star hotel the towels should be clean the bathroom should be free of pubes and other hairs and a new toilet paper placed in the bathroom i would not stay here again and if someone i knew was staying here to proceed with caution 
 key cards not always working
 i had a grilled rump steak and asked for it to be cooked medium to well done which means no blood running in the steak at all but not well done it came as a medium rare steak with the blood still running inside when cooked i didnt return it as i find when this is recooked it will only toughen up the meat so made due as it was also the rest of the meal was covered in pepper as the chips had a coating on them and the large mushroom with a half tomatoe on top had pepper put between them all i could taste was the pepper and not the food it should be a customer choice if they want pepper on there food i have worked as a butcher and chef most of my life and have a good understanding of cooking and uncooked produce i didnt complain as it is not in my nature to make a fuss apart from that it is a excellent hotel with frindly staff and worth a visit and has hyde park on its doorstep 
 that was the smallest room i ve ever seen the room was literally full of one big double bed the remaining space was about 1 5 sq m 
 it s a little far from the centre but you get a lot to compensate 
 needed more tea and coffee sachets in room but staff replaced really promptly when requested
 windows cant be opened if you want to open the windows this can be make by on your own risk 
 we weren t informed that there would be an additional tourist tax until the moment we were going to pay and they charged us twice on the credit card and made it a really difficult process to get the money back that they owed overall the stay was pretty comfortable but the consequences of their mistakes make us never want to go back there again we requested a king bed but got two separate beds at first had to ask them to change after the first night bathroom lock was faulty though their pastry selection was quite good breakfast buffet turned out to be disappointing esp as vegetarians as the meat and vegetables were presented in the same containers 
 ridiculously small room not good value for money with an outside courtyard view of pipework and fire escape stairs no expected bath and the worst designed shower room we ve ever seen strange pillows no obvious english staff why is this 
 the main pool area can be very busy and noisy with a lot of posing hotel guests and the constant smell of the restaurants below fried fish 
 undergoing renovations on the property while we were there but still enjoyed our stay 
 poor service at breakfast every morning
 nothing
 small lift elevator english breakfast with additional 4p
 the beds were two singles pushed together and were really uncomfortable and the pillows were not pillows they were cushions male cleaner was pretty useless and rushed the room left behind rubbish and used cups 
 not really in relation to crowne plaza hotel initially thought the o2 arena was within a walkable distance but were informed by receptionist that it wasn t however silver lining was we got to ride the emirates air line cable car to the o2 arena instead which was a bonus there s wasn t really anything that we disliked about our stay 
 no electric kettle no tea or coffee in the hotel room
 it was a very uncomfortable bed i had backache both nights from the bed and struggled to get a good nights sleep
 heating in the rooms was poor
 room very warm but could not have the window open because of the traffic noice most of the night
 nothing
 very small bathroom and hard to understand how the bidet is still not part of the standard facilities of a 5 stars hotel 
 hotel is dated and needs a refresh no tea coffee making facilities bed was rather uncomfortable and placed one side against a wall not the easiest of hotels to get to from the station unless you go by taxi 
 rooms vary a lot in condition breakfast chaotic on this occasion and staff very rude 
 bed is very small and too soft windows needs to be fixed in order to close properly 
 its hard to say if i was to quibble maybe more menu choice 
 the bed throw had stains on and the hair dryer socket did not work the general decor of the room and bathroom is dated for the price charged 
 my complimentary teas and coffee was not replenish and i had to ask throughout my stay 
 n a
 very small rooms 
 the bed was right against the wall and really not suitable for 2 people the shower was small you could hardly turn around 
 the design of the room is very cool but impractical there is a huge sharp edged pillar nearly in front of the entrance door and the toilet so if you re not attentive you can easily hurt yourself the two seperate sinks are a nice idea but the size is horrible there is no way you can use it without spilling water everywhere it s too tiny 
 rooms are small but typical for paris they were very well appointed however 
 everything was great
 n a
 the car park had been closed for building work meaning that we had no where to park the car i was not informed of this prior to our stay and this was one of the main reasons why we booked this hotel the receptionist brushed it off like it was nothing and told us to park in an ncp car park costing us 10 extra in parking fees was not happy with this service at all
 nothing
 no sooner did i get in our room i could tell it was musty smell the chairs were dirty tired bathroom was really small no shower only over bath pubic hair was on the toilet roll the tv was so small facing no where near the bed i just couldn t stay here went straight ditto reception asked for my cash refund which i payed no more than ten minutes ago they would not refund me they gave me a different room with a walk in shower better bed was horrible we both woke up with stiff backs but the staff put us right off never go there again will tell my friends not to when they do awful 
 location far from activities bad view
 parts of window trim missing small mini bar door slams loud 
 i liked everything
 nothing 
 there was no small fridge in the room breakfast buffet was rather limited 
 room bathroom needs renovation drunk people at the door one elevator broken living room was like a mosque constant prayers may the hotel supply a room for this 
 it has a marvelous rain shower that overflowed the shower pan when we used it the first time we just didn t use the rain head again as there was a handheld available 
 breakfast selection could have been more varied suggest making robes available given the cost of the rooms suggest bottled water given cost of the rooms
 the breakfast isn t worth 18 but there is a small restaurants to the left of the hotel which is amazing 
 nothing 
 the bloody lifts 
 the size of the room 
 very small room strange checkin reception is in a 4th floor 
 very small room price is very expensive 
 the decoration in the room was really of bad taste in general for a 4star hotel the place was neglected the signs showing the numbers of the rooms where printed on papers and some dropped on the floor for days no fridge in the rooms or shower robes the free internet was only 2x20mins per day i have been to a 3 star hotel that was much better than this 
 my son insisted watching cartoons in spanish on the tv could not find any decent channels in english 
 cleaning
 tv did not work safe did not work room key had to be replaced charged twice for breakfast
 american tv is absent complete joke considering 13 separate languages countries are represented this has to be an intentional slight 
 shabby bathroom carpet frayed
 no air con
 everything was okay 
 sound insulation was a bit poor
 nothing 
 too much noise could be heard from neighbours and people chatting on the corridor the windows in our room weren t double glazed so the noise of blue light sirens disturbed us throughout night it was also quite cold as the heating wasn t on but i think this is due to ongoing building work 
 the room was a little small but i stayed in a single room 
 no comment
 my mattress was not very comfortable not terrible but could have been better 
 heating in room set to high so was very warm we used the bar after the show at the albert hall but had to sit at the bar the waitress said she would get us a table as soon as one was free but forgot the waitress at breakfast brought us half toasted toast and we had to ask for clean knives and more plates and returned with fork knife and spoon 
 the internet coverage was terrible no service in the room each room only gets one internet code we had 3 people in the room and only one could use the internet i would not stay in the future because i am on business and need service 
 door knobs were stiff and hard to rotate to open our children had hard time opening the door 
 bar long wait at 2100 on monday 31st july no staff around and surprised when i did get served that a service charge was included for 1 order of only 2 drinks what should have been a relaxing drink after a long day quite frankly annoyed me needless to say i did not return 
 house keeping poor room furnishing are basic for the price bathroom and shower has safety concerns 
 on arrival there was a mix up with finding reservations that were there didn t find it tip hours after should be more professional
 no extra pillows available on request king size bed was a small king air conditioning was not working properly on a hot day and no windows to open 
 noise from next door room late at night sounded like the occupants were just talking but the sound travelled too well via the connecting door and seemed very loud at 1am both nights 
 small room hard bed 
 there was a further city tax charged at 5 that was not included or mentioned until i came to check out i don t know why this wasn t included in the price of the room with the other taxes 
 i payed 100 gbp more than i should because a mistake of one of the team 
 the lobby is rather small i like stronger lighting 
 small room 
 cooling in the hotel communal spaces not good 
 nothing it was perfect 
 very expensive to eat and drink in 
 i found the room a little hot bit noisy if you open the window 
 view was not of stadium but the back of offices receptionist couldn t speak or understand english 
 the hotel had overbooked some rooms thankfully ours had been reserved many people were complaining as they were left with no room the rooms were small and the air con was freezing as we didn t know how to switch off 
 no sausages on breakfast
 staff please dont recommend the mango tree restaurant got bad food poisoning citizenm is excellent 
 queue for breakfast at peak times however staff were very friendly and helpful and kept waiting times to a minimum
 bed making could have been better however we did have clean towels each day
 i liked everything 
 the staff of the hotel useless the did not bothers at all of my request they promise to do it but they did not many times and they lies a lot even no coffee or tea in the room after cleaning or room service fridge it was out of order they promised to fix it but the never send the engineer to my room even i have been reported many time to the hotel reception
 room was quite noisy due to gap between double glazing and window frame 
 they debited my cc by 52 and thy were never able to show me either the document or the proper justification this hotel is a total rip off they suggested that next i should book directly with hotel and in that case they would give me a 10 voucher never going to stay in this hotel again 
 small room no a c 
 it was advertised at 4 stars but it was was a 2 3 star
 all in all everything was good 
 room v cold pool more like a roof top water feature location v central if you didn t mind walking past all the prostitutes after dark
 mattresses were bad rooms a bit noisy shower wasn t very clean breakfast very minimal choice 
 cleanliness especially at the breakfast saloon you could see that the dishes were dirty so they were not washing them properly the tea pot looked like it had never been washed before 
 first my room window had just bottom lock and the top one was broken in january it is cold weather so wind and coldness blew throught the window even heating could not help so it was cold also up to the bed there is mirror design which had crack so it was not nice furthermore on the wall next to tv suppose to light led lights which ones did not also breakfast canteen is so unorganised and messy however i thought i will take coffee to my room unfortunately security stopped me and demanded to leave coffee in canteen 
 can t open the window in the room old 
 there was no air conditioning in the room not fitted but a fan was provided not ideal but better than nothing considering the hot weather the bar closed at 11pm which seemed very early for a central london hotel 
 food choice limited 
 there was a bit smoky scent in the bathroom probably some previous tenant was smoking in the bathroom 
 at breakfast food was not replaced i asked for bacon after 20 mins no bacon requested the manager who said sorry did nothing after 15 mins still no bacon complain to acting manager who threatened to evict me and call police for threatening him my wife i are 80yrs of age we were celebrating her birthday at no time did i threaten him we left dining room without breakfast the other guest all said they were disappointed and told the acting manager so he ignored all protestations 
 rooms extremely small for two people barely any space to move around including the toilets and no view internet was terrible and was not fixed even though we asked for a faster alternative multiple times only 0 5 mb download speed 
 nothing
 didnt like the bar staff a little rude
 upgraded room but only had a walk in shower no bath one lift was out of order and the other was painfully slow waiting nearly 5 mins for lift from the 5th floor 
 the room is very small we wake up with some noise that other enter to take a shower we cannot enter our clothes into room the price is higher and not include breakfast and very far from metro station only one elevator and has capacity for two person 
 the room was comfortable but a little small by european standards it was probably acceptable the bed was comfortable which means a lot to me when traveling the maids did clean the room daily and that is a plus with me the hotel restaurant only opened for breakfast although the bar offered limited fare i did find numerous small restaurants close to the hotel and by and large the prices were reasonable i must have missed the prepaid breakfast option but the hotel only charged 14 eur for breakfast which was reasonable 
 nothing
 staff were short with guests not as charming or willing as they were on our fist visit shortly after the the hotel opened
 no welcome drink frosty welcome from receptionist who was complaining about another customer unprofessional lift not working no room service at night reception call for takeaway that took over an hour peeling paint in room expensive in room snacks out of date limited expensive bar drinks neglected facilities noisy cleaners in corridor early in morning 
 when i checked in the receptionist took 30 to cover any extras which is understandable however they will only refund me within 5 working days not acceptable 
 the cost is really high i stay often with work but i always look for somewhere cheaper local to it 
 it was mentioned during the time of booking that breakfast is complimentary from bookings com but i had to pay as the confirmation had mentioned extra 
 there was no bath in our rooms so we were unable to give our grand daughter a proper bath 
 everything
 the breakfast experience was v disappointing no cuttlery on table no milk in table jug and a number of breakfast food items were missing milk for cornflakes orange juice 
 breakfast was ridiculously expensive
 next door neighboor is a sex shop
 housekeeping personnel were a little aggressive about getting into the room to clean we felt rushed to get out of the room and it was only 1000 and we were staying another night 
 the windows are not double glazed so there is quite a bit of traffic noise 
 my room was quite cold even after putting temperature up to 32 degrees 
 the service at the bar in the evening was a little variable sometimes ok sometimes not so ok 
 the breakfast was a bit more than a bit disappointing the waiters looked always annoyed and if you order eggs you will wait forever and before the closing time by 15 minutes dont think that the empty bread counter or anything else for that matter would be replenished totally contrasting with the rest of the hotel service feel and look 
 minibar not working parking lot is not free
 the toilet seat is on a much higher height than normal
 single room excellent training for my trip to the international space station cramped no storage access to electric sockets required kneeling etc good job the cat was not with me because i would not have been able to swing it bed although comfortable felt it was on a slight angle to the right from the horizontal had to climb on the bed to suit window and draw blind road noise just about bareable 
 definitely not a 4 star hotel despite managements protestations to the contrary over priced for what you get not a great location a solid 20 minute walk to the centre of town the majority of attractions no tea coffee facilities provided in room when we requested these it took several days for them to arrive wireless was so slow we gave up trying to use it initial room we were allocated was extremely noisy we could clearly hear when people in the next room used the toilet had sex etc street traffic noise was bad staff were helpful in moving us to another room but this was still very noisy hotel management claims rooms are sound proofed but this was certainly not our experience lots of young exchange students staying at the hotel contributed to a rather noisy environment 
 the bathroom was a bit basic and we didn t like having a shower curtain it felt a bit like student accommodation 
 nothing
 standard room is small
 basically every thing based on my 1st experience with them from 23 to 25 i did not come back to them and i booked another hotel where i loss my mony since my reservation with them is not refundable about 900 kd
 staff not a good welcoming and when complained staff did not seemed bothered when booking i asked for an upper storey room i get there and they gave me a level 2 out of 13 room my view was some flats considering when paying 144 per night without breakfast and not even get asked how was your stay 
 appreciate a teapot and for the ladies a dressing table mirror would be good 
 the room was clean but badly in need of an update cracks in the hand basin furniture badly marked the toilet needed bleaching 
 the abandoned building next to the hotel is scary chairs at dining hall like plastic garden chairs far from centre 
 very small room compared to price will not stay at this hotel again 
 weak wifi not good collection of breakfast choices the rooms are old we didnt enter our rooms till 4 p m and we are waitinf since 10 a m
 the shower turn on off knobs were really really bad too too tight to turn on off and absolutely no grip 
 no alcohol available on premises
 30mins tram ride to city centre and few places to eat at around the hotel 
 there is no way to open windows you could hear everything coming from the bathroom no privacy 
 staff was very helpful to our daily needs however their suggestions on restaurants involved some very expensive places with disappointing results moreover when the tap needed fixing they never attended to it even though they were instantly informed by the cleaning ladies 
 unfortunately the fire alarm went off at 7 40am making us jump but at least it works 
 had to pay for wifi breakfast was cold
 can t fault anything 
 showers cold in the morning and simply over priced as are all london hotels 
 the staff and their hospitality
 nothing
 drinks expensive in hotel bar 2 double vodkas 23 
 the bar staff were lovely and enjoyed a nice chat with them however it was hard to get away because they wouldn t stop talking 
 the tiles in the bathroom looked like they hadnt been cleaned in weeks the heater was blowing cold air regardless the setting it was on the shower head was dirty
 old super rude staff 
 air con was a little noisy and not very cold but other than that all was fantastic
 the shower toilet being see through 
 could have been a little bit more reasonably priced in house parking very expensive 
 the breakfast could ve been better although it s correct 
 we didn t like the stuff in the restaurant during breakfast one stuffer a young woman greeted the guests in a not so nice manner cleaned the tables and filled the bouffet up without cleaning her hands 
 nothing 
 bathroom too small
 there appeared to be only one lift for the whole hotel but in an historic building like this it was a small price to pay
 did not get free wifi till spoke to manager
 the room given to us was next to the elevator and after we insisted on change the staff accommodated our request and changed our room 
 the bathroom door and walls should be cleaned also because there was stains i used to clean with detol wipes the air conditioner wasn t working and i used to open the window but there was noise coming from the street 
 the location is not central to all amsterdam attractions as stated it s a 25mintue tram ride breakfast is not great and a 22 00 each is not value for money 
 building work was going on at the hotel not informed of this when i booked room was in the basement smelt funny 
 the room was too far
 staff on reception were a bit slow to book me in
 the guest relations incharge would hv a stsndard snswer to all my queries saying she would call back sometimes she would and most times not call at all
 nothing
 no sink in toilet room faced train station so was noisy with trains 
 the room is very very small although i didn t book the smallest type of room god knows how small the smallest room is the air conditioner is noisy needs proper maintenance hot without it noisy with it for that much inconvenience i paid way too much for its value i don t recommend 
 having to change lifts at first floor got to be a bit nauseous towards the end of our stay otherwise nothing to complain or worry about 
 not good value for maney
 nothing
 parking is a bit too far it is not in the hotel but a few block away 
 no free wifi in room
 small bathroom
 food and drink a bit to pricey
 the offer doesn t satisfy the demand
 nothing
 would have liked bottled water provided every day as part of service instead of mini bar fee no ironing board in room dishwasher but no washing machine which was not a problem for us but was unclear in the booking com room description 
 nothing
 nothing
 the gym is very small 
 i believe they are renovating the whole hotel the common stairs need a bit of the magic they ve dome with the rooms 
 the restaurants were too expensive
 the lighting in the room was quite dark two young girls getting ready for a night out could have done with better lighting 
 we didn t like the breakfast and their was no wifi in the rooms
 room was very dirty the bed in the room above us squeaked all night 
 n a
 view
 no negatives everything was great
 dirty needs refurb tiny rooms tiny bathroom very poir
 this was a 4 star hotel but i was disappointed the hotel room was dirty bathroom caulking had mold curtains were stained bed cover was stained carpet had stains ceiling had some water damage or other issue room chair was dirty the tub was also very tall 24 inches and was difficult for my wife to exit lastly the maid service never seemed to get it right all the time and was always forgetting something one day it was the soap next day it was the coffee next day it was not cleaning the cups 
 room was small air con was weak over priced 
 not really bad but someone of the reception wasn t very attentive
 none
 stains and mouldy curtains dusty shelves in room unfriendly breakfast staff
 n a
 help with luggage when leaving non existent which was odd because everything else was perfect 
 1 we booked a room for three people and there was only a double bed in our room so we went to the reception to ask what was going on they promised us to bring an extra bed in an hour so we went for a walk when we came back in 3 hours there still was nothing so we asked once again and they managed to solve this problem by 2 am taking into consideration that we had to leave to the airport at 8 we didn t have a rest 2 no shampoo and shower gel in the room only for one person 3 broken facilities see photos 4 extra fee not stated in the booking for this mess we had to pay 5 euro extra pro person so 15 euro 5 poor breakfast 6 dirty walls
 location wasn t the greatest but the efficient metro helps with this issue also bignami stop only down the street opposite 
 fixed checkin hours old building old interior
 a bit noisy in early morning can weak you
 liked to location but there was a noisy building site outside blocking all views no tv signal very annoying after a long day out travelling toilet had marks basin did not empty quickly had blockage 
 windows cannot be opened so there is no way to get fresh air 
 the room linens didn t seem very fresh 
 the room we had was small too small the breakfast is everything but english and rather minimalistic the wifi you have to pay for 10 pounds for 3 nights you have a connection but you cannot read your mail 
 the rat and the mouse we saw on nights one and two respectively
 we booked a double room but were provided a twin room on arrival we were given a much smaller room when we pointed this out room was so small that we had no space where to put luggage also we were provided with single quilts which are not ideal for a double bed on more than one occasion i came across dirty cups in the breakfast room 
 everything was fine 
 nothing at all
 decor facilities variable staff attitude would rather a hotel that worked than one that offered free drinks for things that didn t 
 rude staff on reception
 would rather have nescafe than kenco coffee in the room 
 nothing
 twin beds rather than a double very minor issue didn t fancy paying 20 euros for breakfast 
 n a
 nothing
 price is way too high for the room standards
 room service
 the toilet is stuck after we finish of shower everytime 
 everything was great 
 the only blip was that we put a pair of shoes outside our room to be cleaned in a bag we found in the room provided for that purpose but when we looked outside the next morning the bag was not there neither was the complimentary times we had ordered a call to reception quickly resolved this however shoes times were brought to our room the shoes had been cleaned very well 
 they don t have bath slippers 
 if you re looking for egg breakfast plan some additional time and rather stay with the classics 
 is expensive but is london
 despite paying for an upgrade the room was extremely small there was only a narrow staircase leading to the first floor and corridors leading to the room were a tight squeeze 
 facilities were limited but the bar was nice 
 the room is too small for two people luguage there wasnt any place for my friend staff 
 shower door wet outside despite of careful procedure 3 nespresso for two persons is too poor in the room
 food and drink expensive no breakfast included
 not very close to centre 
 noisy old room poor wi fi
 the wi fi connection was too bad for such a hotel cost 
 the only downside is the view from the rooms but it is compensated by other things 
 1st floor rom was very cold room heating only with air condition did not work properly
 maid walked in at half eight and woke us up reception were poor service no smiles or anything and not helpful at all annoying that you have to pay a 50 deposit for the room on arrival paying stupidly high london prices for an above average room i have stayed in a double tree in milton keynes for half the price and the staff and bedrooms were far better
 lighting in room was very dim the hotel could not provide a brighter reading lamp room heating only just adequate would have liked a less expensive eating option than the restaurant 
 going 
 nothing
 what i didn t like was the location of my room interestingly enough when i open my nice wide room window i was looking directly to a grave a cemetery just outside the window the least they could do was ask us if we don t mind having a grave site as a view i was thinking the front desk staff didn t like us and purposely did it as a surprise not nice i was not able to sleep well that night 
 slow lifts
 a very small niggle we only had one drawer in the bedroom my friend lived out of her suitcase this did not detract from the holiday or the hotel 
 feel the hotel exterior appearance can deter people
 our car was broken into in the secure car park that we were advised to park in after visiting the police station a police officer told us that he s had problems with the receptionists in the hotel not warning people that the car park is a hotspot for break ins also the receptionist admitted to us after we reported the break in that she doesn t park her car there because of the high chance of crime really disappointed with our stay and annoyed we listened to the advise to move our car from a secure car park to their not so secure car park very expensive stay for us and have had to continue our trip around the netherlands with a broken window
 free parking spaces are extremely limited so only option is expensive pay and display doesn t say this clearly and was our main reason for booking 
 our room smelt of smoke the 1st room we had had a window broken so we could hear all the outside noise luckily we got moved very expensive on drinks and food
 breakfast in the morning bread stale meats cheeses out for over an hour not kept refridgerated breach on food safety standards coffee luke warm in the flask
 no olives in breakfast 
 small room
 in my room it was noisy because of the windows facing the street in addition the air conditioning in the room works pretty noisy 
 the restaurant and bar the food at breakfast was poor no hard cheese no jam no marmalade bread was hard im not fussy but a bit of soft bread and cheese is not a lot to ask for as the hotel isnt cheap plenty of lettuce tomato and cake worse was having to chase a waiter to get any coffee or tea as it is not self service and was never offered if youre lucky you may get some at the end of your breakfast the bar staff in the evening ignored us for 10 minutes despite the bar being open and no customers they made eye contact several times but carried on setting up for breakfast eventually we left the hotel and went to a bar around the corner where we had wonderful service 
 room was too hot and slightly small for the price also no window apart from a shuttered skylight in the roof
 room with views do not always have good views i was in the third floor and because of the trees i couldn t see paseo de gracia gym definitely needs to be improved first by having more space and then by improving the machines specially the treadmill 
 all ok
 room had a window with the generators outside the generators were so noisy it was hard to sleep them room felt dirty and is in desperate need of an update would have preferred no kitchenette and instead a bigger room with bigger tv 
 nothing to complain about 
 the bed need to be changed its used and old
 bed is very soft personally would have preferred a firmer bed
 bathrooms do need better ventilation as some other reviewers have already remarked 
 breakfast is way too expensive 25e per person so we went out for breakfast
 lifts
 bathroom floor was too cold would have been better if there had been a radiator in the bathroom
 no free internet on room is bad and the 10 day internet was awful very bad 
 efficiency and reactivity of staff shower layout was not comfortable at all no door and therefore the whole bathroom becomes messy we asked for high story room we got the one on gf i couldnt found something suitable for me to eat the night of my arrival i informed the room service that i dont eat meat being vegeterian got chicken in my salad 
 the rooms are very small but i seen a lot of other reviews before hand so wasn t really expecting much else anyway very nice hotel overall
 nothing hotel was perfect
 drink prices
 receptionists need better training and should have good command of speaking english 
 location should you decide to use the metro line it s about 15 min walk away and you will go through a pretty bad neighborhood housekeeping changed the sheets only the 3rd day of our stay and only after we made a complaint twice heating did not work in the room and it got pretty cold during the night staff uninterested 
 paying parking not very close 200 meters only two elevators always crowded too crowded in the morning difficult to find a place for breakfast 
 the rain
 i had booked breakfast with my stay and was challenged on at least four separate occasions to say breakfast wasn t included despite showing them my booking receipt once was while i was actually eating the breakfast that and part of the shower was broken in my room the bar staff whilst very friendly did have to ask for my drinks order 4 times as well a theme despite the other 5 in my party getting their drinks about 10 minutes before me the staff were very apologetic but one drink from their cocktail menu shouldn t be too difficult to make 
 the ac in the room was not the best
 we had two tv s but one didn t work for our daughters bed viewing told staff for five days and wasn t resovled 
 breakfast is too expensive
 
 a minor thing but we used up the shower gel on the first day and it was not replaced when the room was cleaned 
 layout of room and no kettle to make tea or coffee also drinks in bar very expensive 
 the reception staff were brusque and impolite as were the breakfast staff exception of one individual i met initially i gave the benefit of the doubt i will not return 
 would have like to be able to have more coffee in our room 2 for 2 days
 there was a buzzing noise that went on all night in our room coming from the ceiling the window was broken when we had gotten there
 shower room toilet and the shock tub wash in the middle of the room 
 very hard bed 
 room had no air conditioning stay was in early august and it was warm in the room don t remember seeing that mentioned anywhere when i booked the room on your site 
 tv had a bad picture on all channels
 no free wifi
 asked for late checkout for one hour wanted to charge 10 pounds 
 rooftop bar service a little slow
 breakfast was terribly tasteless
 the room wasn t cleaned properly especially bathroom the sink s and tub s pipes had to be blocked because the water wasn t flushing through them not very hygienic breakfast extremely expensive you can get a very good food for haft the price from nearby pret a manger 
 although room comfortable was small
 i made the mistake of valet parking 24 for 24 hours when in the past i have parked at westfield a few hundred yards away at a fraction of the cost
 sound proofing noise from the road can be heard clearly 
 not quiet enough
 it was not obvious that therewas a regular shuttle service from schiphol no plug in bathroom sink no shampoo skin cream etc in bathroom breakfast area was dirty and chaotic no door on shower so almost whole bathroom floor ended up wet
 there wasn t anything we didn t like 
 breakfast was fairly expensive 19 per person given the high standard of everything else in the room the sheets felt remarkably cheap and not particularly comfortable we had a junior suite which was laid out somewhat oddly the toilet and shower opened directly onto the main room meaning very little privacy not a problem for a married couple but still potentially awkward for others 
 too far from the city centre 10 tram stops took around 25 minutes the open plan shower was okay but not sure the toilet needs to be too 
 drunk guest everywhere
 the suit is too small its suppose to consider as room the reception poor facilities
 twin bedded double room too tight for 2 people
 the smell in the stairs we didn t have a view of the street a bit too expensive 
 we were put into a disabled room for some reason not explained to us it was very clinical especially the bathroom and with no shower which is what we required our breakfast was cleared away whilst we were getting some coffee 
 area needs more restaurant options looks marred by construction but that will change 
 the air conditioning would appear to only work later in the year 
 the washbasin in my room was a little blocked
 when i checked in i was 2nd in the queue and when i got to the front the receptionist changed desks and started serving someone in the next queue when i questioned her she said that the computer was broken thankfully the lady in the other queue let me go in front of her when i was then served i was given someone else s form to sign check in was unprofessional and chaos 
 the price of breakfast is way to expenesive 25 euro per person the location is perfect and the hotel is gorgeous 
 only the breakfast could be hot on the self serve apart from that no other problems 
 breakfast is a bit too expensive especially when there are two of you 
 nothing to dislike but a bit pricey
 there was a construction at the hotel i couldn t sleep well it was annoying 
 tiny things the clothes line in the bathroom didn t work the bathroom could use another shelf for products don t english hotels recycle i hated putting recycling in the garbage pail 
 it is very old need renovation
 nothing
 air conditioner terrible
 they need time to pring them to the best
 i think that the breakfast could be better priced 
 check in was very slow very understaffed and when you were getting checked in the procedure seemed to take an extremely long time it was painful 
 drinks prices very expensive ok for a treat but at nearly 20 per drink not likely to have too many service in brasserie very slow but food excellent once it arrives and not too expensive for what it was 
 very happy with this hotel
 the curtains let in too much light from the street to make a cup of tea i had to use the hot water from the coffee machine which resulted in my tea tasting vaguely of coffee 
 rooms breakfast room no wifi connection
 nothing i could fault at alll
 thought breakfast was included but was told was not
 the price of breakfast and room little bit too small
 breakfast is below expectations no variety at all 
 lift was out of order the room not easy to find and no indication where it was had to call staff to show 
 check in was appalling room not ready after 2 hrs then one staff joked about the fact they had given our room away by accident 
 only issue is that the single room was too small whilst this is not unusual for london it was difficult to unpack pack and move or work at the desk and even the shower was a little tight so definitely one of the smallest i ve experienced 
 all good but if the breakfast was included it would have been perfect the room was very good on 3rd floor and balcony view of the arch 
 customer service was terrible
 the room size but not crucial
 i would say that our bathroom could do with being updated as it was noticeably rusty otherwise it was a great stay 
 first of all i arrived lugging 2 bags and there were two ladies at the reception and neither of them acknowledged the fact that a guest had arrived till i opened the door and asked for help with my bags then the lady who checked me in was rude and condescending my husband made the reservation and used his card i had said card on me when i checked in but i was told that since the card wasn t in my name i couldn t use it i m sure she would have thrown me into the street if i hadn t asked if i could pay cash it was even more ridiculous because i had just arrived from brussels where i had used the same card to pay for my room then there was the search for an iron but a very nice member of staff was kind enough to track one down just in the nick of time he was really helpful 
 poor view and hair grips left in our room
 no kettle in the room
 no desk 
 rooms in need of tlc pricey for what it is
 shower glass too small water splashing in toilet floor 
 restaurant staff was very slow 
 the first room we were given didn t live up to the reviews or the photos on the website for the same standard of room we were initially very disappointed however after speaking to reception we were shown three alternative rooms all of which were exactly what we were expecting and we selected from those can t say fairer than that 
 lifts availability unreliable
 price 
 we did not like the heat coming off the lights over the bathroom mirror making the room almost impossible to stay in the only other mirror was in the hall and it was poorly lit 
 when asked about the pool we were told it was open all day when we went down the next morning it was shut for 2 hours meaning we weren t able to swim because of our train time 
 in room facilities a bit sparse lack of mini bar for example 
 there was nothing we didn t enjoy about our stay at this hotel 
 breakfast without vegetables
 staff were not clear enough on payments 
 the day a big business group were staying one male staff member in dining room was very curt to other guests other days were fine 
 restaurant delays caused us to have to eat our dinners separately alleviated by reduction but still unfortunate
 paris prices 
 not enough plugs no ac no way to open window generally uncomfortable 
 the walls are paper thin we didn t get a single good nights sleep due to being woken up throughout the night by staff and drunken people in the hallway 
 this hote never like to 4 star 
 room did not have window with good views was a basement suite and for the price i thought should have been lighter
 hairs in bathroom
 the room way too smaller than expected for almost 300 a night i expect something better after flew for 15 hours but as the location quite central just be positive that i paid for the location 
 how the shower and the bathroom are right in the middle of the room a bit awkward if there is another person in the room 
 staff rude i was proposing to my partner and i asked for maybe a letter of congratulations in the room and hoped like some nice hotels maybe a little gift too but nothing was done apart from a really quickly written note 
 old elevator
 not enough hangars and drawers for clothes 
 the shower was a little odd for us it s huge but there s a long window on the side of the shower it goes in to a hall so it s not like anyone walked past just a little less private 
 firstly the room wasn t ready the male manager was extremely rude to the receptionist who was only a trainee we were taken on a wild goose chase around the hotel as they hurriedly tried to find a room to fit us in and he even had the cheek to say it was upgraded the breakfast left a lot to be desired with the sausages looking limp and the eggs resembling a pile of sick the cacophony of noise emitting from the man woman buffalo from another room which sounded like their lungs were falling out their nose
 left the room between 11 00am to 16 00 on the 1st of january and the room wasn t cleaned on time i assume it was due to skeleton staff on the day 
 needed to get into argument with staff before getting a car park space 
 long walks from lifts
 no frigo bar into the room and no slippery available
 it shows ageing signs it can get noisy on the streets and due to the old construction the noise is not canceled out the windows were clearly not clean 
 the room was small which was the least of our worries the shower kept going hot and cold which was annoying the stairwell lights were out which considering it was a narrow spiral staircase was not good the first time in over 50 years of travel paper cups were provided in our room and we got one tea bag in our room on the first day of our stay no more were provided when we arrived for breakfast on the 3rd and 4th days at 8 30am there was no muesli no croissants all the white cheese had gone so had most of the meat when we spoke to the person looking after the breakfast the approach was so what the girl on the desk however arranged for someone to go out and get some croissants the piece de resistance however occurred on our last night we watched the rio olympics until after 11 and then couldn t turn off the tv the batteries in the control had corroded i replaced them but the terminals had gone there was no switch on the tv so i had to remove the tv from the wall to get at the wall switch the real issue was that all the problems were avoidable with a little care and planning 
 the rooms were a bit on the small side but in a city with so much to do that s not an issue 
 the bathroom had nowhere to put our toiletries we had to leave them on the floor sunday s pastries were certainly not from the same morning room service did not get our orders right 3 times 
 while the single room is spacious the shower towel seemed smaller than standard size and overused bed frame has sharp edges this could hurt if you fall against them 
 when we checked in we were asked if we wanted to join the loyalty club which would give us a free morning paper and as it was a special occasion we were told we had the movies for free in the room when we got back in the evening there were no movies and on checking out we were charged 6 for the paper it was my husbands 30th so when we got back to the hotel around midnight we decided to have a night cap however despite a fully stocked bar we were told wine beer and champagne were the only options i can t quite understand why they wouldn t be available 
 nothing
 they did nor filled my needs
 nothing every thing was great
 it is not a complain it would be better if the restaurant and meeting room were on the ground floor not basement 
 building opposite being demolished very noisy after 7 30 am no alarm clock required
 that the pool was out of use and having breakfast was a stressful experience 
 side street where hotel is located is dirty 
 nothing 
 pool could be bigger and deeper but we had a great time 
 bath was dirty from previous use lack of english of staff at breakfast
 front lower rooms a little noisy 
 a little bit far away from the train station but for the price it s a great location 
 all good
 i had a sea view room in 7th floor and is amusing 
 none
 the hotel manager was not helpful at all we booked a room for 3 adults they sent us to a room with one bed so we went back to the front desk to ask for different accommodations and his answer was that is the way all our hilton hotel rooms are not true as we stay in hilton quite often we then asked for adjoining rooms as we were not all going to fit in one bed and although he did find one we had to make 3 trips back from the elevator as the keys they made continued to not work we were very frustrated and the hotel manager never once apologised for their mistakes the bed in the main room was incredibly uncomfortable and the room was not clean dirty cups spoons and a partially opened coffee pack will be reporting this to corporate hilton as well no one should have to go through this frustrating experience while traveling 
 our room was a budget room and it was very small 
 nothing it was perfect
 the price was high but they did not offer english breakfast in the price but were charging 20 00 each for some bread and jam 
 nothing bad
 no lock on the bathroom door
 larger bathroom required for the executive suite 
 out with the city centre but located right next to major metro train bus station and public transport is great easily takes you into the city centre for cheap prices 
 although clean bathroom was in need of several repairs shower door was a folding device that missed a hinge or two and collapsed into one s standing room while showering no outlet in bathroom no mirror in room itself no air conditioner although fan provided view of courtyard just a hallow area between buildings nothing scenic not an overly comfortable bed neither of us slept well note that restaurant while reputedly very good closes for a month each summer as of about 23 july parking in their underground garage must be reserved in advanced if you don t see this option when booking your hotel room consider calling the hotel to arrange as nearest parking garage cost us a fixed fee of 35 euro and the garage only opens each morning at 9 am 
 the size of the room and specially the closet hardly any hanging space unbelievable that a hotel of that level or price should have that type of closet space furthermore the w ter closet did not work too well 
 circle line wasn t running so was a hassle to get to executive double was small no view 3pm check in 
 it was very hot in the rooms and on speaking with the hotel they were not willing to put the air conditioning on additionally we had a room next to a very noisy street 
 parking is very expensive 
 the set up of the bathroom the toilet was in one room with no sink so you had to flush then go to the shower part and wash your hands there the shower door wasn t long enough and the water flooded out if you didn t pay attention
 shower could have been hotter
 could not fault it
 my room was smaller and much darker than my friend s room with whom we paid the same and reserved the same room type my room was at 1st floor hers was at 2nd next time i will make sure at the time of the reservation about 2nd floor or above especially if i pay the same with the ones at 2nd floor or above 
 the breakfast option is quite limited poor selection of choices no room service food available 24 7 in the lounge area but during the weekend this place is extermely loud and full of drunkies 
 if you want an english breakfast this is a bad choice good selection for continental style breakfast but just bacon and pitiful sausage available and eggs to order no mushrooms tomatoes etc also breakfast is served in the bar area at the front of the hotel not in a dining room so bear this in mind 
 transport options to the o2 
 the beds are on rollers which means every time you move the bed moves the beds are also incredibly soft and bouncy which doesn t help if they re on rollers we booked a twin room but were only given one flannel and one set of toiletries we asked 5 times over the space of 5 hours if we could have an additional flannel and toiletries eventually they were left in our room in the room description it says the room is equipped with an iron and ironing board but in fact you had to request them again it took 5 requests over the space of 5 hours the iron and ironing board were delivered but as we weren t in our room they left them outside in the corridor which meant that i had to then lug a huge ironing board into the room it was so big it took up the entire space in the room there is a sign in the room saying that it has been newly renovated but there is a rip in the leather chair which has been badly mended and the room just looks old and tired as with a lot of these hotels there were no sockets by the bed which is ridiculous in this day and age considering this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel the food is poor we ordered a quinoa salad and a salmon open sandwich and the salad had more walnuts in it than quinoa the sandwich came with crisps which is normal but they were really potent cheese and onion flavoured not the best with salmon we asked if we could have cocktails but were told that cocktails were off that night because they were re printing the list we asked if we could have a mocha and they didn t know how to make it on the 2nd morning i decided to treat myself to breakfast in bed and ordered a continental breakfast so was surprised to discover a full english instead the coffee was cold as was the toast all in all we were not impressed with the hotel considering how much we paid and considering that it is in such a smart location i would not recommend this hotel to anyone 
 if the room was only 10 12 square feet larger i could call it exceptional and an excellent excellent value for a couple for a single guest it could work very well as it stands 
 terrace bar should be open longer than 11 pm
 bathroom very bad
 the power sockets were poor and were unreliable
 the way my credit card was debited during my stay 2 times without any notification before checking out again my credit card was debited for the 3 rd time and even after i left the hotel my credit card was debited on the second day when i reach lebanon most probably because they forgot to check the mini bar so honestly as an advise pay cash don t take the breakfast in the hotel go outside it is way more enjoyable extremely poor and stingy breakfast we reserved a suite the water from the shower was brown literally brown we call the reception they said no there is no problem nobody cared to check we left without shower in the evening just a small word from the reception you were right we fixed it honestly will never ever visit this property again 
 noisy room near the elevator and too hot opening the window was not an option due to outside noise breakfast not ready at opening ie no eggs staff unhappy
 only criticism is the lack of a kettle in the room 
 the spa area was a total let down
 the construction work at the entrance but the hotel staff made everything possible to make up for it 
 none
 unpleasant smell in corridor
 no kettle only coffee machine in room 
 only negative the bathroom was tiny and a big person would have had trouble although i have no doubt the staff would have done everything possible to move me if required 
 it would be better if they put slippers in the room 
 no shower cap in the bathroom although the breakfast was nice for 12 50 i expected better and have had better apart from that it was a very pleasant hotel and would stay again
 bathroom facilities were not great room was very small 
 decor was a bit dated and the room wasn t as clean as i would have liked 
 i believe the hotel is in the process of updating rooms however they did not inform us that work would be taking place during our stay so it would be fair to say it was a surprise disappointing to be awoken at 9 45 on monday morning to the sound of banging drilling when we were hoping to have a lie in prior to check out also the room had a leaking kettle 
 sofa bed extremely uncomfortable
 room business class a bit basic 
 other people staying at the hotel were rude to the staff 
 limited gluten free options at the restaurant 
 1 the cooling was just a normal air it was pretty bad the first room i got was on the corner of 5th floor the cooling there was horrible i then complained to which they changed my room as if they know that this room had problem with cooling the new room was on same floor it was better with cooling but still wasn t enough they have provided thick blankets with which sleeping was a nightmare i even have to open the window in order to sleep well 2 the mattress in sofa was with springs and springs literally pinches you while sleeping 3 the room service wasn t efficient on the first morning while leaving the room i put their provided tag mentioning that you can clean the room and when i was back on night nothing was cleaned next day i did the same and went directly to reception in order to tell them the lady there said that have you put something on the door to which i said yes and then she said that s why they didn t service your room but i said the tag was mentioning that you can clean the room mentioning directly that i am not in the room so you can clean it god knows what are there policies but the impression was quite bad 
 no wifi in rooms
 a little noise down the street during the weekends
 horrid pillows and bed very hard room cold 
 uncomfortable bed
 nothing bad to say at all 
 had to get a tram to centre of amsterdam
 rooms are quiet small and quite warm our room was next to some sort of fan which was going all night but because of the noise we couldn t open the window 
 no swimming pool as advertised no gym facility not child friendly poor access poor breakfast buffet choices tv channel limited
 no lift and we were on 3rd floor requested another hairdryer but did not get one hallways and carpets were a little tired and needed repainting
 nothing
 room terribly small and access to bed limited 
 bedroom layout fine for lone travellers or younger couples but awkward for senior couples 
 i got an extremely small room without window without prior information
 no fridge in room 
 box like room for unreasonable price with a view of scaffolding
 everything apart from the restaurant
 the mattrasses easily slipped away and the elastic springs stung hard in the back
 the bed even if very comfortable might be not big enough for taller people but still ok 
 swimming pool and changing rooms showers there were dirty
 had to walk up one flight of stairs take a one person elevator to the fourth floor and walk up another flight of stairs to reach the room 
 elevators out of order issues
 very very dated
 a little cramped for 3 persons breakfast average and the bacon always burnt 
 potentially dangerous getting in out of shower no safety rail 
 breakfast was very bad there is only pork salami you dont have any choice if you dont eat pork there is very limited choice of food isolation of the room was very bad you can hear what they talk in next room there is no minibar 
 it s far from being a 4 star hotel
 check in staff were lovely but when we checked out the person who checked us out wasn t as friendly 
 room is a little small but thats what you get in london
 air conditioning can only be switched off after calling the reception 3 times then still a remaining sound of the installation remains all night long
 morning newspaper not provided until we requested 
 there was an annoying tapping noise in our room at night time
 switching off the air conditioning in the middle of the night is crazy we all ending up waking up at 5am gasping for breath 
 they took my payment from my card when i first arrived and again as i left saying they had not taken my money already poor training and communication
 needs some decorating in the rooms
 the hotel was very basic and looked like it could do with a makeover the hallway carpets were very dirty
 the receptionist gentleman was not smiling i felt a bit awkward as if i did something wrong by coming but he did his job completely and perfectly 
 couldn t get the shower hot just warm and the mattress was a bit too hard 
 1 breakfast buffet is way too small for a 5 star hotel 2 furniture in the rooms is old and slightly damaged 3 hotel is not in the city center of amsterdam location is kind of bad 
 the breakfast area is too small and sunday we were waiting almost one hour for having any seats plus no one helped us i asked the personal if they can let us know when will have a table free no answer till the end we were sitting on the corner where everyone was looking at us with mercy was a bit embarrassing
 maybe the temperature control from the ac heater was so limited 3 c anyway i would not hesitate to come back next time i need overnight in barcelona 
 wifi was a bit slow the bathrobes had a few stains on them 
 very expensive but i would pay it again 
 though friendly the staffs efficiency is sometimes lacking especially at the gail s kitchen downstairs
 bar closed ad midnight but drinks bottle of wine available at frontdesk at more than reasonable price
 it makes my experience in other hotels so bad
 breakfast wasn t good paying 22 for some breakfast you could get better for 5 at a pub nearby 
 nothing
 wi if didn t work very well cot springs were broken so had to put mattress on floor because maintenance personnel had already gone home a c was not available so had to keep window open and there was a lot of noise from people pulling their suitcases over rough surfaces and talking loudly outside 
 really bad at filling up on the breakfast buffet coffee was not hot that should really count down in the review everything else was really good though 
 not uk orientated
 there wasn t anything that we didn t like about the hotel except the price it was very expensive 
 room sizes were small 
 hotel not comfort and not clean
 what i didnt like is i have booked 3 rooms with 7 adults my family and at check in time we take our laggage our self to the room but the bedest things it was in the loby at breakfast the staff was very lazy after we finsh some of our empty plates its sapot to be taken from our tables but they didnt toche any thing in our table also didnt ask us if we need any thing also i have asked for omlate egge and they ask me to pay 4 extra and my all rooms was including break fast actully this was my budest break fast after all my travells hotel in 22days at eourpe
 too far from tube stations some staff unhelpful unfriendly
 shower over bath the side of the bath was quite high to climb over 
 however the front desk staff are a little off hand and not particularly helpful even though booked through booking com hilton usually they ensure i get the loyalty bonuses free wifi etc but not the points here it was dismissed and not even addressed the hotel is relatively expensive compared with others around that offer more for less 
 long check in no gm no swimming pool no monitoring of cctv as my shoulder bag was stolen in the lobby
 staff on reception friendliness and care listening to customer requests on booking which were not taken care of 
 the room service was not great they did not clean the room well also the heating for one of our rooms was not working
 rooms need investment poor shower fixures and fittings
 i really like everything 
 the steep rise in price when we looked to book again for 14th march 
 no bath in bathroom 
 the view 
 the bathroom was quite small
 could have done with extra pillows tea coffee making facilities would have been nice 
 outdated rooms 
 very compact
 room had some bruises that i think should be fixed before letting guests in 50 in city tax came as a surprise when checking out 
 it would be better if some of the staff were locals to the country 
 nothing
 room was small
 very noisy
 the room was a bit crude unfinished no moulding chipped paint air conditioning didn t work the bed sits on the floor rather than a bed frame 
 the half door on the bathroom toilet doesn t provide much privacy for those people who prefer to keep such things private from their other half the bar is a little too large and quiet 
 the room was so small and hot definitely need to upgrade the air con systems or reduce room rate absolutely tiny 
 nothing
 the room was a bit hot but the porter came and opened a window at 4 15 
 should have book to stay longer than a day 
 strange open plan bath room facilities
 didn t like that they charged twice for the pre authorisation and it s still reflecting in my bank account now
 the rules of the hotel dictate that all amount cost is payable in advance just upon arrival at the hotel unacceptable 
 there was nothing i didn t like about this hotel i would highly recommend it and would return again
 i think the breakfast should be included in the price for the room as the price for english breakfast is extortionate 20 
 very small rooms bathrooms not as fancy as shown on website very small and very very small shower bad beds
 liked everything such lovely staff too 
 nothing
 3 remarks 1 the wifi is not strong enough to stream videos 2 the bath is not equipped to take a shower the glass screen is way too small and does not seal against the wall basically this is a bath only bathroom however now many travelers prefer to take a shower because it is faster it won t be hard to install a proper shower curtain and it will make the stay much more comfortable for many travelers 3 for a 4 star hotel too much noise from the hallway it would help to install another door between the entryway and the bedroom 
 parking is a disaster no chance to park in the hotel parking unless you have a bicycle
 minor issues lobby stafffs were little bit strange may be a cultural difference for example they made a mistake regarding my payment which after my persistent requests they verified and corrected but they never apologized internet speed is on slower side
 showering was a nightmare cold water every morning 
 the room although well appointed was compact breakfast was good 
 wi fi connection was not great
 used the one chair for night stand not too comfortable
 no hot drinks available in the room 
 shower in toilet 
 bathroom could have been cleaner room was on the frontside was kind of noisy
 no tea and coffee maker tea or coffee from the machine in the lobby was charged full restaurant price 
 terrible soundproofing of the room you can hear all night the bathroom water from the neighbour rooms when somebody closed the door in the room next to us the entire wall and the bed moved we were very surprised to find this in a 4 star hotel 
 we were not impressed by the restaurant 
 our room was a little small the wardrobe was in an annoying place on our return we will book a bigger room 
 couldn t switch off ac heating reading lights by bed hanging off no room service friday night even though was listed as 24hour
 location is great but located in an area where at night it gets a bit interesting if you have kids with you and you are coming back to the hotel after dark you may have to answer a question or two about who those ladies are on the street and why they are so friendly to dad as you walk by don t get me wrong we never felt unsafe though any time day or night in the hotel or around the area of the hotel and actually it made for a good laugh or two folks it s paris at night you know that going in so deal with it my only suggestion for the hotel itself is to add an ice machine and ice buckets to the hotel or put small fridge in each room from that one sentence you know i m american i can t help it i like an ice machine bottom line is it is a great place to stay for the price and yes we would stay there again 
 the room was quite small for a four member family it would be better to choose two double rooms 
 the stairs
 the hotel does not meet all 5 star criterias the windows are all very old and has to be changed the bathroom window must be 30 years old and did not close but this is in no way to say the hotel is bad it just has few things to be adjusted and we did enjoy our stay 
 the hotel is very old the rooms and the furniture and there was only one lift in the hotel
 well i had a room on the ground floor with no window for me it was good but my spouse felt discomfort another issue is not everybody speaks englisch on the reception but they are so nice that you will understand them anyway 
 the room was tiny
 the color red everywhere 
 every thing good
 the hotel is not 4 hotel maximum 3
 arrived a bit early and room wasn t ready came back when told to and still it wasn t ready asked if they would call us when it s ready and they agreed we waited another hour no call and so just tried again and finally we were checked in not a great start to your trip when you re tired from traveling 
 no 3rd bed ready in arrival nor an extra mug for tea
 everything was awful 
 door re bathroom
 room was very noisy from clanking of steam pipes
 i was locked inside the elevator for 10 minutes until they could fix it
 noisy air con breakfast buffet a bit of a shambles very slow to refill items 
 the location is a bit of a walk from town some of the staff members were disinterested and unhelpful the pool is tiny so don t let the photos fool you there is no kettle or coffee available in the room 
 bathrooms need updating extension numbers need to be available on the phone for services e g reception which we didn t have we needed an iron and we couldn t get through to anyone luckily reception called to see if we were ok at that moment i asked for the iron although staff were friendly breakfast finishes too early decor needs updating 
 it was all good 
 would love a safe 
 when i reached and entered to the hotel small bathroom shampoos were missing and empty internal shampoo box was empty either it is unacceptabke for this kind of luxury hotel 
 house keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate
 the room had very little lighting it was quite a dull room to wake up in especially since the window was facing into another window with no natural lighting it made the lighting in the room even worse 
 cocktails at the sky lounge were very expensive 
 breakfast we paid extra for breakfast when we went to eat the queue was so long we didn t have time so asked for our money back they kindly seated us in the club lounge for breakfast instead but the egg bacon tomato and mushrooms were stone cold and inedible there was no toast and choices not great no time to complain as by the time we d done all of that we had to leave also two receptionists one male and one female were lovely but another female receptionist was not friendly at all and not what i would expect from front of house staff 
 very bad wifi in my room 
 bed was quite firm lift used by workmen and deliveries when there is a work lift available milk for coffee rather than cream would be preferred 
 no faults
 they gave me a room that wasn t clean still had someone else s toiletries in there then they gave me another room after i refused to go back to that one which was smaller and had a stain on the bedspread do not be fooled by the pictures you see on their page the hotel is quite old from what i could tell 
 the only rooms with two beds are right by the lift so we had a lot of noise from returning royal albert concert goers 
 very noisy outside in early hours of morning 
 bit far from centre tram onlu goes until 12 midnight
 smell of sewer in the room they didn t change bed sheets not once in four days you have to pay extra for wi fi transparent door on the bathroom
 l isolation phonique
 the room is smaller than i imagined there s no space can open one 29 luggage also can t believe a famous chain of hotel has no the safe in the room 
 difficulty checking in no iron in room when provided with iron it tripped the electrics
 nothing
 a bit far from central 
 super small room no minibar in the room small beds
 no
 breakfast overpriced 
 upon arrival the staff were very ignorant as i m young i felt like they didn t want me there which is not acceptable as i m paying as much as any customer 
 some of the staff are nice but some are very cold i don t like the fact we can t keep our room key and the staff have to verify you each time you ask for the key 
 i had some bug biting spots when i left i wonder which bugs there were 
 smoke alarm went off several mornings very early lobby could use a refresh
 the room is too small no sound proof too noisy drinking water is not available one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in 
 you hear every word of the people next door if those were party peiple you will not sleep
 the staff rudely disputed my booking when i was given a double bed rather than a twin room which was on my booking and a particular member of staff held this against me on top of this the breakfasts hot food cost 25 each rip off for what you get 
 bathroom was well set out but slightly cramped 
 location was good 
 we couldn t stay any longer 
 everyt but the room was a bit all for that price
 the breakfast was 18 euros per person per day very expensive we did not eat the breakfast 
 room for couple are little bit small but worth every penny
 there was a mouse in the bar 
 no fresh orange juice red orange juice does not make me feel special proper english tea 
 poor sound protection between rooms bathrooms in need of refurbishment 
 this is a 3 star hotel not a 4 star one ac was not working well in the room complained couple of times but it was not fixed internet was not working during the two days while there overall it was not s great choice 
 breakfast
 the exterior and the interior of the hotel looked very shabby 
 n a
 old very noisy airconditioning system and very small room no hotel parking 
 i thought the breakfast was very expensive compared to other similar hotels
 free wifi is slow i think it should be improved a bit 
 breakfast variety was not enought
 nothing
 1 the front entrance needs a really good clean up smoke pervades the atmosphere around doors urine stains on front steps not washed in our four night stay needs a good high pressure washer 2 concierge refused to book us a restaurant one evening 3faulty bedlamp only fixed after 3 complaints 4 consumables in room not replenished 5no bottle opener in room 6 security only beefed up after a conference started none on our arrival 
 no separate shower only one over the bath quilt not big enough for the bed 
 i have no comments for this box 
 service is well below standard 4 hours for luggage to be delivered and then got annoyed when i went to get it myself have stayed here before and service continues to slide may not stay again
 it was not value for money 
 more space
 not enough storage space for clothes
 price please let me save money hahaha
 couldn t get the wifi to work 
 room was small which is okay for overnight stay or longer if you are on your own but not as a couple 
 crazy in a new room truly nowhere to place and open your luggage no luggage rack whatsoever so had to open my cases on the floor cold wooden floor no throw away slippers provided enough tea and coffee in the room but not enough milk 
 wifi was slow to the point of being unusable 
 really far from the city center
 i had a very early flight and could not get a coffee at reception despite the presence of a functioning nespresso machine according to receptionist he is not allowed to sell coffee before 7 am 
 size of the bathroom
 small room as usual in london little more room than what is occupied by the bed 
 soundproof could be better
 nothing all good
 not a thing
 loved it all
 room has no window
 would have liked feather pillows
 in room menu far too expensive for what it is 8p for porridge no thanks more diversity in menu appreciated too 
 shower sprinkler is not working well awkward to use 
 bathroom shower was filthy lamps on the sealing were very poorly installed holes were too big for the lamps and they were very untidy fridge in the room made very loud noise every 20 30seconds so it wasn t so easy to get to sleep at sunday evening at 10pm someone came to knock all the doors to collect used bottles he called himself as the roomservice housekeeping came one day at 5pm to ask if we wanted to get our room cleaned cleaning times were not at same time every day last day when our check out time was at 12pm the housekeeping showed up at 10am to clean up our room 
 everything was great 
 they never cleaned the room and didn t changed the bed 
 it was very warm so air conditioning was the problem fans were supplied so it was something
 they should have cheaper prices for the lower floor rooms you can t pay the same price with the other rooms the room was not at all sound proof you could hear each time someone flushes the toilet and could hear footsteps and noise from the corridor overall what i like to have is customer service and people friendly and smiling and eager to assist you instead i had icy cold behavior so i wouldn t book there in the future 
 dangerously narrow bath under shower tv reception was poor noise of people walking about in room above eur18 breakfast was sub par for this class of hotel 
 nothing at all 
 pool ideal for quick dip but the rubber flooring was a bit smelly musty damp smell also check out bill had 4 mini bar charge but we hadn t had anything we didn t reprt this due to it being a small amount and the queue at reception still annoying 
 nik
 the bathroom door made of opaque glass had a problem it didn t stay closed there wasn t any locking system and 3 4 seconds after closing it the door was starting to slowly open we had to use a towel to keep it close wile using the bathroom also the shower sewage was noisy we could hear the water flowing every time the shower was used in the neighbor s room 
 beds were a wee bit firm for our liking and only one spare pillow and a single bath towel both rectified on asking bar was a little pricey but i guess you expect that in a hotel lots of good chinese restaurants in immediate area but you will need to go further if you want italian the immediate area is a bit of a rabbit warren and easy to get lost in the streets make sure you have a map either electronic or paper 
 the view from the bedroom was of dixons carphone wear house however it was only for one night and didn t spend much time in the hotel
 the hotel really needs updating the room was shabby the bed was only a small double had the exec suite more like a standard double would not stay here again
 all rooms were double bed rooms no twin beds were available
 the rooms were a little tired the lighting on the bathroom was poor and the bathroom too small
 we called down to book a table at the restaurant on sunday after we came down dressed we were told the restaurant is closed we had to find a alternate location at around 9 30pm which was not ideal 
 u have to pay for room wifi abd the are no complementary water
 would of been nice to have bottled water in room
 escalators to reception would have rathered reception on ground floor 
 the hotel is very far from the center during rainy days there is no taxi coming so we were blocked one evening at the hotel 
 a bit worn in some parts 
 nothing bad 
 the only drawback is the noise you can hear almost everything from the hallway 
 the price
 quite small room but it was very clean cozy with fully renovated since i fully understand how expensive to rent a house in the center of paris it was satisfied
 without parking
 could have done with air conditioning but it is a very old hotel so i understand why this is not available 
 a bit more expensive than i would have liked for the room but cheap and cheerful compared to inner milan prices 
 location is bad without a car but you mostly welcome to take bus and go to the end station san siro stadium and than reach zara or centrale route to the city center will take you 35 40 minute 
 pillows and mattress they were so bad i wasn t able to sleep both the nights and my shoulder and back started to pain pls do sthing about it 
 room too small for 4 people we needed to ask every time for more towels because we were 4 and they only put 2 sets 
 there isn t anything i would improve it was perfect 
 i dont like the brakefast at all the elevators are so slow
 waiting for the lift was a real pain it often took five minutes or more to arrive and by then it was full 
 no aircon equals no sleep bed was tiny and for an upgraded room it was so small this was nowhere near the standard of other evenly priced rooms i think you need to look at the sister company s in hong kong they have been amazing you guys really need to update that place asap we will not be returning and advised others not to as well last year we where in the hilton and it was fantastic 
 bathroom was filthy
 the staff is very rude and the room is very small 
 not much just small issues no shower door or curtain so bathroom floor gets very wet 
 there was nothing to dislike at all
 staff forgot to leave the complimentary birthday card for my husband in the room and the birthday plate with a chocolate message that we had been in email contact about the moment was lost which was a disappointment for him and me 
 no powerpoints anywhere near a standing position in front of a mirror to plug in hairdryer hair dryer cord so short that i could not actually blowdry my hair anywhere near a mirror universal theme in every european hotel i ever stay in but with a brand new refurb i always wonder how this gets overlooked every single time incredibly irritating whether travelling for business or leisure 
 not enough tea and coffee left in room the bath could have been longer not suitable for tall people and not much space in shower 
 this is the second time we booked at the hotel last year we had a very good experience with our accommodation and we decided to book the same hotel for this year trip it was a huge disappointment for us the elevator was out of order for all the 6 days that we were there the towels were dirty the cups for the coffee they were dirty too and i also asked for clean ones the toilet wasn t flush and they send someone from the staff to fix it as soon as we arrived one night around midnight there was a false alarm in the hotel and we had to run out of the hotel with our pajamas while we were sleeping last but not least the day we left we asked the hotel to book a taxi for us we told them we need a taxi that accept visas since we run out of cash they called a taxi and the taxi didn t accept visas when we told to the taxi driver can you please take as to an atm he denied and he said he don t have time to look for an atm so he stop the car while he was driving and he asked my husband to go out and go find an atm before he take us to the bus stop where the bus was waiting for us to take us to the airport my husband went out of the car he found an atm he had money and we paid him in order to take us to our destination when we arrived he didn t even give us a hand with the luggages and he charged us 22 pounds instead of 6 pounds that we paid last year and of what we used to paid almost everyday during our stay there the hotel was very irresponsible with this and made us feel very uncomfortable and almost miss the bus to airport due to the fact that they didn t care about our request i am very disappointed and i don t know if i will be able to consider visiting the hotel again 
 cold rooms central system is turned off during the night we were with small baby must be renew interior in the room 
 they didn t provide sleeper on the rooms 
 the loading of laundry into a truck was done at one in the morning which was very disturbing with all the shouting and noises by the van staff probably not under control by the hotel but still annoying
 the way they treat the costumer wale the a c damage
 i expected more bathroom equipment for example make up remover hand cream etc and two tooth glasses as it was a double room which are usually can be found in five stars hotel 
 concierge did not offer to carry single ladies bag strange 
 becareful with this hotel i have stayed there between 29th sep til 2 st october i was with my wife my 5 years old daughter was in turkey so she had high fever then we need to return 1 day ago i have spoken with booking com they have spoken with hotel and they said it need to be 24 in advance then nothing to do my daugter is more important then money so at14 10 i went to loby on 1st of octeber to check out so they said you need to speek with booking com to cancel your stay i call them and they again call hotel and they said this time it is 14 15 so you are 15 minutes late so we charge you full still my daugter is much more important then this hotel payment another issue hotel price was 450 gbp and they authorise 520 gbp which is normal but when i check out they take my credit card and take 450 gbp it looks normal but still my 520 gbp authorisation is not released i talk with hotel and they said it is normal this means i pay 450 gbp and also they authorise 520 gbp i am stil waiting for cancelation 
 too small bedroom
 difficult to call the lifts very slow
 the soap dispensers in the shower were broken the reservation said slippers and robes there were not any i had to seek out toilet paper in the bathroom cabinet there was a pair of manky earrings in there the mini bar was a nice touch except it was regular coke rather than diet coke 
 undergoing a full revamp so some disruptions didn t really impact our stay but be aware if you are booking they have limited the work to sociable hours so no work starts before 10am 
 the only negative comment is that the wifi connection was very poor 
 sometime so crowded near the hotel
 it needs a total upgrade it wad not as clean as expected 
 noise from city link train
 heating system was awful we had two rooms room 1 was freezing despite on max heat room 2 was so hot despite on max cold no ventilation in a room so had to keep it on running max cold during all night to just manage but the noise was awful to sleep 
 getting to the property was a nightmare beyond traffic the entrance is only accessed through the bus taxi lane which goes the opposite direction to the one way street parking was quite a distance and not connected with the hotel no valet 
 staff was not very nice and quite far from the centre
 the free internet is unreasonably slow and only sufficient for basic emailing a major improvement seems possible at minimal cost 
 paper cups in room
 decor in the room could be refreshed
 the mattresses may be coming to the end of their natural lives 
 we were given a room on the basement floor and it was the worst hotel experience in my life the cell phone signal tended to die out a lot in the room i had to constantly go to the ground floor to make phone calls the wi fi didn t work 90 percent of the time and when it did work it was only for a minute or two due to the room being basically underground it was constantly dark and the lamps didn t give sufficient light the constant semi darkness was extremely depressing to be fair there was a window in the room but it overlooked some rubbish bins or something like that in a basement and there were constantly people poking around those bins so we had to keep the curtains closed which again led to the problem of not enough light and the absolutely worst thing is that either the guests or the stuff of the hotel used this corner of the basement as a place for smoking and we constantly had the terrible smell of smoke all over our room my mother having asthma had to double her inhaler usage and i had to take anti allergy pills 
 doors in bathroom so heavy
 wanted an iron they said let us see if can manage one for you didnt like it
 room 202 ridiculously noisy room unbearable temperature to sleep and air con was to loud and dusty to have on newspapers were a day old staff behind reception rude tea pots smelt making tea taste funny and we received a wake up call at 7 30am when we didn t request one massive room for improvements considering location and cost shower head lose and electric sockets falling off the wall also 
 expensive for this type of boutique hotel 
 price
 the location it was in a very dodgy area of lambeth i had to look over my shoulder 
 average hotel small room nothing like the pictures i suppose you get what you pay for 
 the position of the hotel was not clearly marked and when we asked for directions many didn t even hear about it 
 the best question in context of my stay would be was the hotel value for money unfortunately the answer is no from the beginning to the end i was disappointed i location was good due to connectivity to the other areas by public transport bus stop public transport airport buses and tourist buses were less than 2 mins away and metro station was also close by but the good things ended here for me wifi was sub standard no electric kettle in the room room was small and many more issues would like to make a special mention of an episode i am from dubai and hence needed an adapter to connect my chargers and other devices to the european plug points i asked for them in the reception from my room s intercom inspite of being tired after a 12 hrs flight and after paying hefty room charge i was told to come down to the reception to take it i went down and to my surprise i was given a box with some usb cables and other useless cables to choose from and when i complained about it they said its not available and gave me the address of a supermarket to buy the stuff this was a turnoff of me within minutes of entry to the hotel this is just one of the several disappointing incidents that took place in short i would like to say highly overpriced minimal facilities no room service and arrogant staff i would have got better hotels at better locations at better price 
 no negative comments 
 the staff all appeared to have just started working in hospitality there was no attention to detail it s not that they were rude just undertrained especially breakfast service 
 no locks in bathroom doors no conditioners to found only shower gel and shampoo i even ask the staff for toothbrush and toothpaste and ask me if i didnt brought one with me 
 expensive for a rather moderate place
 nothing 
 nothing to dislike 
 design won out over function drinks list gold lettering on black low level lighting an iphone torch moment
 drains in bathroom emit a light pong
 value to price was out of balance
 thin walls could hear a guy snoring in the room above kept me awake 
 cooked breakfast is extra but there many coffee shops and pubs such as the troubadour that do great breakfasts
 leisure club very tired and dated
 on a hot day there is need for more ventilation the windows are on restrictors air con would have been nice although a fan was provided
 fairly laid back
 breakfast was awful barely warm tinned mushrooms the sausages were hardly cooked and no choice of egg for the price you charge i would expect fresh hot food in the morning the electrics in our room stopped working we had to go to another room to use our hair dryer this made us later than we would have liked to have been to check out 
 cleanliness of the room our toilet seat was broken when we arrived and wasn t fixed
 breakfast could have been better more en channels on tv you have to call the front desk to get your room temperature changed 
 nothing particular
 there was nothing to comment badly about everything was excellent
 break fast not included
 can t think of a thing
 they pre authorise payment card and also take payment so you have 185 held for 5 days and the 185 payment taken so a 370
 staff were rude laughed down the phone to me when i asked for a iron maid left dirty cleaning rags in our bathroom towels were tatty need new ones 
 they could charge for the room correctly we were charged twice the breakfast is terrible cindered bacon and everything else was cold there was a noisy duct outside our room that went boom every now and then the beds were uncomfortable booked a double and got twin the check in was chaos the staff are arrogant when we told them about the error on charging the credit card we were told that was good 
 the room are small the bath too
 nothing
 nothing 
 room was very small and in need of renovations paid 5 star price for a 2 star room 
 ate in bar area and food was average 
 bathroom a little bit old fashioned 
 can t connnect to wifi very disappointed
 the decor was a bit daggy but we liked that
 horrible rooms dirty
 expensive for worn shabby room that wasn t 100 clean and had a huge pillar in the middle of the room 
 i did not like the 30 per day hold on the credit card for extras three days later this has still not been returned to my card balance
 great hotel but was over priced as the food on the night shift was awful and very cheap tasting but cost a fortune their could of been more food and drinks in the room for the price we paid
 bathroom was more of a pod in the room fine for us as we re reasonably young and married but a bit personal for older ppl or those not in a relationship 
 nothing
 the reception was antipatic they heart my wife that couldn t speak withthem breakfast is terrible wifi is not easy to get you need crew help
 all good
 the room that i stayed in had no to little mobile signal
 room is a little small but that s what s paris 
 nothing to unlike as a 4 star europen city hotel its ok
 was travelling with 2 large cases for work just took a little longer to bring my cases up and down the stairs but managed 
 mess upon arrival with parking and running out of breakfast
 difficult to sleep due to mechanical noise outside g01 room torn carpet 
 nothing 
 a slightly bigger sink area would have been nice
 bin in bathroom hadn t been emptied on arrival terrible coffee and tea at breakfast 
 nothing 
 noise on lower level floor woke me up several times lift too small shower needs updating
 the bar was shut at 10 30 but the staff enabled us to get a drink to take to the room why did a london hotel bar shut so early 
 rooms ensuites are ridiculously small my partner who is 5 10 couldn t fit his head under the shower head we had to get moved we went for breakfast both mornings 20 mins before closing time and we were made feel like a nuisance by rude serving staff no residents bar on sunday night lifts all over the place hard to find to 7th floor very disappointed for money we spent 
 there should be proper fridges in the room we had one that rather gave off heat than cool but was very kindly replaced on our first day however was just as useless as the previous one we have been advised that these are not fridges but rather keep cool boxes so we were stuck with that this was only really a problem for us because we needed to cool our son s milk 1 5 year old the pool is very small and hasn t got many loungers they were all occupied whenever we attempted to go down there so ended up not being able to use the pool
 breakfast was limited and furniture dated rooms not as advertised
 room was miles away from lift
 only gripe the hotel should have an option of twin beds it is especially difficult to get out of the xlarge enclosed on 3 sides bed if both persons are disabled 
 restaurants lounge food is less than average and limited rooms are small and very basic like an average off road motel 
 not a thing
 maintenance issue reported at 7 am on way to breakfast returned to room 8 am and not dealt with told on check out maintenance issues only dealt with after 8 am 
 small room but to be expected really in a city our first room was very noisy and the shower flooded the bathroom but we were moved with no problems after 1 night 
 the spa was very disappointing the pool was to cold the sauna didn t work and the turkish bath was far to hot ittook your breath away very hazordous no proper lighting couldn t see if you were partially sighted you would have had a problem it reminded me of somewhat seedy i think it was to give a sensual overtime but it wasn t c that impression the spa was a very hazordous area bathroom was a nightmare you had to be a cortonoist to have a shower it was very slippery the floor was dangerous when i got out bed i nearly slipped one lift didn t work and the room was sombre couldn t make tea or coffee in the room very inconvient staff were great and very helpful great they were but the concept of the hotel was designer but not at all practical and that was big factor in the stay i was concerned that i had to be aware of the hazards it s totally dysfunctional for staying anylonger than a couple of days it doesn t work for the client but works for the staff who maintain the hotel 
 taking a flight of steps to reception 
 the attitude of the receptionist is bad when check out just need change the receipt title name 25th jul morning 
 looked onto a building site room quite small
 the main lights in the room were a bit dim but there were lots of lamps not much variety at breakfast with the hot food the view wasn t amazing but not at all overlooked
 no hairdryer or shower cap in the room tv didn t work properly
 no problem at all 
 the hotel is old and would need refurbishment the carpet everywhere in the room and curtains do not give a feeling of cleanliness for the price and announced standing service is poor caf is lyophilis basic shampoo no body cream television was ridiculously old and small and all the programs apart from the french one were blurred 
 very late check in 
 expensive extras valet laundry etc and room service taking cleaning things that were not always required to be taken cleaned
 can t think of a thing 
 location almost outside the town and the charges for parking 
 very hot night air conditioning units began to rattle badly at about 2 30 am so loud sleep impossible in desperation we rang down to reception who moved us to a different room this was even worse the room was on floor m had no secondary glazing and the traffic noise was appalling we hated it so much we checked out a 4am there being no point in staying longer since neither of us could sleep a shame we were celebrating a birthday
 nothing i can think of 
 the walls are thin one can hear people talking in the room nextdoor
 it has a small door enterance
 be careful in summer cosy victorian style without air condition 
 the first room we got was very small but the staff was very friendly and quickly got us a bigger room 
 the hotel request full payment before checking in which was a problem for me as the hotel was booked with company s credit card which is not registered under my name had to wait until late in the evening when my colleague rush to the hotel after he got off work really loud noise on the balcony for fire escape one night at 11pm was sleeping but awakened by the noise the walls are quite thin on this side not a good sleep that night no heating available in oct 
 the room was so hot and air conditioning didn t appear to be working also noise buzzing in bathroom disturbing
 nothing
 i paid for an executive room and although it had been very newly refurbished and was a nice room the decor it was the standard size room that i feel you would get at any other hotel and did not feel like an executive room and cost 250 per night saying this the staff were so helpful smiley and pleasant that it did make it worth the money 
 asked for a taxi to gare lyon instead got us a lovely driver but it was 109 euros yikes
 not enough staff and lack of parking small shower
 we asked a member of staff if they could let one of the other gusts know we were at the bar and instead of him going to reception to do this for us he said we had to go ourselves i felt they did not to the basic good customer service let alone go the extra mile 
 we took 3 equal rooms but any of them were equal one too small the other bigger and one of them it was really noisy at night so it was difficult to sleep we asked for something nicy in my mum s room because it was her birthday and they just left a piece of chocolate in her room 
 the prices at the bar were steep but compared to the other city centre bars it wasn t too bad especially considering there wasn t much choice in the local area it didn t put us off going back at all 
 the room small size my room was 26 need to arrange in way that can be more big
 room wasn t completely clean sockets and tv didn t work got a very good compensation though 
 this hotel is rated 4star where it could be max 2star
 i confirmed the arrival at 2am via booking com e mail as this hotel has a 24 hour reception upon arrival i was informed that my reservation was cancelled due to their policy of cancelling if a guest doesn t show up until 6pm that wasn t mentioned anywhere and is directly opposite of what was agreed with the staff so i had to pay directly to the hotel and not via booking com whatsoever which costed me 50 eur more than what it should have costed 200 vs 150 eur as a sign of their hospitality they upgraded the room to a better one comfort deluxe room what can you do at 2am but accept the terms of the hotel which purposely avoided booking com rules with a made up story 
 air conditioning was out room temp was over 30
 breakfast ist just ok
 small dingy room
 some components of the breakfast buffet don t match the four star status
 service at breakfast two out of four mornings no cups when asked the staff replied didn t have any roof top terrace waste of time 1 night closed one night no barman had to buy drinks downstairs and carry them up eight floors one night barman covering room service and we had to ring reception to be served approx 20 minutes each time last night cycling function till after 22 00 the amount we paid did not reflect in the facilities service and overall standard of hotel expected a lot more 
 it should be more big
 room slighty small kept getting in each others way when getting ready to go out 
 the homeless element was in your face world wide issue their personal toilet habits was the issue to step around not nice but not the hotel s fault
 lightening in the room could be radier to manage and cosier
 the bed has basically the system of a sofa bed not the usual ramada quality you should get 
 the hallway carpet smelled dusty the extracter fan in the bathroom didnt work we requested a triple room and were given a double and then another bed was fitted that was very uncomfortable not the best experience considering hilton hotels are normally much better 
 nothing
 there were 2 beds in the room however we got the distinct feeling we weren t meant to use both just a minor point and didn t impact on the stay which was superb 
 the rooms are very small
 there are a lot missing things
 a bit far from center of amsterdam
 indoor pool was under reconstruction when making reservation this information was not available 
 air condition was not working probably but we opened window and it was ok 
 the room was so small for two people my husband and i had to pivot around the room very dark insufficient light no storage for suitcases bathroom so small no place where to put cosmetics mine were on the window sill 
 room was very small incredible 
 rubbish breakfast poor selection had to pay extra for eggs and some salmon 7 salmon 12 for 3 eggs ridiculously rubbish continental didn t want any of it they also took another holding deposit of 100 didn t tell me still haven t put money back in account despite paying cash and advising i ll pay cash on entry no notice of holding more money in bank very poor ordered tea to the room hour and a half went by rang up obviously forgot and did it again 
 tea and coffee facilities in room
 staff in breakfast restaurant without smile
 none
 room was warm at night
 windows are too small and can t be opened more than 10 cm price is quite high
 to be totally honest there was nothing not to like 
 soft drinks where priced quite high
 poor quality of the room for the price paid booked a suite with a rambla view the wash hand basin had a large crack in it the wardrobe door didn t close correctly the tv in the bedroom didn t work properly and although there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room teabags coffee sachets there was no milk went to the supermarket across the road for it the breakfast although it looked appetising did not taste the same doesn t rate 4 stars to me i have stayed in better 3 star hotels in barcelona
 beds were uncomfortable and there was strong smell of cigarette smoke in bathroom this was dealt with by the last night of our stay 
 the bed was a little too firm 
 far from city center
 it was dirty dust everywhere and it smells like something has died we had to change hotel and booking com was not helpful
 single room was small on enquiringly about staying a second night the same room would cost 270 
 the drawers in the side table were not cleaned out well i found a food wrapper and brochures in one of them the shuttle service partner used by the hotel he fell asleep multiple times while driving a van full of 6 tourists to the airport we could see him dozing off from the rear view mirror horrifying take the rer or a taxi 
 had to open window at night as a bit hot but really not much of an issue
 too far out of town
 the room was too hot
 if you are looking for a true 5 star facility besides the service this may not be it the hotel is pretty old and you can totally see the wear and tear of the rooms 
 nothing to say
 breakfast very expensive if like me you only take coffee and toast
 the cost of the restaurant not a lot of restaurants within walking distance 
 the room was dusty in places and the glasses were dirty the shower water went everywhere which was dangerous for me and my partner the view was a disappointment considering the amount of money i paid for the reservation room the reason i booked the hotel was for the view advertised on the website very unsatified with my stay i ve stayed in cardiff park plaza and it was unbelievablely clean and worth the money 
 dark corridors and signage could be more prominent
 renovation works were so noisy the workers noise and what they did starts before 8 a m daily the last 4 days they put electrical generator working the whole day it was very annoying 
 nothing to dislike
 falta de bussines center
 bit small
 room decor was so bad window was tiny and blocked w all kind of interior no hot water in the morning and plumper enter the room rite after knock not even wait for response isolation was so bad icould heart noises from people walking on heels upstair and ventilation machine and they charged full price with a unsincere sorry after hearing the complain 
 room servaies
 the fact that i upgraded for a balcony and was really small the mattress
 the wifi signal was very bad and the room was too tight 
 nothing springs to mind 
 somewhere to put the used tea bags we had to use bits of paper and sandwich wrappers to stop the old tea bags marking the spotless rubbish bins a plastic bag would have been good just a minor thing but still an irritant 
 saucer used as ashtray by previous guests on window sill outside the room leaking kettle rickety taps in bathroom found bug in bed carpets in corridors frayed rundown feel to hotel throughout 
 layout of the toilet when sharing with kids
 a bit strange to not have a window the fully transparent wall next to the door there was a heavy curtain though
 nothing everything was great 
 we were originally given a room that was quite small however the staff very kindly accepted to give us a different room which was very nice so in the same price range you could get a small or bigger room we would advise that the smaller rooms are advertised and charged as such e g small double room so that visitors know when booking 
 this is a 2 star hotel 
 nothing really but some might find the lobby area rather busy at night
 the elevetorss were slow
 the room was so hot we didnt sleep there was no way to turn it down i dont understand why they have it so hot as everyone complaining shame as everything else was good 
 very bad internet coverage
 no free biscuits with the free coffee in bedrooms
 sound proof is just bad hotel personal had loud conversations in the mornings it s not a problem for those who wake up at 7 am but for me it was annoying i wanted to sleep till 9 am couple times but they woke me up 
 pay to use the gym also room very small
 the cooked food for breakfast was just average no presentation some days staff were inattentive disorganised other days it was good no stand outs though which you expect in hospitality 
 we get connecting door room and that s dirtubing due to no soundproof
 filtered my search for hotels with shuttle service to the airport and selected this property purely on that at check in i was informed that the hotel didn t offer this service and that a taxi would have costed me 50 euros staff was unhelpful and i checked out a couple of hours later payed the full amount anyway 
 i booked my hotel the day before and once i arrived the room was not available due to no hot water in the hotel so i had to relocate to another hotel for one night and my room was smaller that what i paid for luckily they offered free breakfast but still disappointed about the inconvenience 
 we got a noisy room because of work in the hotel but after we complained we got a quiet room
 nothing great hotel to stay 
 could have done with a blanket in the room for the bed as it was a little cool overnight 
 wooden shutters blocked out half the daylight making room dull toaster too old and had to go through 3 times plate warmer was seriously hot
 the rooms were very small the view was disastrous from 7 am till 9 pm you can hear announcements made from the station very annoying 
 very posh felt judged by whoever checked me and my girlfriend in lgbt everyone and everything else was lovely pillows weren t that comfortable 
 more lighting options in room would be good
 the breakfast was cold and very limited choice 
 sometimes slow service
 the room unfortunately was way below my expectations considering the price and the star rating wi fi very bad
 we could not get service in the seating area outside the bar we tried to order hot drinks before bed but nobody seemed to care 
 the room was old and shabby looking the carpet was stained and worn looking some stray hairs in bathroom on arrival so not cleaned properly over priced as could have booked five star at dam square for 300 less than we paid through same company like our friends who travelled with us
 room was incredibly hot with no apparent way to control temperature we had to sleep with window open which meant we woke up at about 5 30am when traffic noise began trams were particulary loud i suspect had we not been at the front of the hotel it would have been bearable the ideal of course would be that they provided manual control for heating controlling in the room i would however stay again but ask for room at rear 
 we would have liked that there was a little bit more wariety at the breakfast table
 extra charge for breakfast with 22 seems quite high 
 the air conditioning did not work properly only worked few hours during the evening during the night and in the morning the room ad bathroom were cold even if i set the temperature at 30 only cold air came out 
 room in need of renovation update overpriced and inferior on site breakfast 
 i left my coat behind eventually gig if back but took 3 weeks and loads of telephone calls
 the room that i was in it was on the ground floor and when the curtains were open everyone would walk past and see inside the room i really didn t like that at all the bathroom was quite small and the floor was freezing in there also the car park was way too small as it took me such a long time to find a spot and park my car 
 check in was a long slow process check out was even worse 20mins one customer in front of me service in the bar was a joke it was not busy but again took a lot of waving to get served and then we were forgotten the free water in the room was not restocked over night i was left the 1 2 drunk one from my first night when i went to use the mini bar there is a note inside saying please ask for this to be stocked if you need it defeating the object at 3am when you need a cold glass of water or pop over priced hotel brand where customer service is low on the priority 
 it s a bit shabby but really this didn t matter the location couldn t have been better 
 honestly speaking everything was amazing except once i ordered food from in dining services and wasn t up to the level expectation 
 not too close to the city you need a train bus to get to the city center 
 as vegetarians we didn t find it great for food the breakfasts were very fresh with juices and fruits pastries etc but i would have preferred a better selection of veggies unfortunately the restaurant couldn t offer us anything from the tasting menu for dinner either there are plenty of veggie restaurants within walking distance so we didn t starve 
 reception area doesn t represent the hotel rooms or standard of service given
 on third floor with no lift 
 i had to ask the staff to change mattress on the bed it was unacceptable heavily used 
 had to wait for over an hour to check in had to leave our luggage with the porter as we had dinner pre booked and checked in later in the evening worst customer service ever experience never even said sorry that we had been through this experience also if you have already checked in online they dont ever go the the quick check in desk so everyone has to queue up in the same queue 
 the older beds have been replaced with firmer i e harder beds 
 price is too high
 could have had more for vegetarians e g veggie sausages poached eggs etc
 it s a huge hotel with many rooms on inner courts because of a late booking we had a room on the first floor with barely any view on the court wall and sunlight next to the maids room quite noisy unless you plan to study polish 4 star price for a one star situation check the room floor and situation if you can
 everything
 bed was not comfy both me and my wife woke with sore backs each day also a window which could open in the room would have been good the second lift being out of order the whole week 
 around 50overpriced for the area and size of room 
 staff at bar ignored us 
 bit hot in the room
 couldn t eat cookie nuts were involved
 staff were inconsistent reception lady at check out was not at all warm or friendly so different to the guy i had checking in and no free water each small bottle was 6 euros 
 there is a spiral staircase in case those who dislike lifts elevators can access the six floors the lighting needs to be improved as the stair treads have a black surface 
 the lift tiny quite scary and often not working and the stairs are very steep 
 spa was poor and not very user friendly
 nothing
 no breakfast included there was a used coffee cup and spoon in the room when we arrived found the aircon a bit difficult to regulate the room temp effectively unit was also a little noisy to leave on overnight 
 the room dining was not good at all it was a disappointment 
 the staff in the reception treat us badly and when i arrived i only get my room ready at 5 00 pm which is very late to rest even they took 300 pounds and still i didn t get refund that because some receptionists took from my cards more money than required that is the worse hotel in london 
 queue at check in and flimsy frosted glass door on bathroom not sufficiently private for twin room
 the windows do not offer enough soundproofing but maybe i m just too sensitive to sounds it is the case with many many hotels 
 staff attitude and helpless not professional dealers
 the recommended canal bus which they sell tickets for and it was not the best value for the money or time the hotel restaurant and bar i would give 3 but there are excellent restaurants nearby 
 wifi is not good small single room just about 6m2 including tiny shower room 
 heating in the room did not work well nightclub across the water goes on until late morning 
 small rooms no bath small bed
 i paid for a 4 stars hotel the hotel deserves 3 stars maximum here s what i saw there old building old and slow elevator the shower has a small head but was okay bathroom was poor air conditioning was very difficult to adjust when you walk on the floor it makes noise they didn t provide tissues and toilet papers unless we ask for it free water just for the first day small mini bottles should be for all the days the reception i called them around 10 times they picked up twice when i complained about the issues i m facing the front desk manager rude and not even wearing a name badge told me if you don t like our hotel you can leave it and you shouldn t compare it to hotels in europe someone remind me where is spain he didn t even try to satisfy me way too too expensive poor value for money i don t recommend this hotel
 booked this hotel with the prospect of rooftop access according to the website on arrival told this is only for those staying in suites very disappointing lighting in bathroom inadequate if you are a female trying to apply makeup etc not wildly keen on very dark paint on bedroom walls rather gloomy but others may like gym tiny and really only suitable for one guest at a time bar was very very gloomy due to the lighting and dark coverings on windows even on the sunniest of days it was like sitting in a blackout breakfast appallingly overpriced 
 many kinds of sweet bread were prepared on the dishes but there are few choices of breakfast menus for japanese japanese do not eat sweet bread food in the breakfast dressing for salad should be not only olive oil balsamico salt pepper but also some of tasty sauces please 
 room very ikea
 nothing
 the elevator
 studio is located on 4th floor no elevator
 cleaning rooms in the morning not much fun coming back to an unmade up room 
 quite far from the city center the entrance from the underground parking to the hotel area was a bit weird clear directions are needed and although it is understandable that not all guests opt for the breakfast menu it was very annoying to have been asked twice about my room number and if i payed for the breakfast 
 smelly toilet and noisy at the early morning
 noisy room seemed to be next to an office lots of door slamming in the morning also roadworks outside so taxis couldn t get to hotel breakfast was poor 
 breakfast toast was brought to the table before we even went up to choose breakfast so toast was cold 
 room a little small but very cosy
 the attic room 31 was far too small
 we and others got lost in trying to locate your hotel whilst exploring area suggest you provide a leaflet with map upon booking in 
 the room was very small and no draws for clothing so only the possibility to hang them i was there on bussiness and looked for a room with a desk but as it was very small in order to work needed to move the coffee machine tray and there was little space to put it on the floor
 room quite small but cosy 
 small double bed with very little room around it made cup of tea in the morning and the milk curdled un drinkable
 rooms are a bit small 
 breakfast was overcrowded no place at the bar at evenings 
 there was no cooker only a microwave 
 having to pay 100 euro per room deposit
 nothing 
 nothing everything was great 
 no wireless internet in room at our room 312 the internet very slow all areas no tea catel in the rooms bad staff behavior staff gave wrong information about prices and charged more int call an exmple plz be carful 
 service
 sofa bed was small and not very comfortable
 concierge
 carnt fault the hotel but was little disappointed that the spa an gym wasn t open yet as we booked it thinking it was open but apart from that loved everything about it will defo stay again staff was very helpfully to 
 i wanted to spend more time on the balcony but the wifi didn t reach that far and would drop out 
 telephone system door key system
 everything was fine
 no
 all was good
 the room service is overpriced a cold tiny bite size pot pie service fee is 6 50 
 nothing
 i loved everything 
 tiny room minibar fridge was nort guest friendly 
 bed was rather small for a double
 no bad experiences at all
 air condition was central and it was not that strongly working 
 very loud construction work in the station at 2am meant i had to move rooms this was well handled by the staff
 no fridge in the room the bed is clearly near the end of its useful life the room was much smaller than i expected pretty tiny especially for two people pokey gym 
 one day i catched cold water instead of hot 
 very little storage in the room 
 drinks very expensive at the bar
 rude waitress at the restaurant made our dinner very unpleasant
 not a big criticism but the room was a wee bit tired 
 the drain smell as you enter the hotel only at the entrance 
 far from metro station around 25min walk hallways smells cigarette couldnt open the windows staff opened the door right after knoking to ask us about the service quality which was kinda weird 
 having to fix the windows as was a gap at the top of the sash windows once we managed to close them it was perfect 
 only that there was insufficient tea and milk in my room and no biscuits at all provided with the refreshments not the norm for a 4 star hotel 
 that i had to leave 
 our room wasn t ready when we arrived at 13 55 after requesting an early checkin the room wasn t ready until approx 14 45 we were issued with a parking ticket at the front of the hotel we had parked there to check in and we were in a queue for a while 
 i don t think the breakfast was worth 17 euros
 liked everything apart from the bill maybe but you get what you pay for 
 we have money stolen from us in the room filed police rapport but no action on the end of the hotel to sort out the situation 
 not enough pression in the shower wifi very poor 
 could have a n espresso machine in room
 size of room in relation to the price 
 the room was small certainly not worth the money i paid and the breakfast was not good for the money either 
 my booking form confirmed a city view i was put into room 3 on the ground floor which had a window looking out onto another wall no more than 2 meters away with a view of bird droppings on the ground in between i would not have wanted to do anything other than sleep in that room with the curtains closed consequently i went out for most of the evening the room was comfortable but i was definitely tucked away into the corner and they were probably surprised that i didn t complain 
 location was a bit out of town took a long time to check in with only one receptionist no 24 hour room service no minibar stocked in room cups were not cleaned
 size of the toilet could not fill kettle had to use bottled water
 didn t like that it was a non smoking hotel rather troublesome for smokers to have to get out of hotel room to go downstairs for a smoke in the cold freezing weather hopefully the hotel can improvise on this area 
 the room is really small and the sound of lift is aloud 
 expensive and bad internet connection
 nothing 
 the coffe at breakfast was not warm enough 
 no cups at breakfast to fast in collecting dishes and half full tea cups
 there was nothing i didn t like
 not the hotels fault but the fire alarm went off at 2am and we had to evacuate the building we were quickly allowed back in once it has been confirmed it was a false alarm we had a letter of apology and a explanation drunk person breaks alarm cases was my reading of it 
 room was tiny wasn t an issue though 
 when we arrived we paid 370 cash for our 2 night stay then i was asked for my bank card and they took another 370 off the card after i already paid in cash this was very disappointing as i was limited with money in amsterdam i didn t get the money back on my card till nearly a week later 
 i didn t like that the bathroom was open to the bedroom there was just a half frosted and half see through glass separator which left little privacy this wasn t made clear on booking the room smelt of drains on arrival and smelt the same around the hotel in some areas including the foyer and corridoors 
 too many dodgy characters hanging around outside 
 every time connect wifi 
 room too small not enough wardrobe space and shower too small shoddy decor no aircon and supplied fan very noisy 
 rooms not facing street look to back alley and backs of old buildings one of our rooms had funky location down steps off the main hallway very small bathroom 
 internet is pathetic after check out if you have to wait in foyer not much in the way of seating available 
 car parking not so good
 e
 air conditioning was not working and ground floor room it was suffocating 
 price but of course the place the hotel is and how is kept it would be impossible to be lower anyway i would say that price performance was good the good things are much higher than just price 
 location
 noise room size for the money paid misleading information on the rooms for a double bed as i thought a bigger room had been booked for the price i paid 
 basic facilities and not enough explanation about hotel services and facilities no hotel guide in room 
 the window isulation was so bad you can hear the some noise and little bit of cold air come inside
 needs updating in the rooms they look a bit tired
 nothing
 for a hotel of that standard the staff were quite miserable
 honestly can t think of anything we ll defiantly be coming back on our next holiday
 no comments
 room was tiny
 room has a low ceiling
 nothing
 don t bother with the buffet breakfast which was a waste of the 20 additional euros per person the bread was obviously left over from the day before as was a chocolate tart and some cookies all stale a lot of pre packaged items a few cereals two small plates one with a few slices of ham the other a few slices of cheese on the buffet table the coffee was weak and lukewarm eggs could be ordered but we skipped them for fear of what they might be like they should check to see the abundant and fresh foods that other hotels are offering for buffet breakfasts either included in the price of the room or for a lot less than 20 euros we opted for it as a time saving convenience on our last day we wanted to leave the breakfast room when we saw it but felt uncomfortable doing so you ll do much better at any local cafe 
 cost of accessible room expensive
 a dirty rundown and dated hotel that needs major upgrading fridge dirty cracked unhygienic and broken small rooms broken windows worst holiday inn so far pillows not soft unlike all other holiday inns
 small room for extra bed very expensiv cost for extra bed 
 bed a bit lumpy and room was a little small
 bathroom door knob was broken and bathroom fittings were not great not enough free tv channels 
 1 was double charged and hotel don t realise until i called and rectify it i was charged by booking com once and by hotel reception desk again 2 couldnt control the a c very warm so have to open the windows should have asked assitance from room service but i didn t 3 i mentioned as special request that i will be arriving between 12 00 1 00 but the receptions said they room won t be ready till 3 but we got another room different from requested room with in 15 mins
 breakfast was good but had to ask for items to be refilled 
 it was quite pricy but overall i was very satisfied 
 the corridors are a bit of a labyrinth and the rooms on the top floor are a bit small otherwise no complaints i ve stayed here a few times now and find it very restful
 wc downstairs smelt of drains in corridor
 nothing 
 we booked a king size bed and we got a queen sized one slight difference but we didn t receive a refund 
 check in was efficient but not particularly friendly 
 nothing i could see that rankled me 
 not a value for money
 i stayed in a single which was a bit small
 the bad view
 poor service from staff when booking
 room size
 walking distance to rooms tiring
 service was a little slow but other than that it was great 
 breakfast is expensive and not so much very basic and if you want something more simply fried eggs for example you have to pay more in the bar there is no service at the table you have to get everything yourselves from the bar i don t mind doing this but if you pay this much for food and drinks i would expect something more if you need a taxi go one street further and get one yourself if the hotel calls one for you you will get a nicer car but for double the price 
 room temperature fluctuated between cold and too hot advised by reception that this was a problem that they d had a while but couldn t fix was given the option of opening a window overlooking the noisy tube line or a fan difficult to sleep very tired decor quality of room service was poor and staff service could be much better 
 got into a dirty bed full of stale breadcrumbs and fingernail clippings at 10 30 at night they moved the room straight away and the receptionist saw it and was really embarrassed when spoke to the management the next day they weren t bothered at all and said they d look into it and call back but nothing they could do they never called back really poor service and completely inexperienced and such a shame given what a great location this is 
 the mini bar want write the price
 lift slow and small could be a problem for some 
 no parking
 the rooms were a little to hot and the air con was not cooling enough for our needs 
 we paid for a superior room and ended up having the push two single beds together to make a double not at all what we paid for disappointing 
 no restaurant but we only had one night so wasn t major
 we were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room how ever it was clean and bed was comfortable 
 noise from trains and wifi not working good a lot of people at the breakfast
 front desk staff was incompetent we had friends and family calling the hotel to get in touch with us but the front desk operator gave info to our friends that we had not arrived yet and that our reservations where canceled and that there where no body in that name at the hotel in spite of us staying at the hotel wrong information was passed on he also had no clue who the guests where totally unfit for the job 
 room service
 shower not working stained carpet in room no biscuits with tea and coffee in room no bar in hotel and no alcohol in mini bar
 we booked late but still feel the price of 179 room only was expensive the bed is small standard double and we were offered a room in which the previous occupant had smoked nowhere to drop luggage off at the entrance which is very inconvenient 
 little noisy
 everything
 everything
 smallish room but ok heating on during the night in room but we should have turned it off at the wall
 tiny gym 
 no air conditioning in the room very small rooms minuscule bathroom decor dated no bar fridge not four star
 kept waiting for an hour for dinner food average it would appear a lack of staff
 early breakfast selected arrived late and i had to leave before being able to eat properly
 the bed is too soft after 3 nights my back pained 
 breakfast
 there was nothing wrong 
 we booked 3 rooms the rooms are very dated and need modernising we asked for a cot in one room and an extra bed in each of the other rooms the cot was there when we arrived but there were no extra beds in the other rooms we had to contact reception and request the two beds when we returned much later on the evening only one bed had been delivered so it was an uncomfortable nights sleep as there was three in the one bed 
 nothing bad
 a bad view for the non street facing rooms some constructions going on b extending our stay for another night would be so expensive much more expensive than previous nights 
 the first room we were given was such a disappointment it was even smaller than a single room there was no way we could fit into that we could not even open our medium size suitcase we immediately requested an upgrade and the next morning we were transferred into a club room which was not much bigger but at least we could open our suitcase all rooms are small apparently in future we can not come back to this hotel with our toddler because of the rooms size 
 still wondering nothing to say 
 only continental breakfast included not a big deal
 nothing
 the staff wasn t very friendly i forgot cards in the room and i wrote an e mail asking that they send me my cards home to date i have not received a response whether my cards were found and whether it is possible to send them to me this is not acceptable for a hotel the room was very loud and the bed was too small for 2 people and not very comfortable 
 staff don t know what is genius 
 no tea coffee in room
 all the touch screens are very high tech but don t work very well
 one of the staff members wasn t happy with our request for a late checkout we asked another staff member at a later stage and they said it was absolutely fine so the issue was resolved 
 nothing
 price
 n a
 steep set of stairs to lug luggage up 
 the pillows were a little small although we did have several that made up for it
 very small room if you travel with small kids 
 i am very sensitive to chemical cleaning products and i was slightly allergic to a product they use to clean the hotel and rooms 
 cold water in the shower low water pressure heating in room turned off
 there was no free internet in the room not enough toiletries the staff did not provide more after my regards 
 the room was slightly on the small side but we only stayed 3 nights so it was ideal for us also breakfast is not included in the hotel price 
 the quality of food
 unfortunately we forgot two rain jackets in the cabinet despite we called and emailed since a one month now the hotel was not able to send them back to us even we offered to pay for the delivery we are very disappointed since we think this service should be provided by a four stare hotel 
 be sure that a design hotel is the experience you are really looking for the all black bathroom was disconcerting 
 the furniture were old but it didn t bothered us much 
 there is no swimming pool 
 air con was a bit noisy but a few wines helped this was prob just our room 
 wish we could stay longer 
 nothing 
 advertisement is deceiving room was poor 
 staff was not overly attentive rooms were exceptionally small and the shower screen did not adequately protect the bathroom floor 
 room was a bit outdated missing some closet space bathroom quiet small airdryier to be improved for long hair it would take 1 hour parking is expensive considering it is valet 
 the wi fi was very bad very week as well room is little pit narrow for 2 persons their luggage there is need to check the room especially the bath bath room before the next guest come 
 evevry thing is nice but small bathrooms
 no tea and coffee making facilities in room 
 only thing was that it is a little bit noisy at night but that is paris 
 tv screen very old mattresses a little tired 
 i had dinner in bar 17 which was nice but a little pricey for what i got
 had slight problem with main course this was dealt with very efficiently and taken off my bill service a little slow in restaurant but i was in no hurry and happy to sit back and relax 
 slightly small room
 we found nothing to complain about sometimes we had to wait for a table at breakfast 
 the room and toilet weren t very big but it was more than ok for me i would just add a second chair in a room for two people 
 unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for 1 2 hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available i did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free 
 the tv in the room didn t work the shower was overflowing when taking a shower
 we were given room for persons with disability as a result bathroom was very uncomfortable no stand for toiletries shower was on the floor resulting in the bathroom flooding with water and very small low sink 
 the man at the reception he is totally unfriendly and shouldn t be at the reception to welcome tourists 
 my room was very small but as i asked a ground floor room i don t know if the others are bigger i can only be grateful for being at a ground floor room as i asked 
 we had to pay14 50 per person total waste of money the service was shocking and the food very poor selection toaster gave you bread back instead of toast the overall experience bad will never have breakfast there again 
 nothing 
 small room
 room was quite stuffy and a bit noisy due to air con
 the hotel is let down by the restaurant which is not typical of a hdv staff seemed to be rushing around but not actually doing anything several hot evening meals had to go back as they were cold this was rectified with alternatives quickly service was also slow we all got the impression that the comments we were making were not unusual as they were greated with apathy breakfast was also cold and had to be sent back 
 eating out in this area is way over priced but you can get around that by using the nearby grocery stores fruit stands and bakery to pack your own meals 
 medioucre breakfast
 nothing
 poor room facilities says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it rooms are tiny for a 4 star to not have any room service is poor has a fridge which was empty no guest service book had to guess how to even call reception i travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again 
 nothing we were so pleased with our stay at the gore hotel 
 outside area bar more unique and breakfast
 nothing
 drink prices in bar 
 a little bit expensive
 the room is not clean bad smell from the carpet airconditioner was not working toilet not clean enough 
 the headboards on the bed were very worn leather and the shower leaked
 the hotel is tired and needs modernising on a grand scale we were not told that the tube runs directly under our window if we had been we would have requested a room on the other side of the building the bathroom was old and needed a refit on one of the days they forgot to clean our room 
 a little bit of a walk to luxembourg gardens but only ten minutes
 shabby room extremely uncomfortable bed unclean bathroom in a very bad state of repair with paint peeling and dirty grouting small coarse towels and wifi that did not work air conditioning also did not work properly 
 very very poor wifi breakfast spread is limited not much choice 
 no fitness
 the room was very small for the price i paid 
 the non smoking bar area could have been more inviting may be something that will look at in the future 
 room is a bit too small
 service
 we tried to order room service in the early hours of the morning really disappointed with the experience rang the phone a number of times and there was no answer in the end my partner went down to reception to find 2 inidividuals there who were sat ignoring the phone not great but the food was good when it arrived 
 nothing
 is quite far away city center you should take metro but it is close too it takes 15 minutes to reach city centre by metro 
 breakfast wasn t included 
 nothing
 there was a few places that could have used a little more detail when cleaning 
 the rooms are just too stark feels like shore ditch 10 years ago 
 room had window washing cart cables outside window wasn t happy with the room and noise so ended up having to pay for upgrade of room upgraded room was very shabby condition stains on walls carpet and leak in the bathroom sofa had tare in it kettle didn t work had to be replaced spoke to staff on check out very poor attitude about it arguing with me room service was very poor food overpriced
 the bathroom was very small there were cobwebs above the lamp shades hanging from the high ceilings 
 it was noisy in corridor at night other guests not really the hotel s fault
 nothing everything was fine 
 the rooms are old and shabby and to be renovated breakfast buffet is far too expensive for what it is very bland and not authentic this was the biggest disappointment 
 nothing bad at all 
 i can t put my finger on anything
 nothing 
 nothing
 the elevator was always down
 view
 we paid 570 euros for 3 nights and the room we got was small and it smelt of urine we then said we wanted another room as this doesn t make sense in terms of the payment made the hotel considers this as a standard room they then gave us the same room on a different floor but that was old and tired as the paint was coming off everywhere and the bathroom was not cleaned properly at the end we asked for a junior suite and got a good deal led by jose the receptionist thanks but again it was nothing special this hotel is not a global 4 star hotel as advertised i have been to 3 star hotels which were better the hotel is actually called hesperial hotel and only inside you find out that it is part of the nh group would i come here again for the same money no would i come again if it was based on value for money yes 
 the foyer could have been better i did not like the rug in there the car park was horrible i did not like it at all some times the gate would close on you before you had gone through it we had to ring the buzzer to stop it smashing into our car quite dangerous 
 should have more hot food for breakfast
 room temperature could not be controlled did not work room was cold all windows in the hotel and in our room were not able to be opened room design idea is cold business style during check in we were told that drinks in the lobby were for free but this was only true for drinks at the restaurant not at the lobby so we were presented an unpleasant extra bill during check out 
 one needs to ask the reception to enter the tract with the appartment not very convenient and not appropriate given the price for the apartment 
 single room good but a little small if staying more than a few days 
 rooms small
 the receptionist seemed to be taking about air conditioning not being available in some rooms but mine was fine it s a bit difficult to find the lifts but the reception staff helped me the location opposite rivoli gardens can be a bit noisy at night 
 nothing
 bread was mouldy at breakfast room menu out of date
 better customer service needed excessively small room 
 very bad service and very dirty rooms
 make the breakfast more healthy please 
 couldn t get a drink at all at night no mini bar no room service
 the only thing which is not so convenient is parking on booking is written that hotel is providing parking to guests but actually it is public garage which is not so close takes you 5 min walking distance and if you have to carry luggage it is not so easy also it is not possible to approach hotel entrance by car as it is pedestrian area so guests should be informed before arrival for safe side and not to lose too much time on searching the hotel also room was a little cold and staff couldn t help with that unfortunately but i guess it is because of season end of march still these are just small recommendations but we would anyhow return back as it is very nice hotel 
 it s old hotel room are small we expect to be different but it was ok 
 can not think of a thing wait it needed an out let to plug in a device 
 it s a big hotel with so many rooms and my room happened to be in an area you need to go up and down the stairs for about 10minutes from the reception area i think you just have to enjoy this little adventure 
 w8 bar rather soulesss
 nothing everything was perfect 
 room could be a bit spacious
 could have moremilk and tea bags or bigger choice of hot drinks in room
 our room had no natural light breakfast was not included in the room rate these two things were disappointing given the quality of the hotel and the room rate making the value for money questionable 
 old creeky small awful hotel 
 all of it 
 this is our second stay at hotel ambassador and to the opposite of the first visit this stay was a horror we booked the same type of top floor apartment we stayed in last time and paid the same price for what was supposed to be a 44 square meter luxurious apartment with two floors and two big terraces but were shocked to be shown to a tiny room sitting area which could never be more than 30 meters with no balconies or even a view and had all sloped ceilings and walls that we banged our heads on whenever we moved when we complained to the receptionist she answered us with a stony face that i cant do anything to help you and will not refund you as your booking is non refundable when i asked to talk to the manager and explained that this is not what we paid full price for as it has nothing that is shown in the websites pictures she answered coldly that yes the description of the room on booking com is a little misleading even when we asked them for simple things like cups or pans we were never even answered to cut it short our holiday was ruined by an utter disgrace of a room and the poker faced deceptive staff 
 size of the room
 even though outdoor temperatures were very decent for the season the bathroom was very cold no additional heating provided 
 old building with a lot of noises and just a bath no shower
 there is no parking but there is parking in the next building it costs 60 day
 we could not open the window and the heat was stifling 
 breakfast over price
 nil
 the swimming pool sauna were to small no cooked meals until after 8pm only light snacks a portacabin with workers in looking up at the windows
 only one teabag each in the room when i asked for another teabag they gave me some but could not supply any milk very odd also when ordering drinks at the bar we were waiting for 30 minutes as there was only one person behind the bar two others just walking about and he was pratting around making a cocktail while flicking left and right 
 nil
 took me a while to activate the wifi but once i did it was super
 i asked to the recepcionist an extra blanket at night and the guy said that they did not have and only in the morning but inside the room it is written that if you need any thing like extra pillow or anything else it was just to call the reception but in my case at night did not work 
 the bathroom was not 4 star standard bad soundproofing of the room could hear the people in the room next door cough sneeze shower etc 
 not all staff seem to want to be putting the customer first but management where interested about my stay
 varied cost per day extra for early check in despite 5 days
 nothing 
 the manner of the receptionist at the check in date he could have been more polite 
 the design of the suite isn t good and you can see strange things happen through out the window where the prostitution at night going on in the street just open the window and see for free i also waited long time in the reception to make check in i will never ever get back again 
 i think it was a bit over price base off of the neighborhood also after paying 170 a night paying for a cold breakfast buffet was ridiculous breakfast should be included 
 my room was terribly small 
 check in was a complete joke paid extra for a bridge view only to be obscured by a massive tree it either wants trimming or completely cutting down won t be staying here again you get better service and value at a premier inn 
 breakfast could ve been cheaper i d have loved to take advantage of it but 22 per person is a bit steep other than that nothing
 sadly the bad was too soft for me but my girlfriend loved it 
 as there isn t 24hr reception coffee facilities in the room would have been nice 
 key was old fashioned had a 0 5 kg dongle attached to it the hallways are old fashioned and due for an update the wifi router was just hanging from the ceiling the rooms facing the main street are very busy because the window and balcony doors are old and don t seal properly any longer 
 that we had to leave seriously there wasn t anything that we didn t like about the hotel except a very minor detail we didn t like the scent of the pen ink soap that was used everywhere but other than
 the hotel is not designed to be antique it s an old hotel everything is broke the bathroom is a mess everything is just so cheap and the safe is broke as well where can people put there personal belongings the electricity went off in half of the cables like honestly even 3 stars is too much for this hotel i m done plus there s only one elevator that gets stuck every now and then you can t fit more than 1 bag and 3 persons what kind of 4 stars hotel is this 
 the room was very clean till i noticed an open bag of chips under the bed 
 internet connectivity was absolutely awful could get email but everything else was basically non functional 
 lighting was terrible in the room a bit far out from the central
 the long tortuous journey to our room
 lack of information on arrival about hotel facilities room ok but not great
 the air con was a bit noisy but in the bigger scheme of things that was nothing 
 breakfast costly at 20 euros per person
 uncomfortable pillows rooms too dark
 nothing 
 thinking the price we paid it is ridicilious that we had to pay for the slippers the breakfast included in the room price is only the continental and we had to pay 5 5 pounds per person for the hot breakfast air condition was blowing directly towards the bed there is not even a bottle of water in the fridge 
 you can t alter it but for aust travellers the rooms are very small couldn t open cases on the ground got around this
 unable to open window for fresh air
 a few little maintenance bits and bobs to be done in the room but nothing that impacted on our stay
 noiseproff is not the best
 no complaints
 nothing it was all good 
 the room numbering is not consecutive so it was hard for me to reach my friends easily 
 nothing 
 breakfast to expensive
 restaurant for breakfast far too small for the amount of guests in hotel no shower facilities for guests to freshen up after check out 
 the staff no smiles didn t look happy at all the 3 we met only one was polite that was the young lady on reception whilst booking in the free wifi we didn t use but reception said it cuts out a lot didn t have breakfast so cannot comment 
 the room lacked facilities e g no hairdryer or iron the bathroom for a room that was 160 excluding breakfast was outdated the noise was terrible you could hear every door and pipe being used only one thin pillow was supplied in the room i could go on 
 the elevator was broken and we had to walk up w baggage to 4th floor i was also double charged 
 there wasn t anything i didn t like 
 restaurant very noisy
 nothing
 false fire alarm bathroom very snug
 the location is certainly not in city center its just the hotel is tryin to make a impression of it the area around is horible all city services around and the parking was hard to find 
 felt to far out plates needed to b warm at breakfast
 we celebrated my girlfriends 21st birthday and nobody come to wish happy birthday until i went down and told the staff at reception despite me telling them previously also i paid for a room with a balcony yet we didn t have one 
 the price should be better
 expensive breakfast and in nearby area is difficult to find a good cafe untidy bathroom 
 no plug near mirror in wardrobe to use straighteners didn t like coffee packets not enough milk cartons little things i know
 room was very small view from window not pleasant shower cubical very small air conditioning too loud preventing a good nights sleep cost of room 219 00 was way too expensive 
 a bit noisy at night 
 staff were rude room inadequate offers not fulfilled no toilet paper one day overall very disappointed
 lift was extremely small and meant we had to wait a while for an empty lift on the morning of check out to fit our family luggage 
 the reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems definitely i ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel when you ask reception that can i have a bottle of water you will got right away this answer we have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back you have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning 
 minibar was well over priced 2 for a snickers bar come on hotel not that obvious from road side 
 the staff here have serious attitude problems at all levels especially own at the gym and spa 
 the staff at the desk when tried to call for any thing they were unhelpful and actually the were rude 
 i phoned to change the room from a twin to a double and was able to do this however i was not advised that an extra charge was being added for this change 
 lift broken
 i would say that the room and bathroom were not very clean the bathtub hose was leaking as well the shower the pool is only available during summer 
 i have stayed at the same hotel before and feel the sink is too shallow and the water does not drain quickly 
 no
 that even though i gave a generous cash tip in the bar i was still charged a service charge i hadn t completed myself
 nothing
 we got room in which somebody smoked the receptionist changed our room but i think the second room was more worn out
 nothing
 i had a problem with a hairdryer not working and the tv suddenly went silent on both occasions the staff responded quickly and found a replacement hairdryer and rebooted the tv but it would have been nice not to have to call for help 
 i think the breakfast is a little expensive but probably 10 is the average price for hotels 
 no shuttle bus as described we have to walk 1km from the bus stop and in the evening the neighborhood it s not very appealig i asked for an invoice when i arrived and they said they could give it to me only when i check out that was strange because i had a flight in the morning and i had to wake up ealier to go to the reception and do the invoice with the person there so this was frutarating becasue instead of getting longer sleep i had to waste another 20 30 mintues in that morning at the receptionit
 the air conditioning had been turned on so the rooms got very stuffy and warm during the night and this could not be fixed 
 not vert clean and cold room 
 loud neighbors 
 nothing
 no english language tv channels no milk for tea and a teapot would be useful as the cups are too small for tea bags supplied that are meant for teapots tea selection not good had to buy normal tea bags 
 breakfast facilities and breakfast offering
 the bar at the hotel was a tad pricey especially for us as we travelled as a young couple 
 i payed a lot for a very plane rooms
 general facilities such as breakfast very limited
 the hotel has two floors with rooms where smoking is allowed unfortunately we got such a room not very happy because i suffer from asthma there was no option to change to another non smoking room did not know smoking was still allowed in european hotels next time i book a hotel i will specifically request a non smoking room just to be sure 
 tasteless cereals could have had greater variety of fruit
 everything was good
 rooms are small for one ok for two lack of storage having the bathroom not separate from room might be less comfortable if you are two 
 too cold first room was in quadi basement so we moved
 the room very basic for that many we paid expected at list normal cubs for tea or coffee pictures on the internet looks much better then in real in the morning the clener just opend the door without any notice i was standing naked and shouting we are still hear realy for the many we paid i was expecting a little bit better room we reqested view for eifel tower and we had a view for parking waiting time for the check in was too long i think everything is not very well organised 
 a bit too far from the centre of town e8 e10 cab ride one way 
 the room is small and old building
 nothing
 very scruffy decor and should included breakfast for that sort of money
 the price of breakfast if it is not in a prepaid deal is way too high 
 mobile phones allowed in dinning room sat next to visitor who was talking on her phone all through our breakfast 
 we were disappointed with the housekeeping a bit they were very late to tidy the room and one of them was very rude and unprofessional at all we complained about him at front office 
 we ourder from the hotel to clean up our room they sayed will change us that was surprising me 
 in true european tradition there were no wash clothes however they do provide one bath sponge not a poofy per room it would have been nice to have two because there were two of us 
 the controls for the bath and shower were complicated and my wife decided not to try a shower as we were only staying for 2 days 
 on 3rd day breakfast was abysmal i had to ask for almost everything the person on the breakfast area did not fill up at all in the end i was embarrassed because i had to ask for so much and the female attending had a bit of an attitude problem bread was low all end bits she was argumentative melon only one type there just came to the stage that i couldn t ask anymore no butter apparently on 3rd day they didn t have individual packets one had to ask and it would have been cut handy if one had been informed in advance orange juice only had dregs i asked for ham this had also run out so she brought beef then proceeded to use the fish fork to put some on my plate needless to say i didn t have any she needs training and an attitude transplant 
 everything costs extra breakfast 38 use of the spa 42 wifi 25 it is free on our local bus please bear in mind you will only get the room and everything else costs a lot extra making it extremely poor value for families they also took more than the whole cost of our stay from our credit card as a guarantee when we arrived even though they said we would not be charged and then charged a second full amount when we paid our bill we had to wait for over a week for our card to be refunded with the first guarantee debit so allow for this we have stayed in many 5 star hotels in different parts of the world but this has never been a problem before 
 the pool area had green mould on the floor on the steps to get in out the pool one of the supporting arms was loose 
 nothing
 found my bed a little uncomfortable and terrible pillow also hate those hairdryers take forever to dry hair and don t do it well also hotel too warm even though we had no heating on in our room 
 noisy neighbours obviously can t help that but it s the only fault i had with my stay 
 scaffolding and decor a little tired 
 unfortunately this hotel just needs to be refurbished or at least replace the mattresses they are awful and have really bad spring problems in both of the rooms we tried after being moved we were told that all of the mattresses are the same considering i stay at the hilton in numerous locations this was a real let down and i believe i should have been refunded i even went away with a bad ache 
 every thing perfect
 room was very small and the bed wasn t long enough i m 6ft 3 cold feet 
 staff was not fully aware of the terms and conditions of using the car park and kept referring us to ibis hotel who they shared the car park with the room was relatively small it was quite cramped for 3 adults 
 entrata garage
 nothing 
 wifi connection and coverage was bad
 not sure room was a superior room which was booked as it was very small and no shower screen so bathroom got soaked
 disappointed that i did not get what i requested found receptionist unhelpful on arrival hotel reception area could do with some brighning up also bedrooms could do with some tlc room was too warm and found difficult to regulate the air condition 
 poor maintenance in room asked for more tea bags but didn t get them 
 nothing
 too many mirrors in the room poor view
 outdated rooms only 2 and slow elevators the hotel is deserves no more than 4 star
 real issue with hot water lack of and although advertised to have a bar area this consisted of a small bar counter and chairs in the reception area which was not conjusive to a relaxing environment 
 rooms are very cold very old fashioned design and furnitures doom lightning is weak and no mirror in the room 
 the room is too small
 nothing
 no air ventilation windows couldnt be opened
 very expensive breakfast with very little to choose from and quite a lot run out only 1 very small lift working in our 4 night stay i wouldn t class it as a 4 star hotel 
 a c noise
 decoration is looking a little worn 
 too noisy in the mornings with other guests and housekeepers banging on doors really early apart from that the hotel was nice 
 nothing
 lounge club offer is zero 
 all fine
 the bed was too small
 very very poor value for money poky room tiny shower poor fittings for the same price go to the mercure much much better
 bad wifi signal
 none
 no negatives 
 rude staff appalling levels of service maid came in each day without knocking or noting the do not disturb union aggressive protest threatening guests demonstration
 nothing
 fortunately for us the weather was amazing the only thing we had an issue with was the air conditioning it was so hot in the room when we got in there it would have been really nice if someone had put it on 
 nothing would be even better if the hotel had a spa
 the mp3 player did not work
 no breakfast
 the hotel should partcipate the prize of the garage
 they did not clean the room despite asking them twice slow service in the hotel bar
 free parking on site as you can park outside for free at night for free anyway 
 annoying sideways shower
 the worst room service experience ever 
 i liked everything this hotel had to offer 
 nothing
 more options and the ability to order more food
 service is ok can improve i have to ask for new glass of tea coffe they didn t change everyday no new cleaned glass of water as well they didn t change
 hotel claims to have air condition it most certainly has but it s not working till the 1st of the may if you get room on the attic you will feel sorry that you chose the senator rooms are small and stuffy
 there wasn t a thing that i could possibly fault
 an easy chair for this standard of room should be provided
 left some change in the room mid stay but someone thought it was a tip would normally leave a tip at the end not during a stay
 nothing
 i didn t like that you could only have the business lounge breakfast and not the main one without paying my room was cleaned ok but details where missed and my mini bar was not replenished 2 days in a row asked for an iron from the front desk when it didn t come i rang up and reception was a little rude
 could have had more in free mini bar ie 2 beers
 like many other hotels in vienna it does not have ac though they provide fan
 internet seemed to go off and on had to sign in every time i used my computer or cell phone half duvet cover on bed was not very clean water temp hard to regulate tea not very good
 teppichboden
 the small double was really really small 
 dirty torn blankets with holes and burnt black marks by cigareetes were on the bed in the room 
 the hotel is a family business and guests are perhaps sometimes treated a little too much like family members
 but far from the station and didn t have bath tub in the bathroom
 the location of the room everyday morning i can hear the noise from the outside 
 some more information about the hotel to be provided in the room room service could have been slightly more helpfully served rather than a stack of plates delivered and left with caveat i could no doubt of asked the friendly person would prefer the phone not to ring on the hour each hour 
 furnishings and fitments in bedrooms need replacing public area o k but bar area feels like a public waiting room 
 the price of the wine 
 noisy installation work during my stay mini fridge in the room contained nothing not even water and it was tooo noisy as well 
 very poor service at breakfast both mornings
 rooms a little cramped but compensated by great location 
 the price of the breakfast is too expensive
 no sauna swimming pool
 do not rely on the pictures as a guide as the rooms are smaller than pictured not great value for money in terms of the room but we were not in it that often so it didn t affect us too much 
 roof top bar opening hours very limited so i was unable to see which is a shame
 nothing
 our shower curtain didn t cover the whole tub and water leaked out onto the floor easily 
 very basic facilities and small rooms however wasn t a problem as we were out all day and only sleeping there 
 bad house keeping
 floor carpet is stained
 walls are made of paper carton between the rooms this means you will enjoy all activities in the 20 rooms around you this is a kind of very nice looking ymca on a great location 
 wi fi is not very powerful in the rooms the tv signal was intermittent breaking down from time to time the carpets in the room require a bit more cleaning than the daily one nothing that would prevent me from coming back to the hotel of course not all the staff spoke english even though it was visible they were making an effort to communicate efficiently was a bit shocked when i spotted additional charged in my final bill and a new member of the team at check out told me the charges were fine thank god ida appeared and sorted everything out including the crediting of the additional 140 eur would recommend to train new staff members in a way so they can spot errors at check out efficiently 
 parking is too expensive
 the bad was awful a board screwed to the board is a joke at least in a premier inn you can have a decent nights sleep could not close the window as it was broke 13 quid for wifi is a rip off who charges for wifi nowadays anything to make a quick buck do not stay here it s very very average
 only stayed one night and wished we had more time to enjoy the facilities particularly the spa and restaurant 
 guests smoking and chatting on a walkway right outside our room at 6 30am 
 dinner at the hotel was not that great but the area around there did not have many open restaurants 
 a larger duvet on our double bed
 no jem
 gym was too small maybe partner with a neighbouring gym 
 none
 parking opposite cost us 66 euros for 24h 
 estrange layout of the room flashy decore minor thing for me 
 location and cost
 a little bit more vegetables in breakfast 
 breakdast service very slow on borh days we were there i had eaten my breakfast before my husbands had arrived even though they were more or less the same hotel a little grubby in places i e net curtains at windows dirty marks on walls little things i know but the hotel does have 4 diamonds
 when we checked in the staff were abrupt except for a young male employee we were not made welcome the lobby is very small and uncomfortable no refreshments were offered after getting our room the bathroom floor needed renewing and an overhaul there was no outside window but we were out all day and it was only 2 nights 
 the breakfast was poor
 breakfast we paid to have the club rooms that have a special breakfast but the breakfast was quite poor so we were asked to pay more to go to the regular breakfast room breakfast could be improved for sure 
 the outside dining area does not have a ramp just steps so not accessible for disabled
 pillows far too hard 
 bacon and scrambled eggs tepid
 nothing perfect 
 nothing
 there was no privacy when using the bathroom as the doors were translucent 
 hotel is not clean is old and was cold in room ac warm doesnt work
 we reserve for 4 twin beds what we got were 2 twin beds and 2 cots with barely enough space to move around 
 we bought a small glass of wine in the sky bar which cost 10 which was far too expensive and the service was not particularly good although the views were good 
 beds little hard pillows too flat 
 the glass shower and toilet doors are open to the room that made my 20 year old daughter staying with us uncomfortable there should be some sort of barrier to provide some privacy other than that the hotel is wonderful 
 expensive breakfast
 nothing adversesoconvenient
 my daughter had baked beans and they were cold
 breakfast too expensive so went to different cafes in vienna instead which we enjoyed
 poor view
 the room was very hot when i arrived the sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective the inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows i asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was i assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while i was out however they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night made for a poor nights sleep 
 that the same bar refreshments as below were not available on level 7 and bar prices were expensive
 nothing
 besides provided of double glasses the windows of the room badly isolate atmospheric agents and from external noises that being in the city center are on 24 hours curtains were stained by humidity probably because when it rains some water drops in the room has a spectacular view over the roof interior but the glass that separates from it is dirty 
 room a little tired broken drawer electric socket not working dried blood on toilet basin
 bedroom was too small to walk around the bed properly bar didn t open till 8pm hotel ignored request for rooms to be close to each other
 four of us in a family room not enough towels provided no shower gel we almost ran out of toilet paper the tissues did run out 
 i have actually cut my shin on the ledge around the bed as i hit it when walking up to the bed and didn t expect it also taking a payment from my card to guarantee the hotel when i had already pre paid still waiting for funds to be returned 
 the air conditioni g was not working properly as it required a service 
 the bed was too soft not good for my back although this is very individual to myself you can t please everyone it would have been nice if breakfast was available that day earlier than usual for those running the marathon 
 nothing
 i know it might be normal in milano but sorry this place is way to expensive for what it offers i am not saying in comparison to other hotels in milano just in comparison to my general feeling after travelling for years the people working at the reception are not exactly angels of politeness but we got along location was good if you were merely passing through milano but a bit far from the center if you want to avoid metros about 30 minutes walking 
 receptionist asked a little too many questions when checking in calling the room once we had gotten in is not necessary eve not though the room is clean the cupboard was not checked as the previous persons dry cleaning was not taken out 
 ok facilities and a little noisy
 food too expensive nobody in the lovely restaurant reduce prices to get people in 
 shower was open in bedroom wouldn t be suitable if not a couple
 too noisy you can hear the people in the room next door 
 no parking space left in the hotel 
 for us nothing not to like 
 window would not latch properly poor first nights sleep due to outside noise fixed with a paper wedge after no joy at reception great second night
 size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people the 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person 
 beds were a bit soft and the pillows were very flat 
 would be good to have more choices for breakfast
 inconsiderate guests who didn t think of others 
 the only problem was having to use cote brassiere for a cooked breakfast 
 i suppose like everywhere drinks were a bit expensive and i thought 23 each for breakfast was too much especially when there are plenty of places to eat 2 minutes walk away around st paul s cathedral
 minor point colors could be less flashy in the room
 no phone charger in room
 slow check in around 7 check in desks but only 2 were open in spite of plenty of staff walking around expensive car park small rooms the lounge closes too early we got back from a show at 10 30 and the lounge was closed so we had to have our quiet drink in the taven pub part of the hotel that was very noisy beware of the car park contaminated water dripped from the ceiling and marked the paintwork on our car breakfast was average and the restaurant was far too hot to eat comfortably in 
 everything was nice
 wi fi connection was poor
 the hotel restaurants should give priority to hotel residents we could not reserve a table in one of its 2 restaurants in a whole week whether lunch or dinner 
 it takes a bit long on the public transport to get to the centre of amsterdam 
 i had a king room and it was a bit smaller than what i was used too but it didn t affect the comfort level of my stay
 dimly lit corridors with inadequate safety signage on steps caused me to have an accident during my stay staff were ill equipped to deal with this and did not speak very good english 
 we were given room 301 which is an adapted room for people with disabilities this room is not suitable for able bodied in particular if you are tall as the sink is vey low i am not even sure whether this room is suitable for people with disabilities as the bathroom is very slippery and lighting is very poor the room is spacious 
 nothing
 other receptionists less friendly rooms not suitable for families as bathing area lacks privacy and rooms are too small roof top pool bar not open during the day the air conditioning in our room 920 made a very loud motor noise every half an hour even through the night which disturbed sleep mini fridge in room was hardly cold and the coffee machine didn t work as the water just poured out 
 not able to check in on arrival not advised to leave bags but to come back inefficient elevators cold room tv froze regularly having stayed in other millennium hotels especially new york we were disappointed with the overall feel of your hotel
 nothing at all 
 room too small for the 
 rooms are pretty basic for the price i was disappointed when i entered the room for the first time rooms need to be refurbished or modernised the breakfast area is too small i came for breakfast one morning and there was absolutely no seat available i had to wait for 10 minutes before being able to access the buffet 
 the only downside is the station tower hilll not that many trains go through there waited 45mins for a train to kings cross and ended up going for a taxi 
 there was 4 of us mother and 3 daughters the suite was lovely but only had 1 bed my sisters slept on the sofas which weren t very clean 
 small single room shower tiny larger frames wouldn t fit didn t get explanation about card operated lifts before getting into it and i hate lifts lighting unattractive in room a side lamp would be less harsh 
 i had to phone twice to get coffee etc ordered for my room as cleaner forgot to replace on one day got back to my room at 3 30 to find it had still not been cleaned and had to request it being done and go downstairs to have a tea whilst they did our room this was after o tiring day when all we wanted to do was relax 
 should have booked an earlier checkin as we arrived too early
 foyer was just a through route nowhere really cosy to sit and read the paper keys didn t work when we returned most days coffee bar was very geared to meals no comfy chairs in informal areas 
 our room was very small and didn t have a window it wa also extremely noisy in the morning as we were right next to the cafe area not a great deal of choice for breakfast
 none 
 whilst i had a generous upgrade i d have preferred more light view the attic studios are spacious but small windows 
 lobby bar sometimes too busy with locals and guests at hotel could not get a look in had to go out of hotel to have a bar drink as no room to sit in lobby 
 bed a bit soft desk in room a bit small
 breakfast was a bit ordinary 
 rooms a bit outdated but comfortable 
 1 staff member was quite rude and totally ignored me when i asked politely for some more tea 
 didn t like that on the second morning there was a long queue for breakfast people were having to give their room numbers and wait to be called there were about ten rooms to be called before us and we didn t have enough time to wait so we had to have a continental breakfast in the main entrance which was quite draughty from the door being constantly opened as people were coming and going however the waitress was very attentive water for shower bath took a long time to run hot and bathroom was a bit chilly no complimentary biscuits in the room 
 bathrooms not comfortable and a c in one of the rooms was not efficient i used novotel in geneve during same trip and rooms were much better 
 nothing
 air conditioning
 electronic door key was erratic and required several attempts to work every time
 rooms were cold 
 nothing
 checking in took a long time breakfast was a scrum
 the food and drinks we re really dear 19 95 for a full breakfast beyond a joke 
 food and drink seemed a little expensive but probably in line with a five star city hotel it seemed a bit tricky to use the pool as it seems like a restaurant with a pool in it we went up to the roof for a drink which was lovely and the views are stunning but would have felt awkward swimming there certainly wouldn t want to have turned up in swimwear with a towel 
 we booked a double room and the bed pulled apart into two twin beds a staff member moved us from room to room several times we also called for an iron which came an hour later and then they had the nerve to charge us more late check out when in fact it was their fault furthermore there was no supervisior or manager on the premises to deal with our problems appalled by the service 
 small room
 we would like a slightly better rate on the hotel because we do travel to amsterdam alot for work 
 the location is good but it s not so central 
 water system at shower bathtub is very poor drainage is bad water does not drain well 
 nothing it was perfect
 given room that wasn t cleaned from last person needed to return to front desk to be given another room
 one of the pillows was not changed there were a lot of hair on it i put it away because i could use other pillows that were clean next day the pillow was again put on the bed but still not changed with the hair on it 
 small rooms broken taps and drain in bathroom no flair not worth the money and the stars
 on event day england playing car park at hotel shot up in price from 10 to 25 we checked in on monday and my car did not move until wednesday morning but i was penalized for the event with increased parking charges not fair 
 i don t think it is right policy for a 4 star hotel to take deposit for each night which leads to some 100 200 euro blocked on your card it s a terrible mistrust
 food was very expensive well that may be a paris thing 
 they told me by mail that i will have a big room with bed 200 200 and then we come and they gave us a small room with bed 140 200 and we had to pay 50 extra for a baby 1 year who sleeps with us wasnt comfortable at all dissapointted 
 the room was a previously smoking room it was smelly the reception was not so nice the parking was not free of charge for guests but it was under the hotel 
 rooms are outdated and hotel needs to be refurbished at the earliest 
 trying to get the heating working
 would have liked tea coffee facilities in the room 
 the staff not really that friendly sometimes 
 breakfast
 the room was not perfectly clean had some stuff left next to my bed and they stayed for 2 days missing shampoo and cream
 the room was very small
 there was no shade by the pool
 i was a one person traveler asked for double bed got two singles pushed together for the amount of money i paid out this was probably the most expensive and yet the room in comparison to others was below average
 na
 overall we were very happy i wish there were king sized rooms and also safes in the room
 far too expensive
 how expensive it is but it s understandable when it s near the excel
 cleaner esp carpets
 a little too hot in the room 
 alot the elevator was very poor and has old mode l the ac at the room was leaking a lot of water and when i reported to reception they deal with it by very stupid and foolish way they hang a towel from the ac till the floor and it was blocking the entrance of the room we just take it off and thank god it was one night only last thing they came to us when its almost midnight and says some of you smoking in the room because the alarm started although we didn t hear anything and no one of us ever smoked they didnt smell anything and left
 parking lifts
 they charged me fifty pounds extra upon arrival and said that it would be returned upon departure i asked them to email me a copy of the bill rather than print it which i never received and checked my internet banking that afternoon and noticed that i was charged 189 instead of 139 for one night they never returned the fifty pounds i emailed them promptly and two days later almost i still haven t got a reply from them not impressed 
 our room only had a window in the roof would have preferred it in the wall
 the room was a little cold
 the bed was ok but not great 
 wi fi could be more reliable
 their automated check in system sucks and for a business hotel it is atrocious that this system doesnt give you an invoice breakfast is 19 
 no gym in the same building you need to access to the neighbour jumeirah hotel 
 single beds too close together and should offer shower cap for the type of shower
 basement room next to the lien room strong chemical smell
 the only thing i found was that if you are in a basement room on the weekend when you might want a lie in the chairs scraping back and forth during breakfast is disturbing 
 the neighborhood around the train station is quite dodgy
 no alcohol i like a drink from the hotel bar when away this hotel should inform you of this before booking
 dirty windows in restraurant no free wifi some rooms have no windows 
 hard bed
 there was nothing i did not like 
 nothing
 the curtains didn t meet in the room so very light and very noisy from the train station had a awful nights sleep bar closed very early so only cocktail bar available very expensive and sat for20 minutes and didn t get served so went to the pub over the road instead
 na
 when i had checked my bank acct when we got home there was a discrepancy as 2 payments had been taken i rang and spoke to the night manager who was extremely rude and unhelpful
 too expancive
 the rooms were a little cramped i accept in london you are limited by pace but at that price it was a little surprising to have such a small bathroom and bedroom 
 none
 nothing really 
 the first night we had a really loud room facing the busy street 
 rooms are cold there is no heating system they charged more still my 100 euros deposit is refunded
 if you are lucky you will meet only friendly and helpful staff most of them if you are not lucky you will meet rude staff so you will never stay again there 
 had to ask 5 times for a cup of tea our plug in the bath was stuck in so we could not empty it had to stand in cold water for two days we reported it but no one fixed it the safe broke with all our valuables inside no towels in bathroom 
 the one room we had was right off the elevator so there was noise from that not really loud but if you were awake you could hear it 
 the service in the restaurant was very slow though the food was great 
 having a continental that was a bit cheap and the rooms was very small and when we booked it said that we would have a room on the highest floor and with a view instead we got a tiny room without any windows on the first floor 
 there was no room service 
 communal areas felt slightly dated undergoing refurb which we were not made aware of on booking no proper bar restaurant due to refurb so make shift in conference room which was a disappointment bar restaurant conference room too hot 
 room was so small and box like
 bed was very hard just tempered by the mattress topper on second day i asked for milk 4 times in total and the male supervisor in his suit quite clearly thought it was below him chef was not on top of the cooked breakfast and many people ended up hanging around for missing items of food 
 the sandwiches were very expensive
 the gym was a little small and very hot but there was enough equipment there to do a reasonable work out and fortunately it was never busy when i used it 
 i was overcharged the price i was quoted on booking com was not what i was charged i m waiting for them to resolve the issue 
 far from the useful metro station it means that there is a metro station very near but if you want to go to scenic spots you have to go to another futher metro station but it s near sagrada familia 
 n a
 nothing
 situated at 12 metro stations from the city center about 30 min in a industrial area the ugliest entrance in a 4 star hotel i ve ever seen 
 only little negative points the room for the massage was perhaps a little cold and open to the ceiling so you can hear the people who are at the gym you have to wait a little so that the water in the shower is warm but nothing serious unfortunately the turkish bath did not work 
 squeaky beds in our twin room kettle and cups were in the bottom of the wardrobe 3 day stay resulted in 51 extra for parking not mentioned on booking com 
 the bed the shower the room the price
 bit far from rembrandt where the clubs are
 bare minimum service e g had to collect own newspaper in the morning expected more for the price room service food was tasty but not very hot staff could not provide an aux cable for the radio this was later found in a less than obvious location which staff had not been able to point us to
 remodelling on our floor which created noise and make the elevator area feel like a construction site 
 staff at front desk wasn t particularly helpful in responding to basic questions including about tourism in milan 
 the bath gel and the shampoo was not really universal rather men s fragrance but beside that everything was perfect 
 nothing 
 we struggled to find our room in the maze of corridors 
 mattress is uncomfortable yes the bed is huge but found it hard to get comfy food in hotel restaurant was okay but expensive for what it is especially there breakfast would recommend going on trip adviser and looking for something else local
 no air conditioning
 this is not my first time staying in paris but it will be my last staying at hotel warwick reasons extermily small rooms even for paris standards the bed is only size queen made sleeping uncomfortable the shower was just bad pricy for the level of the hotel
 size of the room 
 wasn t told that i could be seen by others in the bedroom i was asleep and woke up to a suited man infront of me just standing there watching me had to wait till he moved to put blinds down apart from that amazing hotel and will be going back 
 the rooms are very small old and problems with the facilities ac fans are noisy and it takes time to correct it 
 room was small and dark but well furnished 
 metro hub station is strasbourg st denis which is sketchy and in dire need of an upgrade 
 bathroom no walk in shower and small curved bath made it unstable for me to use did have bath but difficulty in getting out safely 
 room next to air conditioning units
 the rooms are very small for 3 people this i unfortunately ruined our stay 
 the bed while comfortable was very squeaky and we were in the second building which was in a different road which we weren t aware of when booked
 room was very poor
 the rooms should have been cleaned each day
 doors bang when closing noisy st night or early morning
 couldn t find a reserved spot to drop car off for valet parking had to pull over on double yellows and go into hotel to find member of staff i m being completely picky here though 
 the walls were thin and you could hear people from other rooms which was not a deal breaker for us but something that was a bit awkward at times 
 no room for chair under desk
 have nothing in particular in mind 
 the breakfast
 i wish i could have sat up in bed more comfortably to watch tv at night 
 the hotel has only 1 2 free televisions you must subscribe to sky if you want to see something on tv this was not in their hotel description i checked again if this is written in the hotel description and i feel like booking com the hotel are telling half of the trut in their description please be clear and fair in your description location far away from the city center even if bignami m5 station is 100 m distance from the hotel it takes you app 40 min get in the center by underground 
 bed was hard and squishy room 620 tutorial for shower and lights would be helpful 
 the breakfast was expensive 17 95 pp so we ate elsewhere also when we asked for a late checkout the girl was a little rude as to the rates as we were there celebrating an occasion it was disappointing 
 bed was too soft air conditioning not effective on 1st night but better for other two nights we stayed we were told that maintenance had been undertaken 
 the building work carried out on 1st floor and we could hear it on 6th floor and bed wasnt comfortable
 the bathroom was a bit small
 tiny room lot of noises
 some white stuff all over wardrobe only one dressing gown asked for another it it never arrived super long wait at check in and nobody said sorry
 we had a fuse blow in the room causing the lighting to fail completely apart from socket lighting we phoned reception and some 10 mins later a porter arrived with a light bulb he realised it was the fuse problem saying he could not do it we were left to get ready with no lighting which consisted of showering then hair drying and makeup to be done hence no one returned to fix the fuse i reported it once again to reception when booking out of hotel to which she replied she would get someone to look at it to which i replied well that s not going to help us now is it 
 dispensers for shampoo conditioner and body lotion very difficlut to use could have used plyers to help squeeze out contents 
 the hotel check in process is very slow and her service was inappropriate we have been waiting for nearly two hours i suggest you to improve your reception now because it s the first impression for your hotel and staff in recption isn t smile i have ever been stay in florence it s impressed 
 no complaints
 parking blicked sink water switching in the shower from cold to very hot
 lovely to hear the church bells of st pauls chime but if you are a light sleeper beware 
 space in bedroom
 ac
 rooms were really small and in comparison to other prices around wasn t too happy 
 it would have loved to be informed about the reconstruction work in this hotel before i booked due to modernization work are large parts of the lobby not in use and the entire lobby has now a hostel like appearance it is not the service but the flair which is missing and for which you book this hotel although the bar is working there is limited service but i am sure that it will be a fabulous place to stay when they finished construction works 
 i can hear noises from hallway and upstairs 
 nothing 
 large hotel so somewhat impersonal 
 door beetween room unlocked
 our booking was messed up the hotel thought we were booking out a day earlier than we had reserved for 
 bed too small despite being a superior room
 room was quite small plus no free internet
 nothing
 wifi very bad
 we would of liked to of seen more english staff and parking could be cheaper
 booked a twin room and arrived with beds together
 long walk up down to our room a
 wifi not available on floor to get connected we were obliged to go down to lobby
 i felt when we were introduced to our room with so many things to take in that the porter could have explained things a little slower and taken more time to show us the facilities in the room all felt a bit rushed 
 they don t trust you as a customer they do an additional pre allocation on your card except for the cost of the room 
 reception was very busy with one receptionist answering the phone and attending to clients so one could not be in too much of a hurry
 no airport shuttle
 nothing
 drinks quite expensive and unfortunately my ipad went missing from my room but by the time i realised i left it in the room the next guest had booked in the staff were very helpful in trying to find it but no luck as of yet
 i come late evening and there no parking i forgot something very expensive in the room and they didn t help me over the phone and send me one snd other person i was very apset this time 
 breakfast a bit poor vegetables not fresh
 minor issue with staff knocking on room at an inappropriate time
 nothing at all 
 breakfast was average at best like most hotels in the uk there are plenty of places nearby that are probably a better alternative 
 we extended the stay for another night directly to the hotel was handled professionally although we had to pay slightly more
 located rather far from the center the easiest way to reach it is by train from milano certosa poor wifi it took me a very long time to connect on the first day and for the second day they actually changed the password unfortunately without any notice messed up my bill at checkout first charged too much then returned too little after i contacted booking com with request to fix it and returned the rest only after my second e mail 
 we missed some sweet cake at breakfast other then that it was good
 price very expensive for one night
 nothing
 parking places are too narrow and it s very difficult to park a car and get in and out of the garage in my opinion they shouldn t charge that much for such parking place 
 how warm the room was
 nothing i can think of 
 slow wifi 
 some of the hard to reach places hadn t been dusted for a while but everywhere else was cleaned properly the decor is a little tired redecoration needed soo 
 the smell of fresh paint in the room gave me a headache
 its a dry hotel 
 maybe a bit old school look
 the quality of food for room service was poor i had hardly warm tasteless pasta it took reception ages to answer the phone from the room 
 the shower could have been more powerful
 nothing at all
 interior decoration
 upgraded the room at check in to what was told a recently renovated part of the hotel tab in shower was broken kettle lid was broken and fell into tea chair in room was squeaky and the night light surrounding room had a very annoying loud buzzy sound the manager at check out did apologise and took a small amount off the upgrade price and said the faults would be looked into 
 steam room not working no shampoo in either ladies or gents spa ladies also had no body wash for a year and a half old hotel some parts of the spa were rusting metal surrounds 
 a man assuming staff letting himself into my room when i was alone in bed made me feel very vulnerable reception had no idea who and housekeeping on landing were female no mirror in room only in bathroom yet hairdryer in room and no plug sockets near bathroom
 the dutty manger she is not helpful and she s only fahaiting with clients i feel i was in police station not in hotel also the internet its was very bad in the rooms with very noisy of working when i ask the dutty manger about the noisy she answered me this not our problem 
 everything
 no changed the broken plastic cup for teeth cleaning
 mr william works in the reception was very unpolite and he doesn t like gay people i never go back and no suggest to anybody
 heating not working properly shower was very poor standard for a 140 room no sky tv
 the hotel was bit expensive and for the price we paid would of thought breakfast would have been included and it wasn t
 we didn t have a door for our bathroom but some kind of closet door it was very nice design wise but not very practical don t know if it s like that on all rooms
 breakfast could have been better for the price
 the bar is not worthy of the name for such a hotel this is a pool bar and nothing more 
 the included dinner meal was very bad 
 strength of the shower wasn t very good 
 the building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings the rooms slightly too small
 the choice of food for breakfast is very poor in 3 hotels is better no toiletries in a room just 1 bottle of shampoo shower gel and a piece of soap no body cream or conditioner or shower cup during 4 days stay the room was hoovered probably once 
 wifi in my room was not stable 
 room has nothing in common with the pictures stuff and is old you come at reception you have a view of all what s behind staff was friendly 
 staff could have been more helpful we went to go for a swim only to have one of your staff trying to get us to buy her book that she had written so we decided not to go for a swim as it was the only way to get away from her we were in another hotel for 2 days before yours only a few miles away in park royal that hotel was excellent for the price we paid sorry was disappointed with the hilton
 nothing 
 staff were a bit offstandish and even though i chose to pay at the hotel on the saturday the hotel had pre authorised the money since monday when i got to the hotel they pre authorised another 50 in case of damages and mini bar use this money was also held for several more days after we checked out although the staff s defence was that it was made clear before we booked it was not i have never encountered this at a hotel before and disliked it very much also it was not up to the standard you would expect from a 4 star hotel 
 kept up all night by a party on our floor the 13th called down to reception but nothing was done about it had a 6am 100 mile bike ride on 20mins sleep worst hotel sleep of my life very unimpressed 
 surprised that dinner wasn t included 
 n a
 couldn t fault it 
 nothing
 a few more bathroom amenities would be nice 
 very cold poor heating room was in basement
 towels
 shower and bathroom were separate room on the small side breakfast nice but not much choice for continental option 
 don t come in if you want a quiet night
 it s a perfect place to live in in joy in milan
 nespresso machine great idea but can we have milk and not creamer powder being brits we like our tea so cant use powdered milk we asked for milk but was told that they did not have any strange reply from room service 
 the location is bad and far first night there were prostitutes near the hotel 
 nothing
 the restaurant and the hotel is unlicensed we couldn t have a drink and we needed one after a long day travelling
 small swimming pool pillows are not comfortable for me all pillows have the same size and quality 
 the water in the pool is very cold 
 internet was slow bed was unconfortable not smiling reception 
 all good 
 too dark in the gilbert scott resturant which made it very difficult to read the menu and wine list similarly in the booking hall resturant but there was a light on the table 
 room too small for family of 3 one person needed to step aside to allow the other to pass by self service cabinet needs more selection arrived after midnight unable to get anything to eat or drink unless we wanted to pay nearly 5 for a can of cola 
 our room had only view of light shaft
 nothing to be better at 
 nothing
 the bathroom only have one small box of tissue paper and also no lotion 
 single beds couldn t be pushed together and were quite narrow fell out of bed twice room was a bit tired and tatty looking
 didn t replace toilet rolls when cleaned
 noisy room 
 the glass open bathroom is nice for a solo traveler or couple but for friends sharing a room it is really not ideal a little bit of skin can be fun but you need to be prepared for it 
 spa is not as fresh modern as it could be
 our taxi could not get through the streets to take us to our hotel and we had to walk several blocks with our luggage because the streets were blocked for the soccer fans 
 we were unable to change air con in room so had to move 
 the food in the twenty two bar was poor room service was expensive
 we only had one bath towel in the bathroom probably an over sight but if that s all to complain about it can t be bad 
 the air conditioner didn t work well i still feel cold 
 there was no hair conditioner like you would expect the pool was cold and should have been heated we visited in october breakfast was a bit too expensive for what it was 
 nothing not to like
 accepted price but could be cheaper
 poor glazing let in a lot of outside noise
 the room was very small we did not have enough space to open a large suitcase the curtains could not block the sun completely so the room was light and the bathroom was not clean with the shower clogged with hair 
 nothing
 wifi was unstable
 the walk to the lift but i m disabled so this won t bother most people 
 very uncomfortable beds 
 nothing
 we felt the breakfast price was too expensive for the amount we had paid for the room so didn t bother
 no complimentary water in the room and you have to call to request a room service menu room service failed to answer so had to order via reception food came quick and was tasty 
 room not get cleaned at all
 nothing
 the staff in the restaurant could have been better and prices for there food and drinks were expensive for mediocre standards
 noisy from the street side the breakfasts were better previously now they have become poorer usually a bit overpriced 
 we arrived early a desk staff told us they could upgrade us to a bigger suite as our room wasn t ready we booked an executive twin anyway it would cost an extra 15 per night for 3 nights i checked their www we had a smaller room than we booked complaining a staff member showed what our suite should of been much larger so we didn t pay the extra he was saying that to everyone that came in early not a good practice 
 clearing up breakfast buffet 30 45 mins prior to end of allocated time 
 nothing
 pool needs a clean not the most salubrious location but interesting safe and we ll catered for 
 bed mattress was not most comfortable probably bec it was old
 the receptionist jaiza was very rude and unhelpful luckily another lady called sameera stepped in and helped us out there was another helpful male receptionist na jaiza was rude to two other couples and we witnessed the great hotel with great location was spoilt by her behaviour the cleaning staff on the other hand was very polite and helpful 
 can be a bit loud given the foot traffic to from amsterdam central when i was there ajax was playing man u for the european cup and it was crazy but good crazy 
 room size
 check in was a painful experience after waiting 25 minutes we were given a room we went to the room and were met with somebody in our bed asleep we waited another 15 minutes and finally got a room with no air con on a hot evening staff member was incredible rude giving us the wrong room because i had a similar surname despite having one of the rarest surnames in the world 
 the area was far from the centre so ended travelling a lot but was worth it for what we got 
 the room was very noisy you could actually hear the elevators moving day and night because the noisy from the elevators came through the pipes of the air conditioning right into the room this was extremely annoying especially at night the breakfast 27 eur was overpriced the furniture in the room looked pretty shabby and out dated considering the amount i paid it was definitely not worth the money 
 the air conditioning was freezing regardless of whether the temperature was adjusted 
 ignorant staff
 we asked for early checking through out booking website we received an email saying that it would be possible when we arrived the male receptionist was not accommodating at all he said we never do that and would not work with us at all he should have at least tried to see what could be done if anything he really was the only disappointing thing about our whe stay 
 not much problem but it would be good if there were more varierities at breakfast
 none
 nothing
 found hair in my bath that was quite clearly not mine bath should have been cleaned properly wardrobe doors were precarious to say the least so i did not use it for fear of them falling out of the frame d cor was out dated and tied lots of road noise from the street below and i was on the 10th floor 
 expensive breakfast
 maintenance works before 9 am woke me up 
 unfortunately the room is very small for the price paid room facilities could also be better however the hotel overall experience is very good i would stary there again 
 it s not in the center but only 20 min walk to the duomo we felt it was worth it 
 the hotel rooms are very old and there is always renovation happening i go to this hotel for the location 
 bus is rare expecially in the late evening 
 restaurant on friday night was limited but the food was good
 nothing
 poor insulation to other rooms uncomfortable pillows no air conditioning system no bar too small double bed room
 we booked a room for two and we must have done something wrong because at the end it stated only for one i would have never booked in this hotel because the price is a slam in the face for a sole guest the price offered is okay for two people this hotel is not a 4star nor should it sell tself as such 
 expensive for what you get
 rude service maids which is v important in a 5 property pool needed to be heated facilities in spa steam room and sauna just need adapting as not as powerful
 this is in a great location but is not a 5 hotel
 being in the other building without any facilities and the location wasn t as good as i hoped not worth how much i paid for it
 breakfast didn t have any fresh fruit slalad
 breakfast and food was expensive also breakfast on sunday morning was too late for us 
 unfortunate that the swimming pool screen was only half working nothing else to fault great hotel great stay 
 no parking but the web site said that there was parking if i had know there was no parking i would not have booked the shower did not work at all and it was very difficult to get a ready for the event that i had travelled to the reason for my stay the receptionists tried their best and did find me somewhere to shower in the end in another bedroom that i could use just for the shower before the next guest booked into it they were fully booked and i could not move rooms the key cards did not work all the time and i had to keep getting it reprogrammed and no it was no where near my phone when i spoke to the manager he really was not interested and wanted to know what my solution would be as if it was for me to resolve and finally once checked out i could not get to the pick up area to collect my bags as the laundry van was blocking the front entrance for about 20 minutes in an area that is crawling with traffic wardens i won t be staying again even though the location was good 
 the telephone in my room did not work 
 nothing
 being checked in to someone else s room
 room quite small no view of tower bridge
 old and past its prime breakfast is full english watery orange juice and jelly o passing or jam threadbare carpets and shaking rattling elevators
 nothing
 rooms were dated and small
 although previously asked to be accommodated in a heated room the second time we stayed in the cold the room has no air conditioning and it was really cold
 a bit overpriced and the hotell needs a facelift looks a bit run down 
 n a
 having to leave very bittersweet
 the water flowing from my tap was rusty and smelling so bad but nest day they fixed the problem quickly rooms are little bit small but enough for one person 
 expensive and the hot breakfast food was kept in dishes that untouchably hot 
 air conditioning couldn t be adjusted 
 the room was too small
 the single room was rather small and the bed too not uncomfortable but still a bit tight 
 no food available on evening only pizza delivery the lasagne and strawberry cheesecake were awful breakfast in the hotel was badly organised and poor quality and more expensive when bought in advance reception were offering breakfast for 7 if bought on arrival 
 the room is too warm and the air condition does not work good 
 nothing
 several things are stylish and trendy looking but not very functional the sink in the room is curved and low at one side so water splashes out over the side the shower echoes the shape of the hotel a bizarre glass tube in the middle of the room which may not sit well with business travelers sharing a room or others uncomfortable with displaying their body the plates at breakfast were an oval shape on a raised base but they tilt when you cut something with knife and fork the coffee table in the room had a very small round base with a big round top so that it continually threatened to topple over and smash the huge round window facing over the highway 
 paying to use the pool is terrible and it s not like it s advertised
 gym is really just 3 machines in a tiny room 
 too tide
 every time i stay at this hotel there is always stains on the carpets in the room the decor finishings in the corridors seem only half finished and mdf quality the staff are stand offish and don t seem to care how is this hotel rated 5 star the only thing going for it is the location 
 it would be nice if it was slippers in the room
 reception clerk mr redzoan is a liar and wouldn t take responsibility for his actions before the hotel s reservation centre i enquired about the possibility of changing my reservation but clearly it wasn t worth it so i decided to keep it as it was mr redzoan knew this he was standing in front of me with booking com on the phone when we all agreed to keep the reservation as it was still they considered it changed and charged me more than 600 on my credit card without my authorization and that was for one night at the reception they simply said contact our reservation centre tomorrow monday the reservation centre never replied my email fortunately booking com did the right thing and reimbursed me i hope they got their money back from this hotel and i hope they penalized the hotel be careful don t trust this hotel 
 the view room711 from our room was straight into debenhams staff quarters 
 it s all good
 the room got a little room got a little warm even with air con
 room was a little old fashioned and the shower over the bath was on the wrong wall making it impossible to stand under due to the narrowness of the bath 
 couldnt really find anything to complain on if anything for a bit more money would have liked a bigger room but not moaning 
 the cleanliness of the room executive room carpet didn t appear to have been really cleaned for awhile i don t think i should have needed to have washed the crockery on a daily basis after the room had been serviced breakfast was a disappointment connected to a garfunkels small buffet and cooked selection the hotel didn t appear friendly at all only one member in the reception area smiled let alone said hi 
 the price plus the attitude of the staff i landed in the night around 1am and guy asked me to prepay for first night the machine didn t work the first time and he immediately said that he can t give me the room though the issue was with his machine card worked in the 2nd attempt though but he created panic and asked immediately to leave very horrible experience 
 the rooms is bit small
 we shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed that was fine unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door my wife and i slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light i thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed seemed like a bad layout plan the pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it 
 small property calm and quite good location and friendly staff 
 distance to town not local to any anemities
 the rooms are adequate
 layout of the hotel
 noise from room above sounded like renovations couldn t get the room warm
 i worry about the danger of the shower being located in the bath and the fact that there is a shower curtain rather than a solid glass door i had trouble adjusting the hot water to the right temperature for the shower i also couldn t work out how to open the safe using the given instructions otherwise all worked well for me price is a factor and this compares well with other hotels close by 
 the room was slightly sparse with little in the region of facilities like a hairdryer or enough hangers in the closet
 the wifi was working very poorly when it was working at all
 no free internet
 nothing 
 all is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower likewise bedroom was not clean 
 room size is small although room had all facilities
 room was dated and had a damp smell
 i have stayed in the hotel a number of times but was disapointed in the bedroom this time it was very small for what you were paying for 
 small room
 not really clean wifi slow inconsistent room size pretty small personnel is rather different from very careful and helpful to absolutely formal
 hotel is further away from kings cross than the advert implies 
 it s far away from the doumo
 the hotel was a old hotel sort of semi renovated but not to its best my bathroom was leaking sewage water from the upper floor at 5 am in the morning it s a good thing we were checking out that time as the receptionist doesn t seem to have a solution nor even a care or a apology for what happened disappointing end to an average 3 star hotel not four there is minimal amenities in the bathroom rooms are very tiny the internet not fast the location of the hotel is right next to a subway stop but in hindsight i would ve stayed closer to an attraction rather than having to spend alot of time travelling as paris is a large city 
 gare du nord area can be a bit noisy at night 
 there was nothing i didn t like 
 no bathtub
 everything was great
 breakfast was over priced and wasn t nice to eat everything was covered in grease 
 the sofa bed was quite uncomfortable as right across the centre it had a very hard bar of metal digging in your back which we sat down on by accident a few times the keys kept stopping working we had to ask ours to be changed 3 times 
 the room size was small and there is no view from this particular room but everything else was lovely most city rooms are small there was plenty of space for 2 
 there was a small issue with concierge bringing our luggage up to the room as reception had forgotten to notify them but the professionalism of the staff when i phoned them from the room was superb it really was no hassle at all to us and only a very light complaint well not really a complaint we all make mistakes concierge phoned us then the manager phoned us shortly after to see if we were happy which we were as they treated us well
 no breakfast included 
 the bathroom needs renovation in sight parking was expensive 18 euros per night we reserved a triple room with 3 single beds but when we arrived we found out that they only had double rooms with an extra bed added in and literally squeezed in the middle of the room 
 no free wi fi time for a rethink 
 unruly kids slamming doors running in corridor tilll late at night very slow elevators rooms not ready on arrival at 13 00pm
 the air conditioning in the room was very loud and couldn t sleep through it and without it the room was very warm 
 we felt the drinks were a bit pricey
 dining room packed forb fast so ordered from roomservice food was cold and had obviously been sitting around a long time scrambled eggs were rubbery some mould on underside of bath mat i turned it upside down on the side of the bath but it wasn t changed the room was obviously in need of redecoration 
 it took long time to receive the baggage and ask for the taxi arrangement on leaving apart from this everything was great 
 breakfast was average 
 bar nowhere to put my case very little in mini bar 
 hallways look institutional breakfast is way over priced but with the mall right there other options that are better and more affordable are easily accessible 
 room very small 
 non alcoholic mini bar fruit bowl dreadful 3 guests in room but 1 pair slippers 1 dressing gowm 2 cups for tea coffee
 the breakfast poor there is always bad smokes near the elevators
 the carpet in the room 
 the location is not very good but there is a subway station at 3 4 minutes
 the staff though helpful about facilities in the hotel didn t know anything about the local area we didn t like the entrance to the hotel through a pub s smoking garden 
 none
 stayed for 3 days and there were repairs being carried out on our floor constant drilling throughout our stay very disappointing also we were accused of smoking in our room when we dont smoke and had only just had a shower and sprayed deoderant and hairspray first member of staff that accused us of smoking knocked the door and walked straight into our room without waiting for us to answer the door i was naked in the bathroom second member of staff that accused us was rude unprofessional very disappointed 
 wasnt the quietest of hotels i could hear cars from the road outside i could also hear doors banging probably other guests and what sounded like trolleys not sure if it impacted my sleep at all 
 food was average booking com extra charged me by 50 pounds
 sober october
 416 22 stay for 3 night charge me 476 22 why charge me more and did not return the deposit to me
 the hotel was nice the staff was great but the rooms and hallways were so cramped i felt like in a uk hotel and the hotel it self tried so hard to be lavish and four star y that it was cringeworthy at times from the emotional shower in the bathroom to the dozens of vanity fair magazines spread on tables in the cramped corridor not a major minus but still 
 the fact that the kettle in the room was not emptied and the fact that it contained tea leaves the area where the hotel is situated is surrounded by hot food takeaways and the only real choice outside of the hotel to eat is weatherspoon s the overground station at cricklewood is very close but the underground is approximately one mile away at kilburn parking is available at a reduced rate of 15 00 per day at the hotel 
 not too many restaurants and caf s around the eiffel tower
 if you travel arround by foot it s a bit away from turist places but they are easiely rechable by near by metro station 
 breakfast a bit pricy at 32 euroes pr person if you do not have the breakfst included 
 the bed was so uncomfy
 the reception was very unknowing about lots of things for each question they needed to check on the internet every 24 hours you needed to pick up new codes for the internet connection not very customer friendly on the 2nd morning the girl at breakfast told us we had continental breakfast but we paid for english breakfast 
 very small room with view of a wall not good
 room 
 we could hear people in the other rooms talking even when they were not talking loud the beds were on wheels not stable moving when the occupant is moving not comfortable 
 would have been better if i could have paid for any expenses at checkout rather than during as this did lead to a dissapointing room service cancellation 
 rooms very small
 no hot water in the morning of my second stay
 we did not like the lifts you always need to use the card before pressing the button lift were always full so people should be squeezing to get the card inserted lift were stopping in each floor so to get to or from 8 floor you should spend 10 minutes in the hot and airless lift 
 the room was outdated and things where broken the room was very hot so gave us broken sleep 
 walls and ceilings were a bit thin so you could hear furniture being moved above toilet flushing and shower when in the bathroom and people in the corridors however not a very busy hotel so this was not too much of a problem 
 breakfast is not worth the money we paid 
 the wifi was spotty and slow
 bedroom rather small dull 
 all good
 they gave me a new room with was nice but no opening window no fridge they moved me rooms with was terrible the bed u rolled into middle they new i suffered with spinal damage and severed nerve damage to my left side i had to share bed with my 11 year old so i did not sleep i have been home for a day with i had to spend in bed as there bed had trapped my nerve please don t stay if u want 4 this hotel is 2 
 breakfast could have been better bread for toast was a bit stale 
 the check in was the worst of all they didn t give us the rooms we booked almost 6 months ago we asked for connected rooms and after a discussion we had them but to my surprise one of them was disabled room i was very angry in my home it is a crime to take disabled park and they made me sleep in theirs the second day they moved us to the rooms we booked and they were perfect but not connected every one day and another the cards blocked the tv channels were very boring only british and chinese there has been no varieties
 they told us there s continental breakfast but you had to pay for it and we didn t know
 although the hotel was in a lovely area and near to greenwich centre it was noisy i understand that the building is most probably listed and the windows were single glazed because of this i was also aware when i booked that the bar would be noisy this wasn t an issue as we arrived late sorry 
 service in the rooftop bar
 room was way too warm even though i was on the ground floor and had turned down the thermostats couldn t open the windows both my partner and i kept stubbing our toes when leaving the bathroom you couldn t see the tv screen when soaking in the tub all you could see was the reflection of the ceiling and last but not least the taps in the bathroom didn t run cold and there was no water in the mini fridge so i could not have a cold glass of water 
 poor executive lounge hardly any variety miserable staff 
 in spite of the mass sporting event on the weekend and unlike the novotel cardiff the hilton made no provision for an early breakfast for the large proportion of guests attending the event at the last minute water and bananas were laid on considering i d paid a rate including breakfast i was aggrieved that the only way to get it would have been to pay 20 for a room service option 
 we are on holiday out all day exhausted from sight seeing back to hotel not been cleaned no tea or coffee to make a drink toiletries non existent because no one cleaned the room for three days until my husband went down to foyer and asked nicely for it to be done will not stay here again in total we had eleven days stay beginning of june and from the 23 rd 29 th
 bad service in my room no water no towels no clean bed sheets for the very first time
 a lot of green colors in the room and retro style curtains 
 horrible
 room was available at 1800 
 spa treatments and mini bar in room a little over priced
 bed sheets had spikey bits of real cotton in how could you very bijou in size all we needed for a crash pad though 
 the beds are too hard 
 nothing we would certainly come again if we could come to barcelona
 scary open elevator 
 a microwave would have been nice and a kettle for those who don t drink coffee you can request a small kettle at reception 
 there was nothing negative
 omlette at breakfast for example not free of charge usually a good choice to have a swift breakfast when travelling with a tight business agenda adjustment of room temperature was only possible in one direction cooling possible heating not wardrobe not enough space for longer clothes e g wintercoats
 o
 the room was a bit small but being in town for such a short time who needs to stay in the room for purposes other than for sleeping 
 nothing
 everything specially the front desk
 check in was an hour late hotel restaurant was pricey
 to start with the room was tiny i literally had to crawl over my husband if i needed to use the bathroom at night there obviously are problems with hot water and water pressure the bathroom was as tiny as in a 3 star parisian hotel we also didn t like the service there was supposed to be a concierge service but even reaching the reception by telephone was a pain night receptionists were far from being helpful we even failed to send a postcard as were advised to go to the post office and do it by ourselves think it s kind of mean taking into account the hotel is supposed to be luxurious 
 nil
 i had no concerns with hotel 
 blood stains on sheets room not cleaned with dirt and dust in most places window was not closing proberly so noise was an issue and walls were paper thin where we could hear the conversations of our neighbors very disappointed would not recommend this hotel
 average waiting time at the check in
 windows are not open and breakfast is poor 
 there is nothing substantial at all to dislike the breakfast buffet could be a little more substantial but continental breakfasts are what they are also there are so many amazing things to eat in paris going light on breakfast is probably a sensible thing 
 room is a bit dark 
 rooms and hotel in general is very dated wouldn t have paid more than what i did for it 
 not being able to open a window for air don t like sleeping with air condition and the room got very stuffy a better supply and presentation of tea and coffee in the room something to put used teabags on 
 room rates expensive as were the hotel restaurant and bar
 a little bit too noise much of what was going on outside floor adjacent room doors slamming nothing from inside of the rooms inner courtyard 
 shower went boiling hot for no reason half a dozen times and was very painful 
 nothing
 breakfast lounge
 restaurant staff wasn t nice interior terrace smoking place close at 10pm
 the breakfast was lovely but the meal from room service was not good soggy sandwiches not enough vegetarian options i was offered a green salad or pasta
 nothing
 the mattress was rather lumpy and the room was very basic e g a hanging space instead of a wardrobe and no drawers to put things in this could have been a bit of a problem if my stay was longer than one night 
 the pool is tiny but with miles of beach down the road it s not a problem 
 our bathroom was really really small
 we both found the bed and pillows not very comfortable mind you that could be that we are used to a tempur mattress and pillows expensive for just a room and no breakfast 
 the address provided cannot be captured on gps as all roads to the location are closed please provide alternate address to the hotel i took additional 1 hr to reach the hotel owing to incorrect address
 shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler 
 everything was good
 our bedroom was rather small and very hot the shower would comfortably accommodate a small child but not an adult
 instant coffee in rooms is dreadful 1 of the uht milk was separated and off 
 the room rates are overpriced
 nothing
 staff are not that much helpful really very average breakfast for what they charge not very good value for money in general
 nothing
 breakfast is extremely poor wifi in some rooms not working at all i had to go to the lobby to connect
 nothing
 hotel has no business center would very helpful to guests if they provided one or two computer stations and a printer it was awkward to have to e mail front desk so they could print a pages for me i must say they were extremely helpful in doing this for me 
 cannot complain about any thing 
 more natural light in the room and easier car spaces to park in 
 we booked a queen room but it was 2 single mattress pushed together very poor asked the manager about it he said they are all like that but changed rooms for us another staff member said it is not normal for a bed like that think someone was telling lies 
 breakfast was not worth added cost should have been free
 very expensive cost of room plus having to then pay for breakfast babysitting service also quite expensive 
 breakfast bar remain open longer i got lost so came in the early hours and slept late when i went for breakfast it was closed at 10 a m also the restaurant overall we had an excellent two nights 
 the price of the breakfast cheaper to eat out
 the room was a little small 
 a room without a view my window opened on to a wall i could touch by extending my arm and the closed the roof terrace for a private party so many better options at half the price
 cold room
 stop serving food even though the menu said 24 hours
 the price of a glass of wine in the reception bar was very high
 the breakfast room was small but they had a lovely range of food available it was slightly too warm for comfort in the breakfast room but it didn t spoil anything for us
 size of the rooms
 nothing 
 everything
 we had gone out for the night and someone had come in and left shower products on our bed and took away the cushions from our bed this isn t a problem but a warning to the customers that this would happen would of been nice or even bring the products while we was still in the room the other thing is the price of parking i understand its london but at least the hotel should give their staying customers some sort of discount the price of things in the room should also be adjusted e g 6 for a handful of haribo sweets
 the receptionist was abosolutely rude 
 concierge were often not present when i returned for my luggage so had to keep going back 
 our misinterpretation that there was a pool but this was next door in the adjacent park plaza hotel 
 the breakfast is too expencive and the ingrediens had a poor standard 
 room is beyond tiny smallest i have ever stayed in
 guests are given a paper card at reception with the room number and i had to show it every time i came back to hotel this was a bit odd 
 everything it is just a truly awful hotel and i will never stay here again avoid at all costs plenty of nicer hotels to choose from in london 
 nothing
 the room that i reserved from booking it s not the same when i arrived the hotel and i make upgrade paid more to be the room suitable with me and my wif no wifi appear to my room and i called them more times but without any action
 all good 
 it was a box room under the stairs with no windows and 2 tiny single beds
 the room bathroom were quite small there was a less than adequate shower screen so water all over the floor
 the gym equipment is very basic
 nothing it was all great
 nothing 
 farther from city center than i thought 
 toilet too small room little small too many d ors to open to walk to the room with luggage
 nothing
 good but same breakfast all days we stayed
 hotel looks very tired in the bedrooms
 shower box floods bathroom floor
 a bit noisy on the first night due to a wedding reception 
 nice lobby 
 the location of the hotel is not ideal the area is very rundown and a little scary when there is a security guard on the hotel breakfast room door and in the car park the hotel is very big and impersonal and was very busy even in january 
 wifi a ridiculous price air conditioning in room not working properly to be fair though we didn t report it so can t really complain 
 very small room and bed size
 bathroom was smelly couldn t control air condition from room this used to be a great comfortable hotel centrally located and great value for money don t know why it s standards have deteriorated won t stay here again unless some upgrades and are made to this once great hotel 
 not many restaurants or shops nearby 
 window couldn t t open on the room
 the pillows smelled a bit fousty 
 no bar 
 the bedrooms were a bit tatty old fashioned dusty bedroom and air con didn t work 
 the bathroom was not at all good the shower was difficult to use properly the room was quite cold and the basin did not hold water as it should 
 few options to eat
 4 star hotel does not have restaurant to serve breakfast they serve it at lobby very small tight place dirty tables 4 apples from days ago only one single banana 5 single grapes waited 20 min for hot water to have r tea no air ventilation in the bathroom very small bedroom food smelly corridors during cooking they ask your credit as a guarantee for room and mini bar no trust to the customer i would not stay there again 
 no free water in the room
 quicker to use stairs than wait for the elevators
 perhaps a little too clinical generic if you are looking for a bit of london character 
 was unable to sleep due to faulty air conditioning unit within the room which staff were unwilling to assist or relocate the manager only got involved upon leaving the hotel and was also was not helpful and only used my negative experience as an attempt to try and get me to pay to stay again do not stay here 
 a bit slow the check in because i was tired room s carpet was a bit used 
 staff at the pool terrace was kind but inefficient staff at reception was cold and not very helpful serious need for more hooks or towel racks in the bathroom room not as shown no balcony rather dark with a musty smell booking com site states enjoy a free welcome drink upon arrival which we did not get overall pricey for what we got i feel we had the cheap room and service to match 
 a lot of everyday staff cannot speak english chambermaids etc 
 very small accommodations tried to make the most of the space but smallee rooms than even the typical paris hotel 
 no tea coffee facility
 room design resulted in limited storage space no milk provided for tea coffee facilities in room
 had a issue with our room the manhole collapsed so we had to change room
 seems all rooms didn t work well for me the 1st one room 506 the heater didn t work the second one 509 was very small the last one 319 was something wrong with the electricity it went off the whole room in the night so i had to bring my baby out from the room 
 air conditioning stopped working and noise from adjoining room disturbed my relaxation 
 property is a bit dated and needs refurbishing corridors had a strange plastic odor shuttle from airport is advertised no such service exists time wasted at airport looking for shuttle queen bed not comfortable sunken in the middle inside facing rooms a bit dingy 
 tv set was not working the room is very small
 hard bed pillow too soft only 1 had better sleep in half price hotel in vienna only cnn in english all tv in german poor for today and luxury hotel no one to make fresh omelets confusing layout of hotel e g check out with luggage passes through people eating breakfast 
 nowt all good
 the location of the hotel made my partner and i feel uncomfortable
 no parking facilities no a c in bedroom noisy construction work starts early 7 30 am we had to lug our bags about 50 meters to the front door because it is on a bus lane and we did not know about the side entrance 
 understaffed at breakfast time
 tiny detail sure just an oversight but no teaspoons with the tea coffee making facilities
 hotel going through renovation so gym was closed as well as the bar 
 we wished that the hotel have a restaurant from the hotel itself although you have the french restaurant you should have an english one 
 the location of the hotel is in a really not safe area though it is 5 minutes walk to a metro station but strongly recommend people not to take the hotel since you can get a way better location and way better hotel with the same price i was staying in park plaza riverbank with exactly same price in the first two nights but way nicer area and location also way better rooms and services unfortunately they didn t have the other nights available since i booked too late the receptionist who checked us in had the worst attitude ever they locked our luggage and suitcases in the room the second night since our credit card didn t work out and they refused to take our dollars as deposit when we went back to hotel at 11pm no upfront notice via phone number or email we left at the check in form they insisted that we shall either go to the atm at 11pm at the not safe area or we shall try to make the credit card work an upfront mail about this during the day would be nice very unpleasant stay and not gonna stay there any more not recommending others either actually this worst stay ever even got us really bad impression on holiday inn brand it was the first time in holiday inn and the last time will not stay in holiday inn brand hotels any more 
 breakfast is boring hope it be improved next time
 smoking at the pool area
 roomes dated flaking paint no biscuits small wardrobe plumbing makes terrible sounds when other people use there bathrooms keeps you awake or wakes you up in the middle of the night just very very tied there are better priced hotels in the same location 
 nothing
 room space a bit tight and we were in the basement 
 the ceiling of our bathroom began leaking one day we went out all day after telling the concierge in the morning about it when home around dinner there was just a ladder and half done work all over the bathroom must have been 1 of the 237 holidays in europe with no work we went to dinner and asked if it would be finished or at least cleared out but when we got home around 1am or so no progress was made so we fortunately got another room but after some skepticism and eye rolling about how high and mighty we must have thought ourselves for needing a new room despite the workzone bathroom we at least we re moved 
 hairdryer didnt work
 couldn t connect to wifi bit noisy next to lift shaft 
 bar staff can t pour a pint 
 overall the accommodations were very comfortable not quite a complaint but we thought that the bathroom was a bit small 
 a lot of things the service was horrendous i booked for 2 adults 2 children but was not allowed to open a sofa bed even after paying a supplement for a room upgrade because for some reason the room i booked was only for 2 peoples
 staff could be more welcoming and smiling 
 the room is not really soundproof luckily our neighbors weren t very noisy the closet wardrobe was too small not enough space to organize everything if you are staying for a longer period of time the bathroom although was quite modern the door left a gap between the door and the glass wall not much privacy 
 room was very very dusty walls were paper thin so we could hear everything 
 the bed was narrow
 for the price this hotel is kind of drab the facilities are limited during the stay the ac didn t work so well 
 as usual getting in and out the parking is a problem you have to bother one of the staff to open the door to the hotel for you coming along from the reception each time you go and come can be easily solved with a door key 
 the staff was not willing to help no gym
 bed was very uncomfortable 
 no power outlets next to the bed on friday night there might be some noise if you want to sleep with your window open but if you close it and turn on the ac it s all good very good isolation
 rude staff awful restaurant
 could do with a mirror in the bedroom near to an electric socket to use the hairdryer 
 they they couldn t be bothered to do any thing for him all the hotels i ve been in go out off there way for a special birthday but not this hotel
 only one little fault your pillows are not very comfortable and maybe the see through doors in the bathroom could be uncomfortable for some people
 the room was ok but does need updating perhaps a bit of redecorating 
 the view of my room bad housekeeping services like missing tissue paper none bottle of water the second day and third day of staying dirty towels remain in the washroom after housekeeping service
 everything was wonderful 
 the room must be cleaned and under the sofa 
 breakfast seems to be a bit expensive for what it serves 
 open space with shutters between bedroom and bathroom i like a bit more privacy
 disappointed that the executive lounge was not open 
 room was rather small wifi 10 a day the whole hotel looks a bit rundown and i found every day i stayed a very long black hair in the bathroom i have short blond hair 
 
 the elvator wasnt working most of the time and the order was being for one person not three as we ordered probaly a problem of the booking site
 nothing very pleasant staff and great service overall
 no desk for working in the basement breakfast was with very cheap products and not too much offered
 due to the location we had to travel for meals if we didn t want to eat at the hotel supplies in the room were light on and we had to ask for extra tea bags all the time terrible shampoo provided and the room servicing was not great we stayed for a week and the sheets did not get changed and the bed was poorly made in the dining room the staff were not good at clearing tables or replenishing stocks as the morning breakfast was happening 
 the room is too small facility is out of date just like budget hotel 
 front end of hotel looks very glamorous however the reception bar and in particular my room was very cold looking and small i requested to relocate but no joy poor nights sleep as a result of constant police ambulance sirens 
 housekeeping knocking on the door at 8 15am no food available at 10 20pm
 one thing i would like to mention is that there is some weird systef of elevators we were waiting for so long till elevator came breakfest time but it was full so we were waiting for another then we rather went downstairs 
 they clean the room on very late afternoon
 3 oclock check in would be better earlier and a earlier check out as bags are being stored for you so no need for room after 10 00 on check out day
 room very small compared to photos breakfast staff unfriendly and not very helpful
 love the place the only thing i didn t like was that there wasn t much room i the lobby since there was so many other non guest there and i was hoping for more secluded places and open fires like in los angeles and maybe a nicer roof bar but that s just me being picky 
 heating didn t work and was cold towels were unclean sofa was hard
 the self reception being a do it yourself on pcs the size of the room very small and the room all so digitalized and trendy that it felt overdone somewhat impersonal and cold all in all i felt a bit claustrophobic in the room 
 25 per drink of whisky and ginger ale in the sky bar one barman particularly sleazy 
 the steps coming down the lobby with heavy lugguage
 breakfast too expensive 
 opposite a hostel that was noisy late into the evening wifi reception poor room was clean but dated toilet flush fell off wall 
 although the bathroom was of a top standard the entrance to the bathroom is a glass partition with a large gap rather than a door this meant the bathroom was basically in the same room as the bed giving you had no privacy when using the facilities everything can be heard clearly throughout the room the pool was excellent and would be great in summer but we were a bit disappointed it wasn t heated during the spring months we visited in april when the weather was warm enough to sunbathe but the pool was ice cold and put people off using it 
 in the morning there were unpleasant construction noises i couldn t sleep over 8 15 am without complementary cosmetics in the bathroom just a universal shower gel 
 the room was very dirty looked clean but under the bed you could see it had not been hoovered for ages i was very unhappy 
 terrible wifi connection in room 
 the room they put us in was tiny couldn t even walk around to one side of the bed 
 english breakfast
 for a 5 i would have expected free biscuits in the room mini bar very expensive 
 breakfast needs massive improvement to justify its price
 room was non smoking but stunk of cigarettes and the aircon didn t work we also found that people put their towels on the sun beds at 9am and wouldn t return to the pool until midday meaning there was hardly any room by the pool the pool also had a playlist on repeat all day every day with a total of 5 songs made it quite unbearable bar was good and bar staff really friendly but basics like water and coffee were too expensive spa staff were incredibly rude and snappy would not recommend the spa to anyone 
 nothing
 bad room service no water given if not ask
 breakfast was poor considering what they charge 
 triumph of style over function the funkiness translates into impracticality in the room curved table tops mean only a small area is useable everything else slides off not enough storage space or comfortable seating lights are a law unto themselves and the loo is in a cupboard not enough sockets for charging electronic equipment 
 the places is tatty and falling to pieces so 1990 contemporary come on spend some money and refurbish it 3 star with 5 star price 
 limited price information
 expensive breakfast 20 pp compared to beautiful restaurants in radiys of 80m restaurant staff not so pleasant just one woman no heating lobby bar sitting not so nice as the rest of hotel simple pool with skimmer
 rooms too small for confort noisy easy to hear the activity in the adjacent room expensive 
 old and scratched bath missing any equipment in kitchen glass knife etc poor breakfast in 4 hotel
 small room size
 breakfast not that good
 noise they gave me 1st floor although i asked for good view
 being up so high i did request if possible a lower room as my fiance suffers from vertigo
 i booked a queen room and was provided with a twin disabled accessible room not impressed i raised it with staff when i arrived and was told i was unable to move and raised it again at checkout and was simply told they were sorry not what i expect from a supposed 4 star hotel 
 the space of the room is very very small for three although it was a triple room not worth the money
 the rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny but clean 
 i didn t like the number of days it takes for the guest linens or beddings to be changed especially when have a family 
 no facilities to iron any clothing
 my wife being told she looked tired upon check in way to burst our bubble 
 small room
 room in need of refurbishment 
 breakfast not being included in a room price of 147
 we loved everything it was a fabulous trip
 the maid woke us up at 8 30 am sunday morning by knocking loudly and then entering the room without our permission after a very late night this wake up call ruined our day 
 car parking is 13 gbp per day this is unsense which is really far away from the centre of london 
 we only stayed for one night however we had a member of staff walk into our room at 8 am i am assuming this was housekeeping however since we were checking out in three hours we saw this as pointless and quite rude there wasn t a knock or announcement the staff member just walked in 
 staff not really helpful they will not take care of your car the garage recommended is not the closest one i got burned twice in the shower by unstable hot water breakfast just average 
 location of the hotel is not well covered by cellular network wifi only works in the very small lobby area 
 i didn t like the interior of the bathroom the shower was very hard to work to get the right temperature and pressure we ordered room service and the pizza was horrible and cost us 17 in total which is a rip off i also think check out time at 11am is too early i also think after paying 109 for one night you should be able to use the pool area i was all set to go until i found out even hotel guests have to pay 20 each to get into this area 
 the staff were helpful and the breakfast very good
 the room description was complete fiction and the facilities for example the gym were basic 
 the breakfast was abit dissappointing didn t really have much to offer
 main road on front of hotel
 had to ask for a room delivery 3 times got it finally the next day
 very unhappy about the breakfast the pastries were covered with fruit flies and i am afraid my buffet breakfast was cold the manager was very apologetic and gracious but in an hotel with the good reputation that the renaissance has these events were not acceptable 
 half depth elevator
 this hotel doesent have bell boy to help heavy staff passengers there is pne bell boy and he is always busy we reached hotel on march 25th 2 pm our luggages came to my room 2 20 our checking out was 8 am on 28th because we had flight at 10 30 am unfourtunately nobody was there to bring down my 2 suitcases and i had to take by myself when i told teciption man that why nobody here to help he told me we have 2 bell boys one is in vacation one willcome between 9 10 itold him its very bad for uou hotel reputation he told yes and you can report its really ridiculous this hotel doesent have bell boy but take lot of money from the guests
 no kettle in the room as a solo traveller the dining room and bar were too busy for me to want to spend time there the rest of the hotel though was very tranquil 
 i was initially given room 052 which was right next to the main entrance so the traffic noise woke me early on the first morning when i complained i was moved but that room had no hot water the following morning had to take a cold shower as i needed to be at an early appointment apparently there was no hot water in that part of the hotel 
 horrible very small rooms no toiletries or mini bar and extremely noisy neighbours who despite complains to reception were shouting and screaming until 4am in early morning
 house keeping need improvement in all aspects same little soap was hardly changed checked out at 6 am and reception told me there is no one to help me to bring down our nine suit cases i personally took them down and while reception staff were watching me no no bothered to help me at all first time to see these reception staff in my ten days stay 
 room size is smaller than i expected complementary water only on the first day staff are very formal no door man the entrance of the hotel is not convenient at all the taxi stopped in a distance were i have to carry my luggage alone since no body will help you this might have no relation but i hated the air freshener or whatever they were using in the lobby its too strong
 that there was no bar to go have a drink was disappointed with the no alcohol thing and not a lot of options on menu
 door closers too strong causing them to bang loudly but also due to inconsiderate guests 
 that i had to leave
 the bath was dangerous very high sided not easy to get out of without slipping no mat provided we are far from disabled very active but both found this a accident point
 only thing we had an issue with was the fact they took a pre authorisation transaction which was nearly double the amount of the room which then left me overdrawn don t know why they took the money in the first place or tell me what they were doing 
 nothing 
 the room was cold
 they give me the room at 5 cock but they make upgrade to junior suite
 upgraded but to a smoky room on smoking floor we had to change room back to non smoking service at breakfast poor food cold staff could not cope 
 nothing
 charged for milk for room 1 euro 80 for enough to make 4 small cups of coffee thought this was really poo especially as we had to almost beg to get any milk at all 
 a bit far from city center breakfast was not included room rate and also toilet accessories was not there 
 rooms a bit small but expected in amsterdam 
 no facilities
 bedroom double glazing was poor lots of noise from traffic and demonstrations outside probably a side or rear facing room would have been quieter 
 room wasn t ready for check in at 2pm had to wait for this to be ready in bar complementary drink would have been welcomed but not offered 
 a kensington hotel should be a place of serenity and relaxation at park grand london kensington guests can relax in the elegant and chic surroundings and feel at home while away from home the beautifully appointed guest rooms are designed with the utmost attention and embellished with plentiful amenities we were informed that we had been given free upgrade by the receptionist on arrival only to find that we had been put in rooms below ground level my room had a man hole cover in it and rather unpleasant odour there was no natural day light with no window and the booking did not included breakfast my colleague immediately asked for a new room with a window and was moved to a room in a far reaching part of the hotel with a window but not much of an improvement use again not likely unless i can be assured of a natural above ground accommodation our perception was that the receptionist knew the rooms were not very nice but tried to counter that by stating we had been given these free upgrades prior to seeing the rooms 180 for a dingy dungeon not very happy 
 not enough power points in the room and a swimming pool would of been nice 
 bedside lamps dim
 nothing
 nothing
 i only appreciated a kettle or a coffee maker on the room 
 the breakfast was poor in fact disappointing
 hotel is expensive for what is included wifi is horrible unless you want to pay for faster wifi bathroom extremely small for a junior suite the volume on the tv randomly would turn off 
 black colour scheme in bathroom difficulty in locating position of hotel in piazza on arrival because only signage hidden behind columns 
 we booked three rooms and the rooms were very far apart we even had to take a different elevator to get to one of our rooms that made it difficult for a family 
 however the same breakfast also gives reason for some severe criticism the americano coffee in large containers is very unworthy of a country with such a coffee culture 
 aircon not very good 
 our only quibbles were that the room was very hot we were at the back end of a heatwave in london and the air conditioning was very very noisy and the windows did not open at all also strangely the supplies of toiletries provided did not include a shower gel or hand soap 
 rip off prices over christmas and then error in final bill
 all good
 no bar or restaurant but plenty nearby including the phoenix pub and wagamamas you can also create your own room service with the kitchen i m sure deliveroo could help 
 room was too hot but staff moved us to a cooler room 
 products in the bathroom were very basic 
 walls are on the very thin side to the point of being able to hear the elevator announcing floor stops from your room to people walking around upstairs also the maid service was great at cleaning but would remove items you re using an not replace them ie soap and towels 
 the service in the bar was not friendly or welcoming 
 room was too small the wifi is too poor they have give me an upgrade to a smaller room this hotel is 3 4 star at max
 lobby
 i booked a room with a king bed but the bed was actually a queen european discrepancy i guess the bar was never open in the evenings all during our stay 
 maybe more selection for breakfast hot food wise
 loby to small
 for those who goes to rai on business it is a good location however nothing there for a tourist far form city center 7 minutes walk to tram 30 minutes ride no restaurants or anything to do around 
 the doonas were very heavy in our room and woke us up the room heating is so good that lighter ones would be much better
 lack of towels
 while we checked in the hotel blocked the full amount and when we checked out they took the amount again said that this is pre autorisation and money will be unblocked soon but my bank said that hotel had blocked money for 30 days and they cant change it 
 i can t honestly think of anything that i disliked
 no shower cap in bathroom room needed a refresh carpet had seen better days 
 the air con in room was too noisy to use so room was red hot thus us having to have windows open all the stay bed was soo small for a double
 bad noise insulation hardly slept all night
 room was situated at the front along the road so a little noisy at times with the passing trams shower was leaky 
 no
 better wifi connection
 the room was really small a very dated doesn t matchwith the price who they charge
 nothing
 nothing 
 small elevator a sign indicates that they have an historical stairway therefore not possible to modify to accommodate a bigger elevator 
 the free wi fi did not work properly in our room it often dropped off or couldn t find the network 
 the room was more like a mini office than a typical bedroom suite and the bathroom sink was outside the bathroom these gripes however are easily outweighed by the positives and we will definitely go back 
 breakfast is way too expensive
 fire alarm scared me at night but they apologize the rooms small but comfy small hotel 
 the breakfast was too expensive so we didn t buy it and we had no view
 poor free internet connection only pay for internet gives decent connection poor quality breakfast 
 double bed very small and uncomfortable
 we booked months ahead and specified the room they assured us that would be fine i have stayed here many times over a 20 year period in my case before but will never do so again when we arrived we were told that because our flight arrived late we were there by 5pm we missed out on the room that we requested and were put in an unsatisfactory room after paying top dollar i was travelling with a young child and we were put on the 5th floor with no lift on a heat wave night in a room that was because there is no air conditioning uninhabitable 
 room next door was slamming doors at midnight 
 it was dark m needed more brighter lights to see in dressing room 
 poor design of corridors lobby stairs at the entrance
 there was not a single thing i could suggest for them to improve on 
 noisy and over priced
 the toilet bowl was in a very narrow area for a big chap like me this was an issue 
 hotel recently taken over by mega chain holiday inn and it shows rooms small and tired showers some of the worst i ve had in a hotel no water pressure changed rooms due to a door lock issue next room had all the same issues i m by no means a travel diva but you can find far better elsewhere in london 
 price of room too high for the room type room was basic tv remote did not work windows did not open very far meaning very little ventilation no smoking rooms at all
 hotel inside complicated with steps across and elevators spread over 4 buildings dark rooms the lighter ones are very noisy 
 coffee not hot enough poor lighting in dining room for elderly person
 the lack of signs on numerous occasions we ended up going down staff staircases and coming out not into public places 
 the furniture
 metro bus and tram journeys to city are an experience see plenty of the outskirts 
 bathroom looked tired could do with an upgrade 
 size of the room maybe due to limited space
 small room with single bed tho
 restaurant could be improved
 rooms a little small our room had a view of foyer rather than the city outside
 front desk staff weren t very responsive happy and lacked knowledge of the local area didn t take the initiative to call us when the taxi arrived so we nearly missed our friend s wedding ceremony there must have been a bubble in the water pipes as there was a vibration note that kept coming and going in the morning staff didn t seem to appreciate that this disturbed our sleep when we informed them i contacted in advance for early check in but they tried to play dumb when i arrived and also tried to charge me more than agreed by email clearly the room wasn t ready but they faffed about instead of being honest with me 
 few more hangers in the wardrobe would be useful 
 i did not like the fact that the room lacked a mini bar the hotel offers no spa or recreational area either it is more of a conference hotel than one for a leisure stay finally getting there without a car is not convenient at all there is a free shuttle service to and from the nearest metro stop but one first needs to arrive at the hotel to learn about it 
 nothing at all
 rooms not huge and no tea and coffee making facilities
 buffet breakfast seemed expensive 18 euros 
 as above really the rest was great
 while taking a shower the water spills all over the bathroom its a weird setup but nothing can be changed about that now 
 what i didn t like was arriving at the check in time to be told that our room would be 2 hours there was no reason for this my parent who had booked the room as a present had to ring the booking line and was told that it was not acceptable and the room should be ready after a little long wait we got in our room at 3 30 the receptionist who dealt with us was rude and we felt that as 19 year olds we were being taken advantage of especially as other people were checking in around us 
 stained carpet in room 
 lifts slow 
 small room and a bed
 bathroom was a bit cold very basic heating in the room plugin oil filled radiator 
 check in questionnaire was like a test sheet i am a smoker and know that there is no smoking in hotels however i was told i had to smoke outside in the morning i realized that there was a lovely courtyard where you could sit have coffee or cocktails and smoke although smoking is an unpopular and hot topic simply telling me that the courtyard was available would have been much preferred but we had a wonderful time and i would highly recommend the hotel 
 the music pounding out until 3am from a venue close by
 bar closed for private cocktail making on a saturday is utterly ridiculous no mention of this on booking or check in hotel took money from my account without permission well below 5 star service
 staff attitude
 the room wasn t cleaned properly not hoovered under children bed there was a 2 feet in diameter dark grey mouldy stain on the ceiling in the bathroom also the carpets were all stained during the breakfast they kept running out of cups eggs cakes juice and it took then ages to replenish those the key card didnt work had to go up and down two times then asked for different room 
 breakfast wasn t worth the money
 being an older building there wasn t good soundproofing you can hear the comings goings of people into the small hours footsteps doors talking etc 
 the room is old and dirty especially the bathroom there were many white spots on the glass we booked for 5 nights and left 2 days advance cannot stay in the room 
 we loved everything 
 didn t like the unfriendliness of the staff who checked us in 
 wifi not working
 the room was very small and hotel had only one lift the connection of wi fi was very bad
 there were several rooms of disruptive guests school children on my floor each day sometimes multiple times i had to call the front desk to report door slamming running back and forth in the hall loud noise this happened on sat night until 11 45 pm and began sunday morning at 7 30 am the hotel staff person on sunday night said i have asked the children to be quiet but they haven t done it so there is nothing we can do i could not believe this finally i asked her to meet me on my floor in the hallway and we were going to have a conversation with the children and their teacher adult accompanying them and get this resolved so we did just that the teacher was very attentive and he did stop the noise i just wonder why the hotel staff did not take such initiative on friday saturday and sunday so frustrating and disruptive i mentioned that i was certain there was a hotel policy on unnecessary noise and disruption but she didn t respond only saying that they had asked them to be quiet and they hadn t done it so they could do nothing this saturday night staff person said she would have the manager contact me i have received no word from the manager i also told this staff person that i would have to go on social media and state what happened as i wouldn t want this to happen to anyone else and she said go ahead i don t care i think this might be the bottom line she didn t care nor did the hotel 
 nothing
 room was too small and the bed was supposed to be a double however i have seen larger single beds hotel insisted that i pay for internet connection despite being an elite gold member availability of gold member benefits were not offered to me 
 couldn t fault hotel at all
 old property small rooms cannot control heat setting in room gets extremely warm at night had to leave window open
 room was just big enough to move around absolutely no space to lay your luggage open no kettle provided upon request it was brought up but again gotta requesf for a cup no cofee tea in the room either hairdryer was difficult to use gotta press hard onto the button to operate it and irs very heavy 
 the room was very small not really suitable for 2 people the heating didn t work so they eventually gave us a heater the heating didn t come on to 6 at night which wouldn t be very satisfactory if weather was very cold
 the downstairs breakfast area is not as nice as the upstairs
 our friends who i booked in at the same time as us hated their room it was noisy and cramped this is all because the previous guest failed to move out of their room we had to sort this problem out after returning from our night out 
 the staff had a terribly unhelpful attitude my room wasn t ready for me for the agreed time so had to move rooms again later in the evening the bathroom was not cleaned to the standard you d expect it to be 
 lack of customer service no communication from staff rude staff no interest in resolving problems thoroughly unimpressed with a supposed 5 star hotel
 air con very noisy
 car park price
 the restaurant was badly soundproofed it felt a bit noisy because of that it is a quite expensive hotel 
 would have loved more coffee for the room and perhaps better quality shower gel and shampoo a bar would have been nice or a mini bar in room but there are places nearby 
 some rooms looked a little run down 
 breakfast 
 the room at the front of hotel on street level was noisy overnight with many lanes of traffic zooming past even though double glazed windows were closed thankfully we can sleep anywhere but it may bother some people there was no hot water in the bathroom sink taps by 10pm but maybe this was a one off
 room was small 
 the blanket was too warm edges of the wallpaper in the room were torn 
 nothing 
 nothing really 
 the fact we were unable to use the swimming pool while we were there when we paid to stay in the hotel think you should be able to use swimming pool without paying extra if your staying there also staff were not helpful when we had an issue opening the door to our room too 
 temperature of room was too warm with no facility to reduce the same 
 check in and check out is slow reception staff is either not adequate or the system they are using is too slow may be separate concierge will also help speed up things
 the room is so small it is difficult to navigate around i was there for two nights and for the money there are better options in the vicinity 
 nothing
 lots of renovations taking place which was on show shower dirty and cracked took way too long to check in
 i would expect better equipped gym which is very poor
 the pillows too hard and lumpy also the sheets etc were rough to the touch 
 they should provide a safe in each room or provide the reception one for free as opposed to charging 5 50 euros a day plus a 50 euro deposit i would have hoped for bathrobes the pool wasn t maintained but i assumed it was probably there for aesthetic reasons as it s small 
 piped music in restaurant coffee at breakfast 
 we where not told in different buildings in cambridge street
 could be a bit cheaper 
 loved it just be aware that to reach the top floor you need to climb some stairs 
 one of the staff of the reception was not friendly and a bit aracist
 nothing yet
 the worst bed we have had to sleep on in our 9 weeks of travel through europe this despite the fact that we were in a superior room the sagging in the middle pointed its long term use 
 we only had breakfast but the food was a bit mass produced i e just average what was poor was the staff were not very helpful and you had to chase them down if you wanted tea or coffee 
 the wifi sometimes was slow to stream for example homeland news but othervise everithing was perfect 
 air condition was a bit hot
 how small the room was i upgraded for my first wedding anniversary and was extremely disappointed we have stopped a few times in standard rooms and upgrade was 400 a night more and not worth a penny of it
 food so so wifi in room didn t work complaints not handled promptly really not at all sent complimentary pastry and removed them before i could eat them expensive for what it offers 
 room is a bit small for the price 
 room had cob webs
 the curtains in the room didn t cover all the sunlight so i woke up very early with sunlight in my eyes i really tried to close them but the coverage is very poor the minibar fridge didn t work the temperature was the same as room temperature 
 staff not interested in sorting out my problem security staff extremely rude and aggressive 
 nothing bad it was just that the hotel was faded needed re decorating and the staff impersonal 
 upon arrival we were told the type of room we booked and per paid double was not available at the price we paid after finally agreeing to paying additional cost we got our room but had to pay an additional cost above the reservation cost we also had to pay additional for internet and breakfast the internet was the worst and the breakfast was not worth the additional cost we extended our stay because the location was near the train and this was excellent for getting around the city when we returned home i found two charges for the additional stay i spoke with the clerk twice to verify that the 198 one day was cancelled and re booked for an additional four days the problem is i am billed twice for the same room i have not been able to get my money back i would really appreciate the hotel making this correction by submitting the proper credit to my american express the hotel had at lease three fire drills during our stay one required us to walk down four flights of stairs to exit the building and the other happen late at night we were greeted by a staff person informing us that it was a false alarm 
 i cannot work out what the doormen are for they can be replaced by a small wooden wedge or an auto door one of them spends his time yelling at the staff 
 a better range of food in my room also the lift was small and just fitted one person in with a case 
 some of the decor looked a little tired 
 small room but as you d expect in london
 nothing 
 room service was overly expensive more than nice fine dining and when we tried to book airport shuttle times were not convenient 
 everything was just fine for our short stay 
 the bed linen were disgusting in the first place after day 1 i accidentally spilled orangejuice on my bed in the morning and when i came back in the afternoon they flipped my bed linen and acted like the whole bed was changed overall poor hygiene 
 just about everything else particularly the cost but also service food and a room inferior to a premier inn breakfast food was the poorest of canteen standard and a real bunfight we left ours and had breakfast out which added insult to injury not to mention the cost i have stayed here in the past but standards have really slipped sadly i cannot recommend 
 they take 3 days to fix wifi signal problem some staff have no experience
 building site next door dlr very noisy rooms dated wifi should be free
 needs new beds pillows
 the rooms don t havea refrigerator or at least water glasses no heat control 
 nothing
 stayed in a triple single room which turned out to be in the basement with one window looking into a light well wish we had known before booking 
 our room was lovely except not quiet we could hear every footstep from the room above us and beside us it was our only negative and perhaps just down to where our room was situated other than that we enjoyed our stay very much 
 no complaints not my favourite neighbourhood in milan but convenient maybe a gym would be nice or did i miss that 
 very small room for 3 
 stay wasnt long enough 
 perhaps room over priced as were breakfast menu
 location
 breakfast doesn t have any kind of cheese and it was amazing no tea or coffee maker in the room 
 window didn t open a c inflexible staff had little local knowledge hotel runs a taxi scam with minimum charge for any minicab ordered and totally unwilling to use black cabs black cab cost half fare quoted by hotel 
 a bit pricy and bathroom toiletries 
 nothing 
 cleanliness poor hair on the floor from previous guest plus hair from the equipment you use to clean i am a guy and the hair on the floor was a woman s comfort the bed is too hard even if you have tried to solve this with a mattress topper also for the amount of money you pay you don t expect to come back to the room every night to find your pyjamas thrown on the armchair if you don t want to fold it up then at least leave it on the bed because the chair fabric is full of germs value for money well it s london so that s that
 little bit far from center 20 min but we know it 
 shower head didn t spray water very far into bath hard to control temp of water
 chairs in the bar were very uncomfortable 
 broken power sockets rooms in need of refurbishment workmen outside of first floor window at 6 30 am overcharged at checkout no room in parking lot 
 a bit expencive
 bed was huge room was small 
 a bit old unstable wifi not that close to the museumplein 
 i was staying in a twin room with an old school friend the bathrooms have a glass door and window allowing anyone else in the room to see you in the bathroom and shower not the toilet that s private and seperate it didn t bother me but could see it being embarrassing in other situations 
 but there is a bad smell one side of the bed 
 choice of breakfast items space inside the room temperature control availability of brushes razors which i forgot to bring along with me
 no canal view from our room
 terrible wifi connectivity makes me think twice about booking in future inconvenient when on business
 nothing
 the room was quite small and nothing special for 355 a night 
 no kettle in the room no air conditioning in the room and the temperature was hot during the night 
 the space but can t expect much in city center
 basically everything is fair
 i stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room the attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting 
 the hotel was rather shabby a lot of scuffed scratched walls and paint work floors not cleaned properly no quiet place to sit bar area full of hustle and bustle from staff we had to request a remote for the t v then we had to have someone reconnect the t v and for the rest of our stay you had to move close to the t v to change channels breakfast on the first day not bad on second very poor barely cooked tomato mushroom over cooked with leathery skin order was wrong waiter had to return with missing food still waiting for our toast even though we requested it twice had to ask for plates to be removed not a relaxing experience over priced hotel for what we received the reality did not match our expectations 
 a little more selection in the restaurant at affordable prices would be an advantage this would compete with the many restaurants in the area 
 the service was not so perfect at breakfast the server was extremely rude and had an awful attitude it was unacceptable furthermore the rooms heating did not work and the employees could only fix it after a day 
 the wi fi did drop a few times and did seem to be better later at night but that was my only quibble 
 appeared a tad tired and dated
 no hash browns for breakfast 
 room was cold with very loud air conditioning but there were no controls in the room to turn it off room did not have a window which we knew at booking but we did not realise that this would mean that the room would be really hidden away from the other rooms almost as if you were in the staff quarters no one directed us to our room and as the rooms numbers did not follow in numerical order it took us over 15 minutes to locate our room we were actually over the other end of the building to the other room numbers that were in the 100 s rather than with them mould on the shower curtain was also not a very nice surprise 
 ground floor room on street next to entrance to annex across the road was very noisy mattress was totally shot with a crater in it very uncomfortable and impossible to sleep on room rather small for double and decor tired and scruffy 
 the breakfast was ok but my expectations was not met
 beds were very uncomfortable and cheap looking very thin soft mattress that kept sliding off the base i woke up with back pain every morning the food in floor 17 was poor very poor selection and overpriced i only saw people order the burger the maids woke us up most mornings at 9am even when we had a sign on the door one morning they woke us up just to tell us we had walked in some dust from the park outside this place is not worth the money we paid i wouldn t stay here again 
 the gym was not very good and the choice of late night food was very limited 
 gym seems to be a little old 
 every hotel should provide drinking water in rooms there was a shop downstairs but not always open really think drinking water should be a basic provision in a hotel of this standard 
 tv not working and smell from bathroom drainage 
 was expecting better facility rooms and overall atmosphere 
 i specifically requested a non main street facing room yet was allocated room 155 which is so noisy it is akin to sleeping outside in the street i had two nights very bad and constantly broken sleep in my opinion this hotel should not even charge for this room as it is unfit for purpose as i doubt anybody could get a good nights sleep given how noisy this room is 
 not much life in the hotel small boutique hotel 
 i had requested an early check in only an hour before normal check in time we were left for nearly 2 hours in the lobby just off reception and kind of forgotten about we were asked if we wanted to be transferred to a sister hotel in holborn i said i didnt due to all the amazing things i had planned in the area so the lady said she would be back in 5 mins 40 mins later a coach load of people were checking in and our day was cut shorter because i had to go looking for the lady who was dealing with us eventually we were able to check in the continental breakfast was pretty standard but you should be allowed a pot of tea in the morning not just one cup 
 location to far from paris centre very noisy and staff not very friendly when asked about them putting bill on twice he said don t speak english 
 was woken twice during the stay with false fire alarms 
 the rooms are small and the breakfast is too expensive there are no commodities gym pool bar etc 
 nothing to dislike 
 i had asked for a disabled access room when making my booking through booking com when we arrived there was none available and the message didn t seem to have been passed on however we managed in the room we were given 
 construction underway in street right in front should have been offered a discount for inconvenience cab could not drop us and our luggage at door noise 
 the recepcionist a blonde girl wouln t even answer back when we said good morning rude manners never seen before in a hotel totally unacceptable 
 view from the room could have been better
 housekeeping was making too much noise early in the morning all the days we were there 
 room service cleaning lady was very unpleasant and unprofessional the rooms were quite worn down
 the reception gave us too many wrong information especially the addresses 
 air conditioning inadequate but staff did provide fan on request
 i was not happy at all with size of my room and it was an expansive amount for such a small room that i can t walk comfortably in 
 their was nothing not to like
 slow elevator if that can be considered a negative 
 pillow was a bit hard air conditioning deteriorated as the week went on and the outside temperature rose 
 small rooms small bathrooms and disturbance
 late check out not available 
 there was no information about free parking space we needed to pay for a parking even that we saw that no all the parking spots was taken
 offered room upgrade to have a window for 20 when declined i found my room had a window anyway so could have been ripped off cleaners barged into room while getting ready to have a shower slightly embarrassing and even came back a second time room service called 3 times to ask about an order that had been cancelled unnecessary hassle very late at night 
 not enough toiletries for two people 
 room was tiny and double bed was merely two small single beds pushed together bathroom looked like a fishbowl glass walls which gave little to no privacy the gym consisted of three machines in an over sized closet 
 noise from the street needed ear plugs had to ask for our room to be cleaned 
 room was quite small but definitely manageable 
 lack of milk and tea within the rooms
 some one had to have a room at the back of the hotel but not a problem
 the rooms didn t had tea and coffee making facilities and was first time in my life that i acctually needed one breakfast has a la carte eggs few options and expensive 
 breakfast quality was ok not brilliant bad food quality for the room service 
 a little repair work needed here and there but overall it didn t ruin a wonderful experience 
 my single room felt rather cramped but that was mainly due to the size of wardrobe and other furniture 
 room space
 small room for breakfast not so many options for hot meals
 room was quite basic in comparison to the overall hotel no coffee making facilities in the room 
 the electronic keys do not function well the lower priced rooms have unpleasant high windows the better more expensive rooms are very fine 
 none
 not enough nespresso capsules
 loved it all 
 shower lights were broken outlets were confusing to figure out and location was further than it seemed online
 we were told we could get coffee and soft drinks 24 hrs but the exec club was only open at meal times check in was laborious i was paying for 2 rooms and that seemed a bit difficult
 shower it just flooded the whole bathroom we used it before we went to bed but it was still flooded hours later when going to the toilet so had to dry feet before returning to bed 
 king bed was twin bed connected 
 the classic room was to small for more than one person 
 promised a city view with no city view and a spa with treatments which wasn t the case the double bed was very large but was actually two pushed together which was very uncomfortable 
 the single rooms are very small the complimentary mini bar was only stocked once i have never seen such a small bottle of heineken rhe tvs are a little dated 
 kettle didn t work i had to ask 3 times before it was replaced also i requested a quiet room and there was a very loud woman shouting into her phone at regular intervals i could hear everything 
 the tolites in room were were way too small the doors of the tolites should open outwards or sliding instead of opening inwards which make it even more cramp and inconvenient 
 key cards didn t work on the door most days had 2 cards only 1 worked but had to have it reprogrammed almost daily and door handle was broken 
 too much house perfume in the lobby and the corridors toxic
 size of room was very small d cor in the room was very tired with a musty smell in the room tv was very poor quality and signal poor bathroom was very cramp and not very welcoming unlikely i would stay here again 
 dripping tap no water in room no main light switch had to turn each lamp of seperate not informed of the rates of the car park plus the additional rate it had gone up could of been at the holiday in 5 min down the road 
 we had heavy luggage and the walking distance was further than had anticipated easy route by taxi or bus 
 nothing 
 nothing 
 some live music dj at hotel for once we d come back from our night out as there wasn t any on on the nights we stayed mon tues 
 grossly overpriced no bath lighting in room appaling when staying as a couple breakfast very poor only one toaster which was faulty room was noisy with poor soundproofing from road outside extremely disappointed in this hotel 
 our room was at first floor while i had told them i want it to be at upstairs when i reserved the hotel it was noisy as we can not sleep sometimes 
 we had booked 3 rooms one room was changed twice as ac bathroom water flow in bathroom was not working which caused extreme inconvenience the hotel staff told us they will compensate but till today we did not hear from them at the checkout we were told the hotel management will write to us but they did not
 room was a little small and not much room for clothes if we had been staying longer but ideal for a weekend
 no bath robes and having to get several trains into london
 some staff were not very friendly and impatient but it could just be the big city attitude 
 the air conditioning lack of tea and coffee making facility in the room 
 price of a gin and tonic in the bar 
 over priced room service but poor food no pool hotel not up to 5 star standard needs modernising
 person who greeted us at reception late at night was a little grumpy doesn t help when you are tired after travelling a long way and a little worried about having found the right hotel however other staff were wonderful 
 when arriving we realized why this was so cheap my room was to the inner square a 5m by 5m slightly dirty area and i was ground floor thus very little light absolutely no view otherwise rooms are okay but we assume there are some nicer ones with windows the ones to the busy road might though be noisy 
 the price of the sky lounge bar i understand the standard of the hotel but for a malibu flavoured liqueur with coke and a corona it s understandable as to why my jaw dropped when i got told it would be 18 00 for the 2 drinks 
 nothing
 we opted for the with breakfast stay when breakfast was delivered to our room we could only order once however i think it should be made to order as many times within the morning 
 lovely bedroom but no space to walk round my bed 
 attitude of certain front line staff
 we were traveling back home from scotland and booked this hotel because have to be around the victoria when we arrived at 20 00 the hotel staff proposed to move to another hotel without any adequate explication the new one was ok but our last night in london was failed 
 nothing bad
 i was unavoidably delayed for one day sent message and email still charged the full price as if i did not show up at all is that correct 
 construction outside my window but not deal breaker just bad timing 
 training needed for some staffs 
 long wait for the lift in the morning the odd procedure of needing a voucher for breakfast the exceptionally greasy crisps in the bar the price fluctuates a lot and can at times be too high for what the hotel offers
 should i really say something here okok small nightstands 
 as i wanted to pay our total payment on arrival the staff said ok and gave us the invoice which was only 338 eur as i asked back it is a lot less than expected he said that is the total we even got an invoice for our total lenght of stay with 338 eur however when we were checking out they said it was a mistake and we should be paying the whole amount which is 938 eur well it was not a big problem just annoying that somebody made a mistake they recognized it and then only let us know at the very end because in the meantime we were happily enjoying the black friday since we thought have some plus 
 airco a bit cold during he night noises in the street during the night but this is of course the price to pay to be in the very center of the city 
 facilities may need to be upgraded 
 there re no open window due to safety which is ok but even the air condition were not working and the room are like a squeeze toilet basement absolutely i will advise no one to stay in this hotel
 non friendly staff
 rooms are small 14m2 for a medium sized priced room
 noisy at night in rooms on front of hotel
 cooked breakfast is not included in the price no fridge minibar in the room 
 room looking tired decor wise some sharp artex and sloppy paintwork
 nothing
 breakfast in the hotel costs like a dinner on la rambla no electric sockets next to the bed quite loud on the corridor walls doors don t really isolate it old furniture
 the sheets could have been changed
 breakfast was continental not full english quality was good but maybe a tad monotonous for a longer stay 
 it is across the street from museumsquartier so it can get noisy during the night with all the people heading home also the tram is under the window
 internet was slow value for money 
 carpets and tepich are very old and dirty
 both pools close at 8pm which was really disappointing
 the location was good but it would have been ideal if there had been more reasonably priced parking at the hotel we parked in westfield which was much cheaper 
 room was in the basement a small dungeon like room with no natural light 
 price and quality
 have given it a 10 despite coming out of the lift to find stairs up to our rooms which we didn t know about we had someone with walking difficulties and 10 steps with heavy suitcases was disappointing check carefully where your room is 
 room was too cold 
 that they don t have staff 2 carry out bags and sometimes they just entre the room without even asking even if i kept do not distrib i see they come in the room 2 clean it
 rooms could be a little more quiet there is great insolation from outside but you could hear through the walls i had to hail my own taxi 4 30 in the morning not good 
 we d appreciate if a kettle was available 
 nothing not to like 
 rooms where small and cluttered bathroom was tiny
 facilities look old and no free water in the room there is no luggage store room so we have to leave our luggages in the public area inside the reception room
 food and drink at the hotel very expensive 7 euro for a beer 6 or for a 200ml bottle of coke or 330ml water burger and chips 21 euros was lovely but way over priced on check out was charged for stay after already paying bookings com in advance i was again charge by hotel checking out bill should of been 150 but ended up being nearly 600 this meant i couldn t afford food or water for me and my son at in airport on route home and couldnt get home once landed back in liverpool as i didnt have any money left hotel wasnt interested in this just wanted the money as i didnt have a bank statement with me to prove i had paid this was supposed to be a holiday in a life time for me and my son to a 5 star hotel for his birthday and i have ended up with no money and now the task of having to try and get a refund thanks 
 no drinks facilities in the room noisy at night particularly friday night 
 the room is too tight no lifts
 it s a hotel for big group tourists check in was quite nightmare because it s almost always busy not enough porters to help with luggage they are not really helpful although they re not rude at all but really lack of genuine good service 
 the reception staff were rude our key cards did not seem to be working so we asked for help we were given another set and a patronising teach in on how to use them when these did not seem to work we asked the concierge who finally informed us that we should have been told that the door handle had to be pulled up not down due to safety reasons the reception staff had forgotten to tell us this 
 traffic but not the fault of hotel double glazing good 
 the staff at the reception were rude they never changed my room to a double room they were lazy and always gave excuses 
 no ventilation in room to hot only worked on heating 
 our room and the next room there were door between connecting room noise there were noise people this is not good in this category same doors is not simular than normal wall 
 i have booked this hotel based on my previous stay which was great and room was very nice and it was renovated i had no idea that there are old rooms which are so tinny and not comfortable at the same price i have complained at the reception they told they will move us but at the end did nothing not very proactive team also internet was not working during my stay at all disappointing stay 
 my ac didn t work in summer 
 the hotel or booking com does not state that giving your card details for the authorisation of the booking means giving the hotel half of the total fee even though you are paying in cash at the hotel it s bs 
 breakfast was very basic and cold in general i would rather pay less and have breakfast in the city
 the japanese restaurant had little selection and every item ordered was wrong 
 smallish rooms limited breakfast buffet
 there were many points that we didn t like as follows 1 the hotel has confirmed that they could arrange not a duplex room to us prior to our arrival but unfortunately we got a duplex room 2 regarding the duplex room there was no mirror and wardrobe on the upper floor whereas the shower was located on the upper deck i e after taking a shower we have to get change downstairs 3 there was no electric socket for the use of hairdryer in the shower room 4 the air conditioner vent was facing the pillows and we have to switch off the air conditioner when we went to bed 5 on our 2nd stay morning there was some muddy water flushing out from the shower head this was ridiculous and at the end we were late for our meeting 6 there was limited choice of the breakfast and the services was bad we ve ordered the salmon bagel and end up getting some bacon besides my husband ordered a boiled egg for each of us and at the end 2 boiled eggs was served for each of us the scramble egg was dry and tasteless 7 my husband felt sick and we asked the reception to call for the sos doctor and replied to us the expected arrival time of the doctor after 15 mins no reply and we have to call back the reception to follow up with them 8 after arriving i was unpacking and my husband was taking a shower on the upper deck of the room we heard someone came in and out of our room freely for a few times downstairs we were flustered locked the door and put the do not disturb sign out immediately all in all i was very surprised that this was claimed to be a 5 stars hotel and extremely disappointed of this hotel there were a lot of rooms for improvement and this is so far the worse hotel that i had ever stayed 
 my last night i call for a towels several times for five hours still they promise to send it but i have not received any towels 
 breakfast cpuld be better and better value for money 
 i had to think hard to find something i didn t like but if i had to find a fault for others although it s not something that i would be bothered about is that the lift is small a snug three people lift which was more than adequate for me and the slightly patchy wifi 
 doesn t look the same as the picture showed on the website so i was expected a bigger room but in fact the room size was quiet small 
 dull room vey basic for the price
 the kitchen was not that well equipped with utensils would ask for a quiet room away from the main entrance facing the court yard 
 what i didn t like is that we only had two nights to stay there 
 bake beans with the full english cooked in some kind of chilli tomato
 the name is quite misleading as it s a good 10 minute walk from kx more if you ve heavy luggage and it s not really in bloomsbury smokers and cigarette butts outside the main door 
 the staffs are not co operative no politeness and helping nature even after paying 350 euro per night no good hospitality 
 far too small awful breakfast 
 i loved frames restaurant in the hotel the staff there were very friendly on the contrary the reception staff were not as friendly the location is good u have a very good distance from eiffel tower but with a slight corner not a full view and the hotel has a sports ground for football which can be a bit noisy in mornings if ir looking to relax all in all its a good hotel nice interior rooms are in good size compared to hotels in europe
 chips should have been cooked for a little longer 
 did not have the family room we asked for and tryed to give us 2 rooms instead but eventually found us a twin room not the hotels fault but a lot of kids chasing each other about the corridors after 11pm
 far from town
 toilets system
 bed was very hard room 204
 room service food
 wifi horrible
 food prices a little pricy so we ate out every meal tried to charge us an extra 80 upon checking out which they then said was charged in error after much questioning which put a dampener on the trip 
 air con was not working however hotel did best to fix quickly they brought fan up and large plate of summer fruits and a drink
 didn t realise it was alcohol free room quite expensive
 the rooms are a little tired more like a travelodge feel from 1997 
 room cramped and awkward nice bathroom though 
 not having to queue for breakfast 
 very expensive if you use the room only to sleep
 two of the staff were having a disagreement at reception which was a big uncomfortable 
 not keen on having a below ground bedroom with no view
 hotel was a little off the beaten track so took a little while to get our bearings as rather than take taxi or public transport we like to walk a lot hotel roof top bar was very nice but views of the city not the best guys who work in the roof top bar were very professional and i know they work long hours but a smile wouldn t go a miss every now and again if your travelling for business its a very good hotel sightseeing not so much and i don t think that i would stay here again even though i can t really fault the facilities just tucked away from the action a little too much for us 
 can hear feel the underground metro passing under the building toilet orientation washing sink is outside separate 
 reception was a little awkward to find we expected to walk in a door to reception straight behind the big aloft sign that was the only negative
 the air con in the room did mot work and it was very cold in the room as a result we were unable to turn up the thermostate and as a result room remained very cold
 bathroom not so clean
 issue with the shower drainage the water drains very slow 
 i could here running water all night and it took me ages to find where it was coming from i did not complain as i did not want the bother of changing rooms however after 3 restless nights i wish i had 
 the room was small
 would have been helpful for us if the hotel had offered something in the way of food throughout the day especially having 2 young children but they didn t mind us bringing some snacks in and eating them in the courtyard 
 really don t like the red color scheme feels like an old hotel in vegas didn t feel like a north american best western to me missed that feeling felt like it was too expensive for location and a very standard room it was very quiet though 
 the view from the window was very bad and some machine behind the window on the roof was very noisy i m gluten free so breakfast was not so god 
 no ac
 wifi connection not very stable
 found the charging system a little confusing ie prepayment of one night s accommodation plus 60 not sure why this was necessary
 bad smell in the bathroom 
 if i wouldn t upgrade then wifi wouldn t be strong enough the basic treatment and not more 
 the room in the basement 
 we have nothing to complain about 
 difficult to order breakfast because the waiter doesn t speak english 
 room is ok but interior is very basic a little reminiscent of student accommodation corridors and general fringes of room staring to look a little worn tired ridiculously early check out and breakfast only til 9 30 
 nothing whatsoever 
 nothing
 the rooftop bar full of stuck up snotty arrogant shallow people
 room was extremely small
 check out is at 12 noon and at 11 53 am i got a knock on the door asking when i will leave admiditally i was about 5 min late out of the room in the end but i think it was a little bit extreme 
 there is no basic creams lotions and other accessories
 maybe the sink but i get use to it 
 staff were very professional lacked a bit of personality and friendliness
 superior room located at the first floor is very loud and next to the garbage bins 4 of them infront of the window creating no comfort at all i had to keep continuously the curtains pulled and no daylight in the room is not pleasant at all pitty as the staff is nice and helpful and the hotel seems to be generally alright 
 price of food and drinks
 honestly nothing to complain about this is my second time staying at this hotel and would recommend it again 
 bit on the expensive side for just one but i m worth it 
 paid wi fi a hotel of this category ought to offer free unlimited wi fi outside windows still need cleaning
 nothing
 the bedroom was a double i had been upgraded from a single by the hotel one side of the double bed was against the wall under the window frankly if there had been two of us in there it would have been very uncomfortable there was one chair in the room with nowhere to relax except on the bed breakfast was very ordinary
 no cable for the sound system to listen with my phone
 not a single thing 
 nothing
 at the end of diagonal road away from la ramba
 the room was very small for two of us 
 the bedroom and bathroom were a bit small
 bar staff charged different prices for the same drinks and were not very friendly
 the lifts could do with some attention
 smears on mirrors and one bath towel in a room for two guests 
 it was a bad bad experience this was my and my husbands first trip together when i booked it was an option about choosing 2 single beds or 1 double bed i chose doublebed of course at the areival in the room it was 2 singlebeds in the room which they had made into a doublebed when we asked about this in the reception they denied to do anything avout it maybe the reason also was that i had prepaid i slept on this doublebed for 2 days and it was bad and terrible sleeping the staff had this rude and arrogant behaviour about this bed and simply denied to help us at all so dont trust this hotel 
 some day didn t give the water at first it s so difficult to find the hotel because of hidden hotel 
 wayyyyy overpriced i got a booking com discount but i would have been really upset if i paid the normal price this is nowhere near a 4 gym is only opened 7 00 11 00pm which is useless if you get up early and have to work no restaurant in the hotel either overall very disappointing 
 nothing i don t like
 cold swimming pool and the attendant disappeared without giving us a key to lockers ball of hair from a filter left on side of pool no bathrobes in room cleaning crew all male swearing loudly outside door f king this and f king that concierge desk couldn t get a taxi as system wasn t working pouring with rain and told to walk up road to get one ourselves dressed for evening most other hotels had people getting cabs outside for guests left umbrella on concierge desk and someone took it
 second night a noise kept going off like a bell until 2am then it stopped then started again at just after 6 am was not happy about that
 the room is very dirty and i got bed bugs bite after stay 
 breakfast drinks too expensive room was small even for london standards 
 nothing
 no doors between the main bathroom and the rest of the room equals no privacy room service hot breakfast items were cold when coffee is poured into a cup in the kitchen and transferred to the room it will end up cold simple try insulated jugs weekend party time in the bar restaurant next to the reception area is unbearably noisy i could not eat or drink there at those times 
 the bed was too small even the pillows were too big for it 
 i requested a room overlooking the river we got a room with a white washed very small window i had said it was my husbands 50th birthday surprise weekend when i booked yet i had to go and complain about it not the best start to our weekend we were moved to a a room with a view after i complained but having to do so we only just made out theatre time all became very rushed and harrised 
 the reception staff attitude was really bad check in was really bad they were unfriendly and with attitude 
 i didn t like that the entrance to the bathroom was next to the bed through a glass door and that the wardrobe was also in the bathroom
 body lotion would have been good travellers with hand luggage have liquids constraints 
 leaving 
 i ve ordered boiled eggs for breakfast couldn t finish them and asked to send them to my room to eat later which was done but then the cleaning stuff cleared the eggs away so i didn t have a chance to eat them it was fun 
 nothing
 v noisy lots of things in the room need fixing eg loose wobbly shelf and broken plug in bathroom 
 the room was a little loud im not sure if a c unit was near our room but it was grinding and kept me awake 
 the elevator was a bit small toilet was small too
 electric radiator in room felt cheap and possibly dangerous 
 room not cleaned in three days we were there breakfast very poorly managed everything kept running out cups plates water in coffee machine milk tea bags
 nothing
 i booked a single room but there is a bunk bed i don t like that kind of bed the hotel is clean but some guests smoke in front of the main door 
 the beds are ridiculously small it s just about fits a 6 1 male let alone a couple in future will be upgrading but the price not worth that so unless it s s deal won t be going because i need a bigger bed n to get that you must upgrade your room
 room so small we could barely fit with our suitcases 
 i didn t like that the toilet brush in the room was dirty and probably wasn t cleaned ever a bit too expensive
 quite far off from euston
 room is so small not comfortable for that price and then the location is not that good
 it was a pity that the hotel restaurant was closed for the month of august also the bar arrangements could be improved but this does not distract from the overall impression of the hotel 
 when they cleaned the room they threw to the waste the sim of my mobile phone i had left on the desk besides my computer
 the bed was uncomfortable a little hard
 all was good
 wifi was not working when we arrived but that was fixed by the evening
 attention stealing the room money all pack of cigarettes cosmetics stinks of sewage mold in the room 
 nothing really
 the comfort of the bed was terrible 
 with cold temperatures outside the blanket was a bit too thin the reception and bar had no bottle opener room very small
 no negatives 
 the bar and food were a little to expensive for my liking but thats to be expected in london 
 one of the worst internet qualities i have experienced in recent years uncomfortable bed and blanket tiny bathroom food is poor service is not a 5 service and overall this is 3 4 star hotel and definitely not 5 it misses most of the components of must have in 5 ranking 
 shame one of the restaurants was shut but with two more on site it wasn t a deal breaker 
 we didn t feel like we had good directions to the hotel 
 the lighting in the room could have been better as it was rather dark no air conditioner
 curtain track wasn t up to the job needed a cord pulley my electrician husband thought the electrics were done more for the electricians convenience than the customers very slow lift 
 all over
 breakfast awful
 smelly wardrobes spiderwebs on the windows room s terrace dirty but really dirty hotel in desperate need of investment to upgrade it 
 i really do not think it should have been that expensive 
 small bath
 although this is not hotel s fault if you stay in a room next to the road there is a lot of traffic and other noise just to give the heads up for those who appreciate silence request a room at the back of the hotel slight maintenance can be done in room bathroom 
 nothing
 nothing 
 all fine
 the ceiling fell through in the middle of the night 3am due to a faulty air conditioning unit reception did not answer my call and was uable to change room or report the incident until i checked out there imediate offer was to offer a reduction in the cost of my room but i have refused to pay for hotel room this is reasonable and they were lucky that the ceiling fell on the floor and not me the emails from the hotel have further aggrevated the compaint as they have said i am holding them to ransom as i have refused to pay for the nights accomodation this i beleive is not unreasonable and i should not have been expected to pay anything opinions would be welcome 
 nothing
 shuttle service to london city airport and nearest train stop would hv been great 
 small rooms need updating with modern interior
 room was very small standard double shower floor drain was not working soundproofing was poor between the rooms 
 breakfast choice was limited and i have a deep seated hatred of nespresso pods 
 i made a genuine mistake when booking this hotel and accidentally booked it for a day earlier than required arrived in paris phoned the hotel who were extremely unhelpful and despite having available rooms for the night i needed and having taken the not so cheap room rate for the no show the night before they would not allow me to stay without repaying apparently there is no such thing as customer goodwill anymore it might be a nice enough hotel but it s not cheap and in my experience the staff were rude and unhelpful shame because i was really looking forward to staying there 
 nothing
 the size of the room
 lack of prepared fruit at breakfast only a small thing i know 
 no room safe surprisingly no bottle of water in the room
 no refrigerator sauna very dark to get there i can t go alone tt
 no provision of toiletries cost for 2 day stay in comparison was a bit too high 
 the bathroom was quite small and did not have a bath breakfast was only basic with not much of a choice
 bed too soft could have harder the t v in the bedroom was faulty throughout my stay
 nothing
 only one british plug socket in the room apart from those that connected the mini bar and tv two european sockets available which if i d known i could have taken an adapter 
 the food was not very diversified
 i upgraded the room and i paid 100 then when i was checking out they asked me to pay it again because i don t have a receipt is that even fair
 not so central so didn t provide any special view also bit expensive 
 no disable parking available in fact one space was filled with a car covered with a car cover so not moving below carpark had no lighting at night and little room to manoeuvre the room was not at all as described in the photo and lot smaller than expected especially for the price paid will be contacting thistle also lifts too small to fit wheelchair in 
 air conditioning was a little noisy
 there is road construction next to the hotel which is noisy from early morning
 the 2 elevators and i had to leave 
 breakfast expensive and description misleading 39 for 2 english breakfasts unacceptable addition of mandatory service charge an insult based on the total lack of service how can a service charge be justified for a self service breakfast day 2 went to costa better breakfast and i was treated as a customet rather than a commodity
 plug in bath shower was not user friendly and without any instructions it was obvious that previous guests had also struggled with it a hook on the back of the bathroom door would have been a useful addition 
 can t think of anything not even any trivial issues with this hotel 
 my only crticism is that the breakfast wasn t great there was plenty of food but perhaps it was too continental for my taste 
 nothing everything was really great 
 size of rooms quality of food at breakfeast
 no hot water for shower water was only luke warm not even warm poor drainage in shower 
 we didn t stay long enough 
 bad street name and indication leaving from the metro station
 more vegetables at breakfast
 the sheets look used
 some of the rooms are not up to the quality of others however we asked for a different room and were treated to a fenomenal one 
 the bed was not very comfortable and the sugar for the tea was so old it was solid 
 wifi should be free of cost and 24 hours nonstop to all rooms rather than just 20mins free service per room per day
 nothing
 there were refurbishment works going on in the atrium and on the roof swimming pool neither caused any problem to us and work has to be done at some time 
 staff didn t seem to show any real interest in solving issues or had much knowledge on process
 not too close from public transport 
 it was very quiet and comfortable right near the hop on hop off bus stop but a little removed from the city centre 
 no breakfast included in the price and the prices of the food at the hotel facilities were very expensive
 room small and claustrophobic and in the basement 
 breakfast on the second visit was not as fresh it appeared we had just missed the rush and there was not much of a fresh choice for the english breakfast 
 nothing
 ex suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before the temperature of the room could not be lower than 18 degrees which wasn t cool enough 
 bathtub size small not much space for clothes
 i requested a bath for my room which i got however when we came to use it the plug was broken so had to shower instead minor issue but was looking forward to relaxing 
 nothing
 hallway smell small bathroom which was uncleaned properly when we arrived 
 the lobby and our room were very smokey people smoked below our window the staff did move us which improved it our room was very small breakfast was ok but nor great
 perhaps typical for paris but slightly high prices the location introduces difficulties insane prices for parking if came by car 
 toilet in half open bathroom
 breakfast terrible failed to clean room one day
 value for money bed cupbaord wardrobe
 breakfast could ve been better more selection would ve been nice and we wernt allowed to take any breakfast with us on our day trip so had to go without 
 small rooms
 travelled in november and it was really cold in our room but with an extra heater the problem was solved 
 found lacking attention to details in the rooms 
 firstly i was put in a superior deluxe room on the ground floor and i could feel the vibrations of the tube underneath so was moved to 1st floor disabled room which ok but equipped for a person in a wheelchair the carpets and skirting boards were stained and dirty the towel rail fell off and then the inside of the wardrobe collapsed the hotel is shabby and cheap and no way near worthy of a 4 star 
 can t really think of something i didn t like it was all good 
 the internet hardly worked at all in the end i had to find an internet cafe to sent emails and book onward travels watching any english channels were disrupted constantly the staff at the hotel were helpful by printing out tickets the shower leaked so me and my friend were walking on wet floors although there was tea coffee in the room theses were not refilled so we had to buy this at the bar did complain to the hotel management and was i was impressed that they responded with a 25 euro discount 
 arriving to be told i had paid for 2 rooms booking didn t go through first time so tried again 3 weeks later successfully the hotel won t reimburse you booking com wont reimburse after taking money out twice booking com is a rip off be very careful 
 a bigger room would be better but it w as ok
 just a bit pricey
 no place to open the suitcase other than the bed 
 nothing not to like 
 poor general standard certainly not 4 star
 the room is a little too small
 needed a curtain between bedroom and sitting areas budget toilet roll 
 staff were friendly but inefficient and made the stay less relaxing than it should have been was messed about so much with the rooms booking was lost and payment was taken without my authorisation this meant that i couldn t inform her that i wanted to pay cash or pay from my austrian account rather than the english one connected with my booking which has resulted in my accounts being messed up massively so unprofessional and a huge lack of communication between staff evidently 
 the hotel is old 
 breakfast was average at best
 there is only one elevator which is a bit small 
 problems to find parking i central milano but it is not a hotelproblem 
 poor and too expensive breakfast 
 place in dire need of an upgrade decor and furnishings are all old creaking floor boards kept us up could hear neighbours sneeze 
 closet space could be larger to handle winter outerwear 
 room we got was a bit small and view not good
 nothing
 nothing 
 no water pressure in the shower poor bedding terrible room service food 
 not a bad experience but thought 195 00 per night without breakfast was a little steep 
 i really can t think of anything bad about this hotel 
 the room is tied not functioning well room service need improvement we had to ask them to refill tissue and toilet paper we had to change the room 2 times for 4 days stay one time for the room view was on the next building construction and second time because of ac problem 
 old fashioned design classic small elevator 
 we got a room under the central heating vacuuming ventilation something which made so much noise that you can t sleep in that room after complaining we got a different room i just can t understand they can rent this room out ever 
 bed was uncomfortable and the wifi was inconsistent 
 no warning of fire alarm testing 
 roomservice you forgot what i ordered and never came with it and you also didn t know what you had to offer one minute i was ordering pizza the next you didn t have any and an hour later i still got my pizza make it straight and you need to fix your cards that opens the door stopped working a lot and maybe if you guys are offering shampoos then maybe you should think about conditioner as well maybe even some body lotion it s supposed to be like that at good hotels some of your taxi drivers are also crazy 
 since there is no place in the neighborhood to eat after 22 00 and in the hotel no bar restaurant nor room service after 23 00 i think a vending machine would work also a remark to the cleaning staff if the towels are not to be changed please don t relocate them we need to know which one is who s finally there is something like a communal funeral service of barcelona very close by one block away if someone gets frustrated around these things they should avoid the particular route of the main entrance and enter the hotel the other way 
 the wifi wasn t great connection coming and going which was very annoying since it was a work trip there was a smell of smoke through the ventilation in the room at night like cigarettes the room was very small for a 4 star hotel breakfast for 17 that s the reason i never had breakfast in the hotel 
 hotel overall was fine unfortunately our room was awful g5 it was tiny nothing like any of photographs noisy due to been on street level so constant traffic noise dark and dingy with no space the bed was pushed up against window with a table next to it which you had to climb over to get into bed the tv was on the wall at the left side of the bed so impossible to watch clearly a failed attempt at adding another room 
 only small downfall and this is me being mega picky maybe think about adding breakfast 
 poor welcome at reception and given wrong room key so had to return from 5 the floor to get replacement heating sensor in room broken so arrival temperature was 32 degrees reported it no action taken tea and coffee facilities not topped up most solid and uncomfortable pillows i ve ever had generally felt that hotel was trying to be a boutique hotel but failed just seemed as if nothing quite worked and staff certainly weren t at a level that one would expect for that cost compared to other wembley hotels massively overpriced 
 room bathroom
 nothing
 the boutique socks unfriendly attendants not conducive to a sale 
 room was quite dusty and shabby hot water ran out both mornings of our stay and seemed to be a regular occurance on contacting reception problem was rectified but we had to wait 15 20 mins for water to get hot annoying delay to start of our day 
 the breakfast is very basic it is just ok renovation is being done in the hotel there is no lobby because it is being renovated there is no lunch or dinner they have no chief the breakfast is brought from another place there is only small left and you gave to climb stairs to reach it i guess that it must be the service left and the main left is in the area being renovated 
 our room wasn t ready when we arrived so the guy at reception said he would bring the key up to us in 15 mins while we waited next door in our teenagers room half an hour passed no sign of the key so we went downstairs to check and another receptionist gave us the key instead 
 all comdoms on my window seal
 room was always very cold 4 out of 7 days we sis not have hot water in room and indoor pool water was very cold
 nothing
 it is a shame there is not a good restaurant but really just a cafe extension to the bar the rooms are comfortable and clean but they are decorated in that bland grey way of all hotels these days a bit more shoreditch originality would be welcome 
 the location is a little bit far from central london yet the hotel is very close to the dlr line so it is still okay going to leicester square it took us around 35 min our room was next to another room and therefore there was a door connect two rooms although there were 2 doors to prevent the residents in other room to enter the noise of the other room was quite obvious and annoying 
 i wasn t informed that they would be taking a reservation payment out of my account 60 more than the actual cost of the room for the night
 guest room does not have free wifi 
 a pity about the sewer smell in the streets no adverse smells in the hotel though thank goodness 
 check in too late left luggage full 30 mins wait returned later check in again 6 o clock left luggage closed promised 2 bottles of water in bedroom did not arrive reception undermanned won t be returning 
 nothing everything was first class
 poor decor of our room the shower tray looked like something had been left to burn on it the flush button on toilet was not clean 
 the lady knocked on the door about 9 30 and let herself in check out was 12
 the pictures don t exactly reflect the dimension of the rooms 
 nothing we were both very happy and plan to stay again
 slightly noisey at night if you are a light sleeper then you may get disturbed by other guests returning or noise from the street 
 our room was very small and this wasn t reflected in the images on the site it was far from superior for the price we paid i felt that we could have gotten somewhere nicer we must have been below some sort of water boiler as it was very noisy at night time resulting in a poor sleep 
 rude staff dirty room room was not ready until 4pm sent to a dirty room first 
 nothing all good
 no minifridge
 we had to leave early and had paid for breakfast in advance so they wanted to charge 7e for us to request a takeaway coffee and croissant this was extremely disappointing as they should have honoured this in good faith for nothing forfeiting a full breakfast already paid in return for a croissant and coffee takeaway at 6am surely is no hardship and they win regardless so not even doing this for no charge let alone an additional charge this let the hotel down in my opinion and i m in the hotel industry 
 we had to wait around half hour for our room to be prepared even though we could check in after 2 we still had to wait although the staff we re apologetic and offered us tea and coffee it was still a nuisance to wait longer the bed was comofortable unfortunately there was holes in walls and black marks on the wall that was a little disappointing 
 the room had no small refrigerator
 1 the toilet is always wet after a shower as there is no shower door to prevent the water from splashing 2 wifi connection weak 
 the hotel is in energy saving mode lights only work while in the room no fridge showers don t have doors water gets everywhere service is not of major importance but all of amsterdam is that way breakfast is just ok but across the street is the breakfast club and they re really good the metro shuts down at 1am i was able to walk home from the red light district twice but while intoxicated it s a hike 
 wifi not so efficent and the room wasnt very clean lastly the day of my check out the front desk lady informed me that there was no help for my luggage to be brought diwn 
 hotel is very tired and needs a revamp feels about 10years behind has a horrid smell in the lobby from the spa and pool below staff at the pool bar almost non existent has the potential to be amazing again 
 our floor had a strong smell of sewerage or gas 7th 
 that we could not stay longer 
 limited breakfast 
 nothing
 breakfast
 strange noise in the room from seiling and walls windy outsite 
 wifi connection and 1 unfriendly staff
 the bed was extremely uncomfortable
 nothing 
 everything is average about this place location staff facility comfort would not go back they make you pay the day you arrive 
 no power sockets by beds
 nothing 
 cheaper bar prices won t happen 
 bed
 car park is very expensive
 the staff was not polite not flexible lost between computers angry a girl slow my name was even not spelled on the guest list was noted with one capital letter on the reception was usually nobody etc 
 difficult to deal with lights air conditioning could be better
 nothing it was brilliant 
 we spoke to 2 separate front desk employees on 2 different days about the trains running to the airport for our return neither said anything about what appears to be a well publicized rail workers strike that greatly impacted our trip we would have taken a cab or shuttle if we had known 
 n a
 nothing to say we ll come back
 needs a bar
 it was too noisy we keep hearing high heel steps day and night one of the reciptionists was a bit mean
 nothing everything was so amazing that i m planning to come back very soon 
 coffee could have been hotter 
 the customer service was appalling the receptionist on arrival only checked us into one room and cancelled the other then demanded full payment when arriving back on the night the receptionist was rude and extremely unhelpful the girls on the reception desk the next morning were extremely apologetic and tried to help but it was too late 
 nothing 
 nothing
 nothing at all 
 wifi in room charge
 the air conditioning system could have been a bit quieter 
 overpriced 
 it wasn t very central in amsterdam but we knew this before going and there was a tram stop directly outside the hotel the tram is runs very frequently and is cheap
 however the little touches within the room were not quite right for one of their premier rooms the bed mattress was very hard not even medium firm but very firm indeed most importantly the pillows were also very firm unforgiving variety not commensurate with such an expensive and nice suite this led to a poor nights sleep you would expect natural down feather pillows of a high comfort quality not one s your head literally bounces off no easy plug lead arrangement for hairdryer to mirror dressing table that we could work out most disappointingly on returning from the albert hall quite late but not early hours late 11pm the two evening reception staff informed us the bar was shut nor did they even offer us a nightcap drink which one might expect at a london hotel such as this at this time of evening 
 nothing
 we like to walk but the area is far from the city however a ten minute walk gets you to the metro which is wonderful 
 old fashioned hotel out of date over expensive room considering size a global refurbishment is needed urgently i do not recommand this hotel for the price 
 although the location of the hotel is pretty central there are a lot of strange people walking around trying to sell something people fighting screaming and also a lot of homeless people so i would not recommend to walk around this area when it s late or if you are alone 
 we made an order at the vondelpark branch of the hotel our reservation was for 2 executive rooms with a connecting door and it was confirmed to us by the hotel via booking com prior to our arrival upon arrival we have discovered that the hotel does not have such rooms after no other alternative was available we have agreed not to completely ruin our vacation to take a suite at the victoria hotel at the city center needless to say this had significantly negative impacted our vacation stepping out to the vondelpark area is a lot different than stepping out to damrak street especially with a child with a disability for which the vondelpark location was chosen to begin with 
 the room was very small without any windows it was freezing and the heating was on maximum 
 the quality of the room was not up to par with the rest of the hotel there was paint chipping off the wall and an extremely questionable couch i wouldn t stay there again 
 the bathroom was not that clean and the flush mechanism on the toilet did not work properly the room curtains were torn some of the powerpoints did not work 
 being made to wait in the foyer for half an hour for our room to be prepared the cleanliness tide mark round the sink the size of the room for the money paid wasn t a pleasant stay really 
 drinks were very expensive including soft drinks
 n a
 stale biscuits at coffee station during business meeting 
 nothing to report
 the view was awful as we were in a room looking into the centre of the hotel i have stayed here before and had a view of station which i must say was preferable
 zimmerkomfort
 bathroom could have been a little larger showerscreen far too small 
 a few minor but important details no coffee unless you paid 19 for their continental breakfast that was majorly weird and disappointing for a four star hotel also what seems to be a steamy hot tub room is really a very pleasantly temperature pool no way to put it in hot water and no way to turn up the temperature we had a great time down there but it was disappointing at first i thought it was really a spa where we could steam and so forth thinking of it more of a private pool made it a lot more fun 
 the standard rooms were extremely too small for two adults i ve to upgrade to a bigger room as i am tall person
 wardrobe space minimal and no chair staffing levels in restaurant inadequate and poor customer awareness tables too close together 
 hotel is very far from city centre in a residential office building area practically no restaurants in the area if you arrive late you should eat before you go to the hotel apart from the fresh juicer breakfast was a bit dissapointing
 nothing
 oops forgot to supply tea tray and breakfast not pre ordered so took too long
 just right
 we enjoyed every part of our stay our only recommendation is for a better map of the area with larger print for us older folks 
 nothing
 wifi didn t work well in our room 
 the chambermaid keep providing us only 1 face towel and shower towel when there are 2 of us this happened on our 4th and 5th night stay 
 having to leave we look forward to booking a return visit soon it is a very popular location so near the flower market transportation the museum district and yes the red light district 
 waiters didn t do upon request they have to be more hospitable 
 nothing in the fridge
 the rooms carpets were very used
 the only thing was avarage was the wi fi it was complicated to get on line 
 room was a little bit cramped
 nothing at all it was a wonderful experience 
 small room
 on corridor carpet some dirt had been on some room doors also had damaged no slippers in room
 the staff were not entirely welcoming and friendly 
 none
 we can see teh bathroom directly from the bed through the window this suits only for the couple not for the business 
 breakfast cold 
 the 5th floor family suite room rate was quite expensive and we could see only the top of eiffel 
 terrible room on second night tiny and couldn t move within bathroom one set of bathrobe slippers etc no consistency in the size of rooms and set up 
 it was all really very good all round 
 breakfast is not really for 5 star very basic 
 poor value for money food and rooms are too expensive 
 we were in room 114 which is nothing like it shows in the display picture whilst i understand these things are bound to be varied the bedding decorations were nothing alike the room was small which was fine for the two of us but the window was tucked right round a corner which was opposite a wall so there was no natural light in the room whatsoever the window that they did have back out into a tiny space full of water pipes and wires with an engine of somesort that gave off an annoying buzzing noise the bathroom door was partically see through so you can see your partner sat on the toilet which we didn t really care around but it s just a bit odd on arrival the manager was incredibly rude when i mentioned it would of been cheaper to book on the day rather than in advance she went on to say well obviously here in london which is one of the most popular and beautiful cities in the world the prices can differ everyday we re from the midlands not the other side of the world we know how these things and work in the industry so didn t appreciate being patronised also it s great to have workers that speak different languages but when they can t even understand english speaking customers it isn t not brilliant 
 understandably so the building is very old and needs to be renter they did i was informed that it would be rented renovated but the cleanliness of the hallway it was unacceptable from the moment i arrive until the time that i left i was right across from one of the maintenance areas and there was lots of debris from the maintenance staff or house cleaning staff
 renovations were in progress did not spoil our holiday but would had been nice to be informed of renovations before booking 
 food and drinks was very expensive bed was a little hard
 the bar area seemed more like a corridor 
 wifi is slow
 we all love to complain but here i have nothing to say 
 style over function very attractive but only large mirror was in the bathroom so no help with drying hair all subdued lighting with no option of bright light for reading or work could not reach bedside table from bed large bathroom but nowhere to keep towels nearby whilst in the shower to reach when needed shower was like rinsing hair in a rain shower no power to it all looks lovely but designers should try staying in it for 24 hours and spot the drawbacks 
 i knew it was a small room but it was really no more than a cupboard i am only 1 63m and i could just about touch both sides of the room also i could hardly turn around in the shower it was also far too hot and even with a fan provided by reception i had a poor nights sleep 
 the lighting in the room was abit dark even with the curtains open other than that all good 
 rooms are super small not even a desk is available in the room nor a chair just a bed bathroom amenities are minimal the room cleaners dont know their job and move everything around they even opened our suitcases which was very odd 
 the haircare amenities were tiny we kept having to request more i felt that the toilet and bathroom tile weren t being thoroughly cleaned over the course of our entire stay 
 i had booked a hotel with parking they don t have any it s a unlock park 300 meters away ah well beside that great place to stay 
 the location of the hotel is the only small inconvenience we had getting trams to the centre and not missing the last one home we were told there was a night bus but we didn t brave it 
 n a
 room could do with a little renovation bathroom was very small
 not sure about wifi
 apparently you can t adjust use the aircon in march and so i ended up with a fan in my room and whilst i understand there are cost implications polyester sheets and synthetic duvets are rarely conducive to a good night s sleep and especially when it s warm in a 4 hotel i d prefer cotton and down 
 noise from dlr ran right next to where our room was located in the hotel and ran all through the night so not much sleep
 our room had a bad functioning ac and the noice from the very busy traffic on the street was quite disturbing 
 had to wait 30 minutes to check in was told the double room i had booked had been sold to someone else so i was in a twin room room was freezing with no ability to turn off the air conditioning tried to order food but nobody available wifi didn t work absolutely terrible stay 
 it is expensive absence of car park
 25 minutes waiting time for check out 
 the shopping my wife loves
 the fact that if you arrived a few minutes late for breakfast you weren t allowed to get any food even to eat in the lobby only after complaints did we get our breakfast 
 room was small i requested an upgrade but wasn t an option no view just rooftops room small breakfast overpriced so we opted to eat at great place round the corner for less than half the price
 the room has no window the first room i saw was tiny and there there people partying and shouting to each luther of their window while smoking it s a non smoking hotel resraurant was terrible empty and served no wine or beer
 nothing
 shower a c 
 i wasn t too hyped that i was in the wheelchair accessible room because all the amenities were oddly low and the security guard at night was rude and didn t believe i was staying there when i came back late from a bar the elevators take forever to call in the morning 
 wifi garage
 nothing
 bit of a mistake sending champagne and cake to our room compliments of the hotel only to find out 5mins later wasn t for us and it all got taken away thankfully we hadn t touched it bit of a make you feel special then not so special 
 advice with respect to public transport would be really appreciated
 bed uncomfortable
 some of the staff the mother i guess could be a bit more hospitable 
 non 
 the room was very small not much space at all we didn t have clean towels the whole two days we stayed not much selection in the restaurant for dinner and the fact that they charge you for literally everything is very off putting considering the price that you pay to stay there you get charged just for the staff to pour you a drink 
 very close to centre of london
 weather haha
 was upgraded but given a small bed so it was a bit tight it is also a huge hotel so there are many guests and as a result some long waits at check in and for the lifts 
 nothing 
 room a bit too warm at night
 the lift wasn t working the staff did offer to help with bags though 
 room 1029 was noisy and dark both due to the air con units positioned right outside the windows i couldn t open the windows as it was too noisy and couldn t sleep in the airless room as the air con dries out my throat when asked to check in online room 1029 was the only one i could check into very unhappy
 cooked breakfast could have been hotter 
 the room was very small especially the bath room and that unfortunately is the downside of the place 
 room too small difficult getting around bed could not sit on toilet comfortably because wall to close to toilet pan
 no late checkout not acceptable visitors in room
 not much close to do walking g distance from the hotel you always have to get a tram 
 the pool was broken during my 1 night stay there 
 when the booking was eventually sorted out we were told that it only included 1 breakfast despite the booking having been made for 2 people we had to pay the extra so that we could have breakfast together the fault for this was it seems with booking com and i would appreciate your response 
 the only issue for us that there wasn t any tea spoons and small plates in the room but were given when requested
 minor things really that didn t detract from the overall stay couple of things could easily be improved night light did not work and the full length mirror was behind the desk which made it difficult to use 
 clean should be classify exactly time
 area should of research this hotel more abit to far then what i thought over looks the motorway so you get woken up early due to the noise of the motorway traffic if your room overlooks that way like mine did 
 reception area is a bit small so not suitable to meet and greet people 
 price
 bathroom was extremely small
 the room was incredibly small it was the smallest double room i ve ever stayed in with the smallest en suite there was barely 4 inches between the bed and the wardrobe to get around the bed the bed was practically up against the en suite door which had a sliding door as there wasn t room for a for to open 
 bar prices 
 different type of room than i ordered cheaper dirty toilet seat shards of glass in the bathroom
 housekeeping services and team are poor under beds are full of rubbish rooms are dusty and beds are way too old and worn out they upgraded me when i complained however i was not satisfied with cleaniness of the room only 2 elevators serving the entire hotel guests staff most of staff were trainees therefore service was poor
 eastway service can be a little slow sometimes 
 the air conditioning was quite noisy but other than that everything was fie it would have been nice to have had breakfast mayby next time very enjoyable
 nothing
 very cold room and door lock was not working
 the staff are the worse staff ever unable unprepared arrogant inadeguate and rude they just don t have a clue about how to deal with customers if they don t understand your question they would try to talk to you like you were deaf restaurant doesn t have any alcohol licence but they won t tell you until you are sit way overpriced and low quality arrogant and rude people just don t go there 
 nothing
 a bit noisy
 noise
 pillows were a little firm two people trying to manoeuvre around the room at the same time was challenging 
 felt a bit overpriced the lift was out of service at the time of my stay but they kindly helped me bring up my bags admittedly this took a while though and i had to come back down to check that they were bringing them up 
 when i booked i requested gluten free food and it was in capital letters on the booking form when booking in at reception i enquired about the gluten free bread at breakfast and was told that there would be some the first morning was fine but on sunday we went to breakfast at 9 30 ordered gluten free toast the waiter said after 10 mins when i enquired that it was on its way but after 20 mins he came back to say there wasn t any but did i want any other sort of bread i am a coeliac and cannot eat any other sort of bread breakfast finishes at 11am so the catering for gluten free was very poor and after all i had requested at the time of booking 
 breakfast not included in the package no room service or catering service i had to go downstairs to get an ice bucket and plates 
 wifi was terrible
 nothing
 shower is very tight and really not comfortable at all
 four star rating does not feel correct more two three star bright pink doors everywhere and you feel you have walked in to an eightys timewarp the decor is worn chipped marked and beds had black tape on the scuffs holes watermarks present from leaking radiators bath chipped all over bottom bathrooms based in bedrooms smelt of drains 
 hotel was extremely cold all room and general areas were pre set to 21 degrees 
 pillows were too big and uncomfortable cleaners took our 2nd key when cleaning so had to use 1 for electricity and to enter lift 
 nothing at all
 quality of food at breakfast was poor stale bread rolls sweaty cheese unappetising meats 
 the shower took a while to warm up and there was an issue with the food in saturday but the staff are really nice it just seems a little over priced 
 rude check in staff
 all good nothing to dislike
 lovely room very clean staff very helpful only inconvenience was the christmas party going on close by was quite noisey 
 the elevator was broken luckily we were only on floor 1
 need to pay 10 pound for 1 hour late check out even though having notified hotel in advance other hotels we stayed do not need to pay 10 pound for 1 hour late check out they are free for 1 hour late check out 
 everything was perfect 
 nothing 
 thought we had breakfast included but didn t an extremely expensive hotel so did expect to have something like breakfast inlcuded rather than paying so much for a room exchange rate changed by the time we were there and the difference was huge also so pay upfront when booking not allowed to reserve a table for drinks at the rooftop meaning both nights we went up we could not sit down and therefore weren t allowed to have a drink whilst standing staff tried to accommodate but we went elsewhere after waiting as we were a group of 11 
 free wi fi its only 256 kb the connection unstable lobby of the hotel looks great and impressive but when you go to your floor its definitely not 4 star 
 no iron in the room cloth ironing 
 the terrace was not how it looked in the picture it looked quite messy
 i wish the room rate was a bit lower 
 breakfast
 unclean in dining areas
 the room was only just slightly bigger than the double bed so no room to move at all worst of all though the plug socket was broken and i got electrocuted while i was trying to plug in phone charger when i complained to reception they said absolutely nothing and the manager wasn t around to speak to i have been waiting almost a week now for them to call me as every time i call them the manager is not available they are lucky it wasn t a child or someone with existing health problems who touch plug socket or this could have been a lot more serious 
 lighting was poor in room maid helped her self to food left in room a c did not work 
 although the hotel is a little out of the way central london is easily accessible via transport links we had no other concerns with the hotel or its amenities
 poor wifi
 the rooms are very small rather expensive but i guess still value for the money
 my credit card has been charged twice and still in the process of being sorted out the young receptionist didn t know if she was coming or going when i booked the 7rooms in november i thought i was just reserving it not paying for them all and going overdrawn and it costing me 12 00
 the reception staff had different solutions for one problem only few of them speak english expensive parking 15 night for hotel clients no international tv channels and wi fi does not connect but it s free for two hours during your stay no matter the nights the rooms do not include maps for tourists or any other information guide about the city 
 breakfast cafe americano 
 rooms were compact no coffee and tea facilities 
 just a bath we were only there one night so hard to judge as didn t use many of the facilities
 a window permanently open in the room 
 very poor internet in room
 price of alcoholic drinks
 nothing
 no bar
 not too vegan vegetarian friendly not recommendable for solo travellers lots of noisy families over crowded elevators i actually had to use the emergency stairs 
 you have to walk down a hill to get to it back up if you want to get to bus 
 our room had two plug points and both were in awkward places 
 i can t fault anything except room and bathroom was very compact only thing you could have improved on was that we would have liked more than one teabag each 
 our room was facing inside an atrium in the central section of the hotel with no view so that you felt as though you had no window and since the atrium was open to every floor noise travelled upstairs 
 building work under way but was not informed when we booked for food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor 
 internet facilities and staff
 room too small but adequate
 pillows were small and somewhat uncomfortable 
 the shower and toilet are in two separate rooms the shower is just around the corner in the bedroom bit strange 
 poor service particularly in the bar had to ask 3 times for a bottle of water one evening the staff seem to be rushing around and everything seemed uncoordinated offered a complimentary cocktail but after a meal and several drinks at the bar and restaurant they took the money off the cheaper glasses of cava we had not the cocktails waited ages for the food to arrive only offer complimentary bottles of water in the room on the first night really not impressed with our overall experience here and will not be returning 
 room had a drain problem
 leaving the hotel 
 no coffee maker in room
 breakfast buffet choice a little bit disappointing
 the shower was weiredly positioned
 the food in the bar was very expensive and not very nice there were no biscuits in the room and we were not given any cookies at reception as other travellers have suggested you get 
 none 
 the bathroom could have been cleaner the shower kept scalding us every few mins very dangerous for kids babies the electricity in our room was a mess the first day we only had 1 plug that worked until someone came up to fix it 
 the room was very warm even with the radiator off the first room we were in was extremely small we did upgrade to a larger room
 tv was small and had to be paid for
 a little bit noisy through the night from outside the next night we closed the room window and it wasn t quite as bad 
 nothing
 brekfast and staff in dinning room very rude again did not get his name
 its not the cheapest hotel in the world but then again it s on park lane 
 room is a little small 
 the breakfast was cold we ate at 0730 and despite the ood just being cooked it was cold 
 nothing but be careful of the pickpockets in the underground station taking a bus would be a better choice 
 the lack of alcohol could have done with more options for coffee and some proper milk for having tea as there was only creamer available you can ask for these though to be fair 
 the bed was very uncomfortable 
 check in and out times different but overall was a brilliant hotel
 doesnt feel like good value for money but hey this is paris also the room was much smaller than expected but hey hey this is paris 
 old and very smelly food at breakfast cool in the buffet
 a bit old
 service at bar in the evening was slow only 1 person trying to do restaurant and bar waited 30 mins for a few fries but this was only a minor problem 
 distance from the centre but metro very close and easy to get around town all the same 
 reception staff that did not care our son was ill and needed a straw for drinking their reply was bar is closed not a single attempt to help at the end of the stay they gave me a wrong parking ticket that made me pay 39 euro extra for parking small apology but no reimbursment will never go there again overall impression of a bad 2 star hotel 
 it was very noisy during night due to location of room
 room had no view from window as shaded due to right opposite another room i really did not like lack of natural light the room needs better lighting to compensate
 slightly dated 
 nothing
 nothing
 facilities and food
 the scales had broken before i stood on them 
 room was slightly cramped restaurant food was nice but over priced for what it was bar closed at 10pm on the sunday night 
 staff attitude
 the door between the bedroom and the lobby where the door to the bathroom is situated could not be shut as it crashed into the bed and therefore had to remain propped open with a chair which resulted in the reduced access to the desk 
 would have liked more milk checking in was difficult saw two different members of staff conflicting procedures disappointing that wifi wasn t free 
 leaking shower the only bad thing constantly wet floor in the hallway is a bit disappointing 
 breakfast tables are a bit cramped for all the food that is served to your table unfortunately the furniture in the bedroom is laid out really badly for example my bedside table concealed the safety box which only left one small drawer to use the only other set of drawers was next to the other side of the bed which was difficult to access and not sufficient space the safety box did not work properly the batteries were flat but even changing them couldn t make it work the tv channels in english consisted of cnn news and nothing else the bath shower was small and narrow with a half glass door which meant water spilled all over the floor toilet seat with each shower 
 all good
 nothing
 execellant hotel
 parking cost front desk always crowded queue for check in check out request info need a refresh
 the hotel is ok but one would have expected something better in view of the price and the star rating the breakfast is ridiculously overpriced the staff assured that breakfast is offered free of charge to those who book dirctly with the hotel 
 didn t have a universal socket for the docking station therefore couldn t listen to music from iphone not easy finding our room number on arrival
 location is not the best for tourism weirdly the toilet was too high i am 5 5 and my toes just touch the ground the sliding door to the bathroom is very heavy and hard to open and close and although the sink tub shower hardware is beautiful it is difficult to use if hands are wet or have lotion on and lastly the tub is so big you cannot lay back and relax without sliding down under the water unless you are a good 6 tall 
 booked this hotel mainly because it said sound proofed rooms this was not the case noises from other rooms 
 i have scars from the glass door in the bathroom the door swings out the way and catches the top of your foot beware also on check out we were accused of drinking the beverages in the fridge when we didn t they have an automatic sensor so don t even touch them room was smaller than the pictures but it was okay television did not work the worst for us was the keycard for the lift 15 mins average time trying too open the lift it just would not accept the key cards a lot off improvements to be done in this hotel 
 the hotel does not have a parking it has a garage but it is full all the time and even if you ask in the reservation for one still not receive it in addition i left my car at 3 km distance in a public parking and when i left i brought the car in front of the hotel for 5 minutes until i got in the room after the storage and when i returned i had in window a 36 euros amend for parking this hotel is a 4 stars hotel but i do not give him more than 3 
 no space at all extremely small room even more extremely small bathroom the carpet in the room just outside the bathroom door has a constantly wet area that never dries 
 food was horrible
 everything i like the place small but nice the breakfast even i m asian but i enjoyed very much
 great hotel great service but they really let the side down with really poor blow dryers at 150 per night one would expect an up to date blow dryer with a nozzle this one sounded like it was about to explode 
 the staff were fine or arrival but by no means the friendliest there is no restaurant only a bar the bar is fit for purpose but rather small and the tv was on the whole time not a great atmosphere cocktails over priced for the quality during our stay start of christmas season there was a big leak in the ceiling of the bar no mention of it nor apology we ate in the hotel which is ok for a snack look elsewhere if you want really decent meal 
 extra charge for everything 30 00 for breakfast a bit much 5 00 for bucket of ice really probably not the best place when traveling with kids 
 bathroom logistics no place to hang bathrobes if you sit on the toilet your partner can clearly see you from the bedroom the top floor bar staff is rude and arrogant all the others are really nice instead 
 i dont like breakfast need more various
 no water in the room other than in the minibar 
 it seems that the majority of staff doesn t know how to prepare coffee quality of the product is very good but the production varied dramatically unfortunately staff in the roof bar couldn t handle my complaint at all cappucino tasted like water
 the bar is a bit small
 the towels must be renewed 
 didn t like the breakfast charges 19 euro each person 
 bathroom floor was so badly scratched even though i emailed regarding the two of us staying the room seemed to be equipped for one person with one towel robe one coffee cup 1 spoon etc when returning on sat night we requested a fork and it did not arrive 
 maybe it has been a 4 star hotel but not anymore very rundown dirty matts 
 location but not much can be done about it 
 leaving 
 people should note that the management ignores the message one writes on booking com when booking for example we specifically asked to be given a room in the third or upper floors indicating in capital letters to avoid the first and second floors and they never got back the room we were given was on the second floor otherwise all was ok 
 bath rooms very small any slightly fat person can not fit in the shower capsule pictures of the rooms lobby toilets shown at the time of booking does not reflect what is actual size of room and baths it simply misguidesgood 
 nescaf machine as the only possibility to have a coffee for breakfast really hard mattress necessity to ask for towels at the main reception when going to 7th floor jacuzzi area poor level of english at the reception hard to explain them what we want
 very dated rooms charges for internet were outrageous
 fire door in corridor kept banging really annoying 
 we paid for a executive room so we could use the lounge we found the lounge poor compared to other lounges we have used no vegetarian food on offer and when i asked if they could provide something was told no the complimentary wine under lock and key and have to keep asking if you would like a drink hardly anything on offer to eat and breakfast was poor we have used executive lounges at the marriott chain and at the millenium hotel in london and were far better and offered so much more they don t even offer nibbles such as nuts and crisps to have with your drinks just a jar of hazelnuts 
 the bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe 
 ac was a problem on the warm nights we had it didn t work properly and you have no control over it in the room breakfast ok plenty of choice of items but the quality wasn t what you d expect 
 quality of the toilet lid cracked 
 i was disappointed with the evening meal the service was great but the meal was quite tasteless 
 price of the hotel is quite exspensive for just two nights
 i was told on arrival would receive a free birthday cocktail voucher along with balloons for my partner we did not receive this we went down for breakfast was seated quick enough but waited over 15 mins to be served i had to go up to waitress at kitchen to ask if could place our order from then on ordered breakfast in bed as service was poor in restaurant 
 not to the standard of other double tree hilton hotels substandard room poor customer service 
 the window can no avoid the voice from street it is not quite at night 
 nothing
 to few staff to provide an efficient service and staff seemed inexperienced and confused at times
 nothing really
 outside dirty room small cramped could not even walk around bed room grubby dirty bathroom shower moldy breakfast poor not value for money 2 start not 4 star
 bar staff in particular was very very average 
 bit cold in bathroom and restaurant
 when we drive to hotel we ask to charge our electro car men from desk said that it is not problem but when we chek out our car was not charging it was only 25 km in our tesla for five star hotel this service is very bad becouse loose a lot of time for charge our car in vienna 
 not crazy about the pink and flower decorations no biggie
 room smelled a little of smoke 
 dining options a little pricey for what you get open shower seems cool at first until you get water everywhere 
 not as equipped as i would expect for this price the room was a bit dim and there was no kettle and it was a bit cold with heating and quilts 
 bed too soft
 wifi was on and off
 cold water off milk in room and when complained reception still charged me 19 for half a lager and small glass of wine no good will gesture seems to be all about how much they can get from you once you re there selling a different room for an extra 80 in front of my partner can feel a little uncomfortable and puts you in a position of being a cheap skate after paying 150 already for a room only 
 stayed in room 555 beautiful room and bed tea and coffee looked like they had been there for years and literally fell apart in my hands milk was out of date and came out green constant cooing noise outside the window literally couldnt sleep and a terrible draft 
 bathroom poor too small and the washbasin was outside more or less in the bedroom air conditioning heating impossible to regulate aircon made a terrible whistling noise on our last night lasted 20 minutes
 a small room is really small showers don t have shower curtains 
 the security could have been better with key for elevator and maybe a door waiter 
 not welcome service
 out heater in our room was not working in the end we were given a portable heater some blankets 
 always be aware of the city tax which is 5 euro per person per night in milan what is not included booking via booking com and too bad we did not get the room with the bath but later we realized the room was so big and with shower because it was handicap room
 n a
 housekeeping was dreadful had to find her in the hotel daily to ask for toilet roll and towels 
 the rooms are small but it is central london 
 wifi charge at 20 dai is simply ridiculous these days it should be free in any hotel 
 the shower space is far too small it is very uncomfortable also no soap shampoo etc in the bathroom 
 wifi is so so room is not so big the indigo parking is very expensive
 room quite small
 the housekeeping not professional at all they took some gifts that i bought to my family i recognized that when i was on my way to the airport and there is no way to go back to the hotel so i called the hotel to complain they said we are very sorry but what can we do for that excuse me 
 slight confusion at check in and deposit credit wasn t processed same day as check out payment 
 it was quite noisy at night with delivery vans
 breakfast with frozen vegetables and very old boiled eggs nothing fresh at all i m really sorry becouse i did not make any photos come on guys we are in 2016 and you pretend to own a 4 hotel for sure after each breakfast session they freeze every slice of ham cheese vegetables i never saw such a way the boiled eggs has a very strange colour and smell it was some mozarella on the tray and tomatoes with ice snow flakes on them normally price is 15 euro we had special offer and pay 9 euros person including a 5 years child in rest nothing to make you happy in the room old dust in every corner it seems the clean lady make it in a different way old tv and strange zzzound i will not reccomand this hotel especially the breakfast people can get sick from that 
 rooms are a little small spa cannot be used if someone has booked a massage everything else is very good
 sadly couldn t get the coffee maker to work 
 rooms are a bit small
 rude staff in 20 twenty bar and room smells of cigarettes
 not very clean bed uncomfortable very noisy but that can t really be helped with noise from outside 
 the room is small the service was very slow and it at times none was provided at all complimentary water at day one only the hotel is too expensive for what it offers wasn t pleasant experience don t think i will be going back again 
 standing shower getting loosed and the warm water was not quite in quick response 
 nothing
 the guy selling tourist bus tickets inside the hotel will give you face if you don t buy it for him he doesn t take credit card he offer you 2 discount if you pay cash by the way isn t true the tickets cost 32 all over we bought it cross the street and right there is the bus stop 
 the noise coming from building works under the hotel i was planning to sleep in the morning being on holidays but impossible from 10am onward 
 the location is good if you plan to see the whole gaudi but if you orient to spend the most of the time in the old city or near the sea this is not the best choice but still a good one 
 small room small bathroom bed small
 rude staff at reception and every day we wake up at 09 00 because we had to clean the room 
 room actually small outdated and the decor needs a re think the lamps were bigger than the bed
 the bathroom doors glass panels that don t fully seal are a little awkward for friends 
 waiting 40mins for our bags to be delivered to our room 
 nothing
 my only complaint is the property s design is so modern and minimal that they re lacking some major necessities like towel bars counter space and drawers for clothes 
 rooms on the street side are much noisier than rooms on the other side 
 location price the hotel should give me king size bad i m with my son 7years 
 the bed was short for me 
 bathroom smelled very musty the hotel is huge and quite impersonal breakfast room vast doesn t quit live up to it s stars the second guoman hotel i ve stayed in that was quite disappointing 
 loved everything 
 nothing
 breakfast like warm
 stains on hallway carpets smell of smoke in room free internet too slow to use google maps room in desperate need of new carpet furniture shower curtain to replace moldy curtain and bathroom mackup
 my single room was quite compact i had asked for a quiet room and although i was not disturbed by other guests the generator was quite noisy all night 
 the receptionists asked if i wanted to pay to access the drinks in the room only to find the fridge was actually empty when we arrived
 hotel s restaurant was very expensive and both breakfast and dinner were not good at all it was also very noisy making meals even worse 
 hotel took 50 holding fee and then did not release it back to me even though there was no extra charges
 breakfast was a bit disappointing would have preferred a help yourself system where i could choose items 
 right beside railway but noise not too bad breakfast a bit underwhelming for 4 star hotel no veggie sausages for my veggie partner cold croissants etc 
 the room is small 
 poor mini bar staff could be more trained on check in check out they didnt explain my bill 
 the bells of st paul s i can live with it though 
 walls are paper thin i listened to my neighbours tv for half the night so unpleasant and annoying 
 there was a short circuit in the room when my wife plugged in her hair dryer we had never experienced such poor facility in any other hotel before rooms are extremely small and walls were stained lift was too small would accommodate 3 people at max i would not recommend this to anyone 
 nothing
 city tax should be considered while booking because it is too high 
 the worst hotel i have stayed in the carpets were thread bare the curtains did not meet making sleep difficult there was no room service there were no coffee making facilities the corridors were partially blocked with laundry carts there were bare electric wires hanging in the corridors had the payment not been taken from my bank before my stay i would not have paid on the grounds that it was just not worth the amount i may seek legal advice over this matter 4 stars definitely not 
 personnel don t answer in dutch only english when you speak to them in dutch 
 staff are arrogant
 extras can be a little pricey so just be careful but the quality is good
 nothing
 horrible welcome day of check in 
 the hotel itself is wonderful and the staff super so difficult to be negative but the prices for food and drinks i had expected with it being a 5 star hotel to pay a little more but the charges for soft drinks and alcohol ice creams and snacks etc even around the pool were extortionate another very minor niggle only provided with 2 coffee capsules per day for the coffee machine and when we requested additional capsules we were told that there is usually a a charge for these the capsules are 29p each here in the uk kindly they waived the charges and provided us with 2 further capsules please don t let these points put you off staying at hotel arts it is a truly special hotel and we certainly hope to return 
 the room is kind of small
 room was a bit small 
 parking located at some distance they have a valet service but if you need your car during your stay it s a bit cumbersome 
 floods down stairs made the place a bit messy with mats fans etc thought the hotel was more central than it was it s the opposite side of vondelpark not the leidseplein side 
 when we were out of the hotel for dinner other people received our room the staff was absolutely inadequate in this situation even we didn t receive apologize 
 tried to charge a different higher price on check out pretty dishonest did not have room ready by 2pm check in time 
 none would stay again if given the opportunity 
 room cleanliness
 the one down side is that you can hear the garbage trucks early in the morning i am a light sleeper and would awake when they came every time my husband would sleep through this with no problems
 poor quality of the food the carpets in the rooms and the hallways are too old 
 the double bed was two singles pushed together found ourselves falling through the gap the bathroom was basically a glass cubicle can see and hear everything be aware of the mini bar it is computerised and will charge if anything is moved not comfortable for couples 
 the waitresses serve the orange juice not handy if you enjoy more than one glass full 
 no breakfast included
 air conditioning vent was too loud i didnt know how to turn it off
 the waitresses don t understand a lot of english it is sad that in the uk the waitress needs do tell you that she doesnt understand english well result she didnt know what a boiled egg is 
 although the receptionist was helpful she overcharged me for the hotel which was fine everybody makes mistakes but the hotel charged me for my own refund of using charge against me for using a debit card which i find awful 
 not enough air in the room
 location isn t the nicest especially at night and the ac wasn t working in the bedroom
 whilst using grab rail to get out of very small bath it partly came away from the wall in my hand i informed reception on saturday morning on return that evening it appeared to have been repaired however it had just been put back in place reported this again to be advised this could not be repaired over the weekend side of bath also fell off very noisy occupants with crying baby in next room not fault of hotel who had little regard for their neighbours 
 drunk brits in the lobby hot breakfast was cold rude staff security personnel slow check in generally overpriced for what it offers more 3 star than 4 star hotel
 room was a little small and although i asked for a quiet room there was a constant sound of what appeared to be an air conditioning unit this wasn t the one in my room so not sure where it was coming from 
 the breakfast service
 room was not well cleaned one day dirty cups left
 nothing
 parking expensive in street could only pay every 2 hours
 staff could be more informed on restaurants and things to do around the hotel
 we didn t have breakfast as 25 per person seemed too dear 
 we did a late checkout but the room key expired which was disappointing otherwise it was a positive experience 
 not very comfortable matters too soft
 the hotel was a little soulless but for a business hotel its fine the bedroom was a little tired and a little bit dusty 
 the staff in the reception tried to overcharge the price for the room with 200 according to the booking it was 391 including va first time was when we checked in second when we were to check out luckily i had printed the booking confirmation so they had to charge the original price i was surprised that this could happen in such a highrated hotel and also that no apologize was made 
 small room
 can not include more devices to the internet than there are people in the room the rooms are cleaned very late when people want to rest 
 i liked everything
 was supposed to be a double bed but there was a gap in the middle that was very uncomfortable breakfast was lovely but there was a lack of hot food that let it down 
 nothing
 the location is ok but is not very close to the city center
 room a bit small
 the building works
 construction site next door partly blocking the view from the terrace suppose it is a temporary thing though 
 perhaps a soup on more gentillesse front desk but here i quibble
 too many stairs to get to the living space bathroom too small almost impossible to sit on toilet without hitting your head on the door lack of hot water 
 very good
 room service was appalling in the sense of taking too long and causing anxiety as going to a concert had to chase up twice after ordering 
 nothing
 all facilities as offered when booking were not available when we stayed the restaurant was only open for breakfast no other food was available to us the television in one of our rooms did not work i reported this and nothing was done we had rooms with kitchenettes but no facilities for making a drink such as a kettle we were not given our glass of cava on arrival which would of been nice considering our celebrations 
 i would have appreciated a fitness area to work out the kinks from a long journey 
 we were charged a bit more than they originally quoted but all worth it 
 the repair that was going on in the hotel and the builders next doors
 bacon the bacon was too oily and rock hard crispy 
 long walk to tube room not cleaned till late pm and breakfast satisfactory but no more 
 the walk around to reach rambla street the hotel is not exactly at the city center 
 far from the city center not a good hotel if you want to go site seeing it takes 40 minutes in the tram to get to the city center 
 room and bed size
 reception staff could be more smiley 
 i paid for a room with balcony and got one without with the same money dont think it was fair
 nothing
 would prefer coffee maker not kettle in room
 on the second night of my stay at the hotel the alarm went off in the hotel at around midnight all guests had to leave their rooms in complete darkness as the electricity switches had tripped ran in the dark with our pj s to the foyer as we thought the hotel was burning or even worse maybe a terrorist attack waited a whole hour and a half in the cold and dark before we were told that the smoke signal went off and that had triggerred the alarm and cut off the electricity supply only one hotel staff member was on duty to assist which he was unable to do we were locked out of our rooms we only got back to our rooms at 1 30 all we were told was that they were sorry no compensation or even a written apology from the hotel management quiet scary as the guy on duty did not have the situation under control no proper disaster management protocols are put into place pathetic for 5 star wonder how and who rates you 5 star 
 fully satisfied with everything
 expensive
 smallest room ever stayed in can t have been more then 4 5sqm clean nice and modern standard but way way too small 
 nast rude female staff
 the 1st room we have which they happily change when we asked for a bigger one was very small even though the breakfast is very nice they can change some of the hot and or cold items every day 
 during the night non of us could sleep because of the tram pillows are too high and hard to sleep on 
 the wi fi connection was poor unpredictable 
 noisy use of tonnes of chemicals to clean toilets no availability of lactose free milk during breakfast
 none
 the room was too small and the linen had several pubic hairs stuck to the sheets which made feel very sick i am not sure if the sheets had been changed from the previous guest 
 having to leave the key at reception every time you leave to go out was a bit of a pain no restaurant on site meaning no room service for this kind of money and 4 stars i expected a little more while this is close to most of the major tourist attractions i found myself walking a lot back to the more happening part of town about 30 minutes away 
 only issue was the raised floor area which was black with no way of seeing the edges particularly in dark cannot see and results ed in one or toe stubbed toes 
 we were initially checked into rooms on the 6th floor they were generally nice but the windows were small and did not open as this was the top floor attic on the second day we had an unexpected plumbing issue with dust dirt coming through the shower in both rooms we later found out the issue was due to some construction work nearby the staff were very apologetic and we were upgraded into other rooms 5th floor with a better view for the rest of our stay 
 staff unresponsive unfriendly not interested about guests at arrival there was nobody there had to wait 10 minutes expensive breakfast too expensive for what you get it was difficult to cancel breakfast
 nothing to crumble about maybe small lifts but no big deal 
 cleaners slightly noisy in the morning
 everything was very good
 no good staff
 the only thing that was less than great was the shower curtain i hate it when they stick to your legs 
 breakfast could have been included 
 nothing
 was a little too far from the centre a good hour walk hotel restirant charges 5 for tap water and is quite over priced also it s very strange to have a toilet seperate from the bathroom and sink no logic
 the only thing was the hotel charge 5 50 for a bottle of water we had stayed at another hilton hotel where this was free and bottles of water replaced each day 
 room was the smallest room i have ever stayed in for the price we paid 5th floor in the attic hadn t paid for breakfast when we booked but decided to have one 24 each for a cold english breakfast 
 in the photos on the web for the type of room we chose it showed a view of the square but in fact most rooms including ours just had a back view of nothing much except the back of more rooms so check in advance if you really want a view of the square 
 the room and desk were very small not enough english speaking tv channels noisy at night
 i had to wait around 20 min for the check in because the person at the reception was so slow in the bathroom i found human hair on the walls i m surprised that this hotel is part of the lhw
 the breakfast wasn t the best but it was included in our room price so we didn t lose any money to reiterate it wasn t an awful breakfast but i think there is room for improvement there the wifi needs improvement everytime i locked my phone i needed to reconnect to the wifi when i reopened it 
 building work right next door from 7am till around 5 6 days a week no warning of this 
 hotel was full and staff could not cope room not ready on time breakfast a scrum
 shower head was attached in a restrictive way and parking was a huge issue also lack of plug sockets near bedside table 
 very patchy wifi coverage didn t spoil weekend but it did cause some annoyance
 high cost of parking
 noise from street behind would recommend a room facing the canal 
 room wasn t ready for agreement time
 the lack of parking was terrible we drove to the hotel after a show at the o2 after previously being told by a member of staff we could double park we got back to find there was no space for us and was told to use a pay and display 5 10 minutes walk this was not acceptable and at first the staff did not seem to be bothered until we put our foot down and ended up double parking behind another guest the car park must of fitted about 20 cars there we aren t from the area and did not feel safe parking anywhere insecure not good if we were disabled and after a long day walking did not fancy another long walk after leaving our car in the middle of nowhere 
 the hotel had no soundproofing at all you can hear people in the next room snoring
 the room we got did not have the view we were hopping for
 rooms are small
 very small room don t bring much luggage
 the wi fi was unusable the free computer was unusable that s a major problem for travellers i purchased a sim card to enable connectivity we were not alone in this experience you must fix this or we cannot return the sign coffee costs an additional 2 40 per cup was misleading coffee is included in the breakfast my concenious wife paid for three coffees after breakfast because she did not properly inderstand the sign otherwise the hotel was very satisfactory 
 the room was uncomfortably hot and the windows did not open
 nothing
 bathroom was a little small the shower pressure was only just trickling spoke to maintenance however no joy 
 the room was a little small but i didn t mind so much i wish it had a kettle and coffee so you could make your own drink in the morning 
 no mugs in the room instead of paper cuts to make coffee which is absurd 
 corridor on 11th floor pretty ugly and needs a good clean dirty trays sitting out all day and it doesn t look good compared to rest of the property 
 small item but the complimentary water is not replenished daily i have to buy from the nearby nisa local 
 no coffe or tea in room no room service and no posibility for making it in the room
 we had a cheeky peek at the room service one night but it was pretty expensive for what you got 
 my only criticism is a bit of inconvenience having to go downstairs to the bathroom in the middle of the night but that s because of my personal necessity 
 the swimming pool was lovely but very cold i did comment on this to the staff 
 room was very small insects were everywhere maybe due to the hot weather 
 reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful 
 view not as described on booking i e both rooms were to be a city view ended up 1 looking out at other rooms so not comfortable sitting relaxing as aware could be seen by others 2 looking out at rubbish and overlooked by multicoloured flats so had the blind down all the time as conscious could be seen 
 nothing
 we had a 2 room reservation one of the rooms was very small and requested for that room to be changed the staff went out of their way not to accomodate us on a different room first they claimed not to have a room available then that they did but had to wait hours to be changed but we had to leave the room immediately finally they wanted to charge 15 euros because the coffe machine had been used manager janine zooties stated that she did not care about me complaining because all complaints went to her she refused to give me her last name and said that it was a very difficult name i would not recommend this hotel i do travel a lot and would not return to this hotel 
 our room was across the street and then down into the basement our view from our window was bricks and a big steel vent pipe we could hear the underground trains and the noise from above was ridiculous the room was so dark the lights had to be turned on as soon as we entered the fire exit green light was broken so at night the whole room lite up green the breakfast was cold and the young lady in the restaurant was useless we constantly had to ask for items to be refilled or replenished 
 making espresso coffee cappuccino flat white etc available for breakfast instead of just ordinary filter coffee that meant we went and had breakfast elsewhere even though we had breakfast included in our rate no biggy though we are just coffee freaks 
 wifi was a bit iffy
 the wardrobe is too small there is no enough room between each clothes hangers 
 the room was very small with the bed against the wall 
 the only thing i didn t like was the very expensive price for breakfast so i ate across the street also the hallways need to be updated to match the beauty of the lobby very old furniture in lift areas on each floor 
 the hallways were a little shabby but the hotel is clearly going through refurbishment so i m sure this shall be addressed soon
 we were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple the rooms were too compact wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles
 breakfast not included and quite pricey even if i have to say it was superb amazing quality and a lot of choices and i think very few hotels include breakfast in the price of the room so it s a bit annoying but very common
 no issuse 
 the overall decor was a bit tired but certainly not offensive the bath didn t drain well 
 the only thing we didn t like was the weather 
 it was an extra 150 to get a balcony 
 decor a little tired needs upgrading bar not a hotel bar no comfort 
 room so tiny you can hardly move about no daylight very hot in room aircon not working properly and smelly view from my tiny window onto some pipes that were making noise all night toilet seat broken on arrival anna the front desk receptionist very grumpy with i cant be bothered attitude but other staff quite polite and smiling pluses 5 min walk from bayswater tube station nice location decent bathroom would not recommend to stay there 
 bar not always staffed but very staff very polite and helpful
 more casual eating options
 limited space in room info in lift confusing
 not really but found barman a bit surly
 during our stay there was a problem with the hot water system it was over a weeekend and unable to be sorted quickly so not hot water but the hotel went above and beyond to make it up to us free complimentary breakfasts both days and one nights refund 
 the rooms were tooooo small old walls old and dirty carpets and windows need absolutely reconstruction 
 very poor restaurant
 the room isn t space friendly with 25 m2 the room would have been bigger if they new how to make us of the space in the right way
 the staff at the breakfast can genuinely be a little more friendly 
 nothing
 there could have been a better explanation of the heating controls room was a bit cold 
 no complaints at all it was exceptional 
 only one slightly bad experience we got stuck in one of the lifts on our return to our room at night i was a little disappointed with the staff once we managed to get out of the lift as they were more interested in the lift than us to be honest i think they were very embarrassed at the situation and this took preference they did apologise and brought us some water but after that they just left us 
 service
 room service was rubbish and we waited over an hour breakfast was ok but not worth 18 euros per person 
 the only slight problem we had was the walls being a bit thin so we could hear our neighbors pretty loudly in the morning
 the rooms are not sound proof no a c although london hotel rooms are usually small this was the smallest very small closet no place for the suitcases no room to move bathroom is not heated 
 the location is far from down town amsterdam definitely you need taxi or tram to move 
 a bit noisy during night time due to a renovation going on across the street
 not much not to like to be honest was a fab stay 
 it will be handy to prepare daily hair conditioner 
 the construction works woke me up at 8am i phoned to reception several times and the problem was not resolved this was stressful and not what i had hoped for 
 out of choice we would have prefered a room away from the lifts however this was only a minor thing 
 how small the room was we chose a regular room but it turned out to be small
 difficult to connect to the internet in the room 
 1 design of rooms unpractical no proper cupboards for hanging up clothes shelves and narrow wardroab too high for average person to reach 2 no refrigerator available 3 standard toiletries missing 
 i am a very light sleeper and whilst the noise cancellation in the bedroom was great to the outside world the main door let in a fair bit of noise to the hallway from other people staying in the hotel this would not stop me staying here in the future though 
 no proper shower only bath tub with shower curtain very old fashion waiter in the evening had very strong body odor pasta dish was completely over cooked
 distance to tram stop quite far especially at night time and with rain 
 the service was slow they dont have air conditioner i was so upset never coming back and really didnt recommend to stay at this hotel didnt deserve 4 stars hotel 
 pillows were too thin we had a good 25 minutes walk to the closest metro 
 parking extremely expensive during the week
 room too hot could choose between noisy air con or hot night 
 this is a hotel for technically advanced guests the lighting requires real competence we managed to awake to flashing lights in the entryway on two mornings then came back late in the evening to an unmade room because a no entry signal was on despite the advanced electronics the refrigerator wasn t cold 
 the fire alarm went off at 2 30 am requiring everyone to evacuate the building they should have made a pa announcement when it was safe to go back but instead it was word of mouth from one guest to another how do you know if that is reliable information apparently a guest was smoking in their room in this non smoking facility maybe the hotel rules sheet given to each guest should state that the smoke detectors are sensitive enough to react to cigarette smoke on top of noting the 200 cleaning fee charged if guests smoke in their room 
 no closet and safe crowded dining room staff didn t give me a baggage claim tag taxi service to airport 
 the p rooms don t have real external windows they are in a courtyard which means it is quiet at least but you can t open them for fresh air and they are not transparent so you kind of feel like you are in an enclosed box 
 the breakfast could have been better not enough variety for a big hotel i found it below average
 my only minor issues were the difficulty of finding the restaurant for breakfast and the fact that the chef put the butter pat next to hot food on my breakfast plate so that the butter was inedible these are obviously first world problems and not to be taken too seriously 
 the roof terrace being let out to corporate customers and being 75 or 100 shut of to normal guest s 
 nothing
 size of the room too small size of hot tub too small for more than 1 person at the time paid wifi or swimming pool it should be included in the price of the room cold water in the swimming pool too hot water in hot tub 
 not so easy to get there by car
 big value of money for parking per day 36 
 the rooms are a bit on the smaller side 
 the room was cold radiator did not work but we did have an electric one to use 
 over promised based on how it was presented online especially when it came to the pool spa 
 stayed here for one night went to the pool at 10 am before checkout during these 30 minutes the maid came in and took some of my stuff unopened food in packages rearranged some of my things didn t clean the room looked like someone broke in so i had to check all my belongings felt very uncomfortable reception and maid denied offered compensation of 7 instead of 10 to have breakfast at their hotel which i of course refused condition of a 2 star shabby hotel not even close to 4 stars avoid the hotel that allows their personnel stealing and covers it up 
 would have liked a king bed as asked for got 2 singles pushed together would have liked to been higher up as ground floor was a bit of noise from the lift room no 6
 the breakfast staff is a bit annoying they cater to your needs a bit too much 
 nothing 
 rooms a bit small not enough shelf space in the shower sink area
 the bedroom soundproffing was really poor as we could hear the client of the next room snoring at night 
 the bed was very hard and the duve was so thin could hear the people in the next room 
 there was no wheelchair toilet in the bar or dining area 
 bed was too hard and the jacuzzi didn t use hot water
 breakfast was a little average for the luxury of the hotel eggs made to order espresso included would be the perfect touch 
 rooms were small which is probably to be expected for central paris
 waiting time before promised check in time at 15 00
 nothing
 nothing
 i found hair in the bed and shower i paid a lot of money for the room and i was expecting at least to be clean 
 nothing
 there was not reception after 08 30 hrs when i checked in receptionist gave me our code to open the door when we came back to hotel apartment at about 11 30 pm code was working for 1st 3rd door but it did not work for 2nd door middle door hence we could not enter the building and have to wait long time in the cold weather no body was there to help us i had no choice except to knock the door with the hope that some one will come out and open the door finally it exactly happened in the same way one lady came out and she opened the door by using her code then we entered in the building my family including small kids have to suffer a lot in the extreme cold weather condition we checked in at 5 00 pm and checked out at 06 00 am early in the morning 
 sauna is old and there is a bad smell i think it needs some maintenance
 it was just fine
 the bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways if the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable
 the breakfast tables were very small we like our space and with coffee and tea pots side plates and main plates it was all too cramped 
 no free wifi
 the big decorative chandelier in the lobby it us far too low 
 breakfast was not very good and they didn t gave much choice especially for cheese and ham the staff was not nice at all except maybe one young guy who was smiling to us 
 only 1 bath towel at breakfast no sausages bacon or hash browns ready had to wait for them to arrive only for coffee to go cold
 nothing
 rooms shabby and in need of a refurb
 unbelievably rude staff they also charged extra for checking in late 
 nothing
 the breakfast was a bit chaotic various food kept running out and was not always replaced eg fruit salad eggs bacon however it was a busy holiday weekend the bathroom was tiny and the bath difficult to get out of very slippery also a bit confused by the charge for the accommodation which seemed to vary from night to night when we were billed 
 unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom the hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning i was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it 
 waited a long time for staff in the restaurant
 cleanliness was a problem shofar bed linen was not clean door handle was broken hair on the pillow bathroom floor needed to be scrubbed
 the staff where very helpful and nice
 rooms are very small and note well isolated
 a bit expensive but perhaps that s just london 
 bed was not comfortable it was broken or something i extended my staying for 3 night but i still did not get the refund of insurance amount that they took in first night as i did not use any thing in mini par but no reason for not defending me the amount yet 
 the beds could have been more comfortable but it didn t cause a problem the room was very nice and spacious it was perfect for our overnight stay 
 room was very noisy not traffic noise pipes water system and overheated 
 that the hourly shuttle from and to the train station is 3 per person each way i guess it would be excellent if these charges were included but only charged for shuttle request outside those dedicated hourly journeys
 the hairdryer was located in the wardrobe and besides was broken poor and expensive breakfast
 none
 internet speed can be better
 there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but staff were happy to provide us with hot water when we requested it 
 darkness around the drinking area making it impossible to see poor room lighting 
 overall this choice of hotel was disappointing personally location was not as convenient as expected and despite king s cross being included in the hotel s name it was not that close to the station being about 10 gbp taxi fare away 
 no negatives 
 the carpet it bedroom was very
 customer service was very poor no bedding for my children had to wait at 10pm for housekeeping to come and make the bed after e mailing to ask for a fan and told one would be in room we had to make about 6 phone calls to het one no managers on to discuss situation sunday and now it appears they have overcharged me
 none
 nothing 
 the coffee in the room was not at all good there were no tissues in the room 
 no complaints 
 had to pay extra for swimming pool slightly over priced
 n a
 the cleanliness of the bathroom floor 
 all was ok
 expensive breakfast
 quite expensive in house 
 breakfast was delicious but very pricey 
 price quality the bathtub didnt work so i had to shower during 2 mornings under dirty cold and stagnant water because the water wouldnt go away i warned them the first time but they didnt solve it until last night in which i left the hotel at 4 am to take a taxi also we hired a transfer for the airport and didnt come it was 4 am fortunately the staff at that time was kind enough and called another taxi now i got a cold 
 bar hours too short at the lobby
 i was on thr top floor and the ceilings were low i am 5ft 10 getting into the shower with just a couple of inches clearance above head not comfortable 
 breakfast was a little expensive
 the air conditioning failed to work we complained and were informed that the technical person had gone home it was 18 00 and there were no other rooms it was very warm the following day the air conditioning was still not working and it was only when we insisted strongly that they agree to move our room the following day which they did when leaving i complained and we received a ten euro rebate 3 of the bill all in all a very poor response and very in austrian
 rooms are rather small still one has everything he she needs 
 room service food was not good we ordered on our first night as we arrived so late and would not do so again also the bathtub sides were very high great for a nice soak but difficult to climb in and out of for a shower 
 no price list on mini bar roof bar and pool overcrowded a bit to noisy in the bottom floor during night 
 in general is to pricey for an average hotel with average service 
 up on top floor a big hike and while i am fit and able for it it was still quite a climb 
 nothing
 the bed was too soft main entrance is closed and you have to use side entrance an outside shisha smoking area is located beside the entrance which is unpleasant room is a bit dated housekeeping want you out of room by 12noon to clean 
 low quality wifi loose shower screen cupboard door off hinges bit noisy 
 staff
 nothing
 rooms don t have radiators so are a bit cold in winter our air con unit didn t really heat up the room on high pillows weren t great looked good and the style was in keeping with the room style but they were a bit too lumpy for my liking
 breakfast cooked fresh room less bland
 breakfast less choice
 no free w fi cold bathroom no heating cold ceramic floor tiles asked for room with a view all we could see was brickwork and drains 6 feet away no breakfast included in room rate should have continental at least with these prices 
 bed could have been firmer
 breakfast was very hectic even when we tried to go earlier to avoid the crowds from the previous day service and food in the bar poor
 we booked a double and got 2 singles pushed together which is never the same also the beds were a bit hard for my taste but i know people like it that way 
 nothing
 nothing if you want a better room i e larger with a view i expect you ll need to upgrade 
 single room on small side but acceptable
 check in took over 30 mins in a thursday evening everyone was hit and tired and just wanted to get into their rooms there was provision for at least 6 check in receptionists but only 3 on duty while another sat in the vip check in doing nothing the queue grow to 15 deep similar happened when checking out as i wished to pay in cash and only one desk could accept it room wasn t offered to be cleaned until 4pm which was too late in the day 
 fridge in room bigger room
 early check in would have been preferred but it wasnt worth the extra money
 location of the hotel is a bit outside of central amsterdam we walked to the centre and that took us 20 30mins so if you don t mind either spending money on buses or walking for some time then this hotel is of quite good value 
 no smiles from the receptionists it took them time to find our luggages from the locker room no apologies whatsoever room had some damaged furniture no water minibar in the room despite the fact we had coffee machine and kettles available
 further away from centre than expected bus good bus connection very noisy room neighbours partying and screaming till early morning staff in bar did not know much even 1 was a unfunny joker not able to answer a normal question
 room breakfast area and cost in terms of the quality of the room
 very small breakfast room service was 25 for one person arrived after 45 minutes cold with cold tea and missing two items would expect better service and quality for that money 
 smallish rooms 
 the restaurant service is imperfect 
 detailing in the room like a phone missing the cable not connected not working like shower head spraying all over the bathroom limestone missing bulbs in some lamps 
 that i didn t have chance to enjoy the breakfast as it looked and smelt good as i rushed through reception each morning 
 in need of some furnishing updates eg dark and heavy swags and tails mattress for me a little too soft one piece of damaged furniture that should be removed 
 it was very noisy traffic
 our tv didn t work
 nothing
 noise from the adjacent hotel bar till 1 15 am totally marred otherwise excellent accommodation at the end of the day i stay at a hotel to sleep 
 bar staff incredibly slow very poor service we wanted another round of drinks but the first order was wrong took soooo long we gave up 
 pricing of the hotel car park was a lot i paid 62 to park for 1 night
 sound of the trains passing by bathroom was not cleaned properly furnishing a bit old and worn out 
 nothing be aware breakfast can be very busy at certain times but the hotel does have information in public areas about the busiest times and when to avoid the rush 
 there was a winter weight duvet on the bed which was a bit warm for the summer so i had to take it out of the cover and just use the cover 
 the breakfast has a limited choice but is good also 
 nothing not to like 
 some of the staff are not so polite
 small room with tiny bathroom i didn t fit under the shower and i m not even 1 90 m 
 price changed in weekend sharply
 room was very small and had a small staircase up to the bed
 the phone is not working less supply of towel
 my friends gave me a gift massage for my birthday and the hotel delivered the invoice with the cost and only later delivered the actual gift certificate that should not have happened 
 rooms look tired 
 run down property very unhelpful little attention to guest at the concierge reception more or less acceptable the resturant in the executive lounge often absent and no hospitality offered compare to destinations the services of this hilton are far below par 
 not worth the cost very small rooms 
 the tavern bar was left with a lot of finished plates on tables pilled up still with food on draught beer flat and not served in correct glasses i e stella in stella glass not a cider glass always tastes better and stays fizzy longer 
 a little expensive for the property but probably worth it for the location
 i was given a 1 bedroom flat in the ground floor with no view safety box wasn t working 
 fire drill but not the hotel fault 
 on 2 tv channels in english the shower was small
 wifi was a little hit and miss
 tiny bathroom needing upgrade
 after i opened the door of the room i had to go down the stairs it was an inconvenience to carry my bags but exercise the ceiling was high and i could see the piilars and the roof on the bed it was somewhat cold at night i thought the insulation was not good a heater and warm water in the bathtub were helpful 
 swim pool
 the bed was a little uncomfortable but it didn t ruin my stay the room service is a bit pricey so we ate out 
 no bar in the hotel and couldn t see any gym leisure facilities
 room size and wifi
 the cost of the parking underground and there is not much parking spaces in the neighborhood
 everything was good 
 thin walls could hear everything from room upstairs 
 a few parking lot
 the shower was not comfortable
 twin room too small mattress a little uncomfortable 
 check in was a joke should have had an executive room but told wouldn t be available until after 5 15 considering we had to be in wembley stadium before that obviously this was unacceptable so we had to settle for a normal room no mini bar they kindly still allowed us entrance to executive lounge fab it was empty no canap s only soft drinks we had a ball not 
 bath tab was not working properly 
 parking not suitable for mid class german cars butter at breakfast 2 months over expiry date but hotel provided new fresh butter and offered me the breakfast great reaction much appreciated
 tv is not functional
 missing bathrobes pool too cold overall too expensive
 very small room for 4 people only for sleeping 
 i arrived in the morning my room not arranged yet so i wanna keep my luggage to my friend s room who had arrived last night but was told by the counter manager that it was forbidden or they would charge me some money 
 nothing
 the sink in the shower was blocked we need to wait 1 hour between each shower because the water level was too high 
 there is not enough furniture and light in the room i hear everything from the corridor
 long queues at check in reception paid for hi speed wifi but connection kept dropping 
 toilet smelled very strongly of urine ceiling started leaking with water because of the aircon maybe mini fridge didn t work very well not good when u need a cold drink hotel charged the first night on debit card which wasn t agreed refund for this took up to a week don t let any of this put u off think we were just unlucky 
 decoration was old
 more choice for breakfast as i am a vegan 
 there is no bathrobes in the room
 the room was very hot
 it was very pricey for the room we received but the location was perfect so that definitely needs to be factored in when comparing hotel prices in one of the most expensive cities in the world 
 everything
 not very close to the city center to walk rooms are isolated from outside noises but sometimes noises from inside can be hear until 00 00 also there is no window that can be opened to the outside 
 quality of food and restaurant should be open for 24x7
 description of the location the name and location both norfolk was confusing because the name norfolk is used so often in the area not a problem once we connected with google maps 
 view of the construction site hence had the curtain closed all the time the reception could have told me about the handyphone with free wifi local and international calls are for guest to use i only found that out as i was checking out 
 i specifically requested a room with a view of the fountain and plaza espana to see the new years event from my room because of my impairment and was told my accommodation would be met i arrived and was placed on the 7th floor which would have had a great view if it weren t for the metal grates covering every window on that floor i asked for a room change and was told i could downgrade to a smaller room on the 6th floor and to await a call from reception so i could see the room first the follow up never happened so i stayed with my room out of spite as i was tired of being the unhappy complaining guest so i went to the terrace on the 8th floor for the celebration two staff members told me early in the day the doors for the terrace open at 11pm and if i came early i would be sure to have a seat due to my physical impairment when i arrive at 1040 there was at least 150 people on the terrace and hardly room to stand a manager scrambled to find one seat crammed into a corner after i hobbled downstairs to raise an another issue but no seat for my mrs it was barely a pleasant experience as i had arranged things at this hotel for the sole purpose of viewing the new year s eve celebration my requests were half heartedly met or not met at all with only a fair effort from the staff who seemed to have their decision making authority stripped from them 
 the rooms were a bit smaller than i expected
 room far too hot breakfast far too expensive and nowhere to have a drink in the evening unless you wanted to join the noisy night club
 would be nice if you could have a place to hang your towel in the bathroom while you are taking shower the refrigerator in the room doesnt work moreover at least a bottle water and disposable toothbrush provided would be helpful 
 having to wait 25 minutes for tea coffee at breakfast 
 we were told we couldn t sit at a particular table area but another member of staff said it was fine to have the window area 
 no laundry service and massage wasn t good both outside companies we lost money and missed eiffel tower tour because of bad taxi driver called by hotel he dropped us at wrong location we had no number to contact the guide our room overlooked a graveyard bit depressing 
 room was hot at night as no i dividing air conditioning to each room 
 lift wasn t working
 the bar was closed
 the wifi keep breaking every now and then and you have to log in again 
 n a
 tired and dated and i ve had better value elsewhere 
 the towels are of poor quality and the bedding sheets too which they didn t change daily 
 room temperature during winter due to centralized heating is only warm didn t sleep well at all due to this 
 really far away from centre but i suppose that s why it is cheaper than others and travelling about the city is all part of the experience too we stayed on a ground floor room and returned one evening to find two strangers were in the room who promptly jumped out when we walked in nothing was stolen i think we caught them just in time so it was more a strange experience than a frightening one paris is not the same as it was just 2 years ago because of the terror threat 
 far from the downtown but there is bus station outside the hotel 
 location was a little far from the city centre but nevertheless it is a superb place to stay who want to relax and be away from the city hustle bustle via the underground trains city centre is just 10 mins away 
 nothing 
 staff didn t spoked in english well so communication was difficult staff was not helpful 
 beds a little hatd
 a refresh of the bedrooms and windows would be an improvement 
 nothing
 the area where my room was i couldnt see the streat view all i heard was the sound of people working outside by the window across the hotel i was hoping to have a least a mini fridge 
 payment not taken until check in although unrefundable booked last year as a present wi fi not part of package
 even if the hotel is new it is not clean there is dust on the floor and specially in the corners dirty badcover with someones hair which stuck inside such basic things do not allow you to feel comfortable from the first minute in the room warm air conditioning was not working at our stay it was around 6 outside no heating in the bathroom no way to dry your clothing or even your towel just one small hanger so to sum up we stayed there just one night and could live with it but were looking forward to check out we would not recommend this hotel 
 not having a room with a view having one of the rooms that over looked the central well we found it very annoying that the curtains did not keep the light out 
 more lifts are needed
 parking wasn t great and i didn t like the breakfast much the eggs should be done 
 the bar area is too small and ended up going elsewhere for a drink
 we ordered something to eat via room service and the food was not great 
 see above 
 bed could have been better
 cleanliness 
 the room was adequate but just like any room in a city hotel not as nice as we expected rather boring really 
 can t really fault it 
 official kindness
 old gym equipment
 bit of a trek from the tube but bus route found that was a great help 
 the interior d cor of the shared areas of the hotel is a little tired and the room d cor was outdated cheap e g bathroom and tatty the biggest problem was noise coming through the paper thin walls and from the corridor too as the door had no seal around it so sound came in easily 
 poor choice at breakfast on day of leaving parking only valid to 11am hotel about 15 mins walk from wembley park underground about 8 stops to get into central london taking about 30 mins 45 min journey each way minimum and that s staying on the jubilee line 
 none
 room is rather small and oddly shaped toilet on one and sink on the other end of the room everything was ok but for the price i m sure i could have better overall facility somewhere else 
 the rooms were a very small for the price we paid 180 and the bed was not kingsize as i reserve online 
 windows was not isolating noise and air
 very expensive staff very rude and not cooperative too noise from football stadium located in the front of hotel i can not sleep elevators are very slow small and crowded
 n a
 if i had to complain then it would really only be the fact i was located on floor one adjacent to the patio area that could be slightly noisy but certainly not a complaint 
 location was horrendous booking com stated a ten minute walk to amsterdam try a 30 minute taxi ride raging never again 
 could not fault the staff or the premises went back a week later just to pop in and say hello 
 hotel stuff should use the elevator in limited scale during morning rush hour
 pool could be opened earlier and later than times posted
 we had to wait over an hour after the usual check in time there was no iron available or ironing room so instead you have to pay for an ironing service our room was okay better than what we expected after reading some terrible reviews they are basic and fairly clean but not spotless like you would hope slept on top of the covers as they were so thin and very close to the mattress which didn t look clean enough 
 the room was outside the main buildings like being in a chalet bathroom tiny but spotless lacked the atmosphere of a hotel 
 rooms are little small just enough foe 2
 phone wasn t working had to ask for room service from my phone they were very kind and call you back and shower was very weak in the morning to the point it stopped 
 poor soundproofing between floors did not lend to a good nights sleep staircase to bed very narrow in the mezzanine room 
 the lifts need sorting out
 as a guest at the hotel you shouldn t have to pay for parking also the staff who didn t speak very good english spoke too quickly also i paid a 50 deposit which i still haven t had credited to my account they took the full payment including the parking and the deposit when we checked in on checking my account when we left they took payment of the car park and hotel but the 50 had not been credited 
 drinks are too expensive
 the pool area went once and was told that the area we were sitting in es reserved plenty of empty spots but couldn t sit anywhere never went again in the six days 
 when we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste 
 pillows weren t good need more or better ones
 breakfast wasn t included 
 ladies toilets in basement absolutely filthy triple room had two king sized beds not 3 beds as expected only 2 towels 2 cups 2 glasses for 3 people we thought breakfast was included but it wasn t 
 while it was nice it just didn t have a lot of charm and character that some people look for in paris especially for the neighborhood 
 location of breakfast was bad renovation work was being carried out inside the hotel 
 asked for bathrobe didn t receive
 air condition system was out of order during our staying here and it was 37 c outside but we recieved free breakfast from hotel as a compensation our discomfort 
 they have ongoing problems with the fire alarm i noticed in other people s reviews on my first night there the alarm went off at 3am even for an alarm it is way too loud it sounded like a car alarm right in the room my ears were hurting afterwards and so couldn t go back to sleep the bathroom was very tiny and the water pressure is not good the staff were professional but cold 
 the air conditioning in my room was noisy and the bath shower design meant that the toilet floor would get flooded feedback was left to the excellent staff who pledged to look into it for the future 
 this hotel is far from the city center so you d have to take a cab or use the metro each time you want to go sightseeing if you are in barcelona for the beach only or for a conference then this is your hotel as this hotel is across the street from the beach and conference center 
 shower didn t work
 none
 dust coming out from air con vent while turning on the air con old facilities unclean sound proof no good 
 i booked a smoking room as an essential part of my stay with the intention of smoking my last box of cigarettes ever with plans of giving up for 2016 so my partner and i arranged to do it in style only to arrive at the hotel and be told they have never had smoking rooms we decided to stay anyway since we had made the trip trying to park was also an issue as the shutters did not work so i had to leave the car and walk back in to inform staff who let us in manually i believe we checked in at 10pm and checked out at 12 30 because what i had prepared myself for in terms of smoking my last box of cigarettes ever became much more stressful than i had anticipated so much so that i had to check out and we deemed it better to go home rather than stay in the hotel room 
 a bit far away from city center
 only one lift but that was soon resolved
 pillows were very poor 
 extremely small room 
 if you are on a budget this is not the hotel for you 
 none
 like most london hotels the room is tiny smaller than the photos suggest 
 initially given a very tired room on the 9th floor with peeling paper holes in the walls and unsightly cables trailing down the wall from the tv distinct lack of interest or understanding when i asked for a better room and told to meet someone on the 12th floor this is all we can give you was the hardly apologetic offer apparently the hotel is having a complete refurb which should be noted when you book small bed in this room the lights tripped when plugging in a verified phone charger and had to wait for this to be fixed drilling and hammering from 0800 the following morning which is the refurb happening the heights bar known for its views was actually closed by 1050pm on the night i stayed there so no chance of a night cap either after the theatre very surprising for a supposedly full hotel in central london 
 no usb charger ports next to the bed i had to charge my phone in the back of a imac which is on the otherside of the room there is also no bath which for 319 00 was disappointing
 rooms small and terrace upgrade disappointing don t bother with eiffel tower views
 whilst there was a good connection to wi fi the hotel s local packets did not always allow for a stable connection or made it very slow my partner is an it technician and checked the specifics whilst our room was a superior it did not allow for the the placement of an open suitcase let alone 2 suitcases had to be placed on bed to open and then closed in order to find space on floor this would apply if you had only one small case as well very dark corridors with unusual array of steps could hear footsteps and all other noises from room above had a high bath could be a plus but could make it difficult for those less able to access the shower which is over the bath very little protection from water from shower spilling over to bathroom floor 
 we could have had more pillows
 our bed consisted of two twins pushed together but i didnt complain because of the atmosphere how you are treated by the staff and the fact we had a great nights sleep
 definitely not a four star standard there was no fridge in the room we needed to leave our baby food with the staff and then collect it when we needed it bathroom was ridiculously small there was no space to place items near the sink we were asked to pay for the room at our arrival before even seeing it 
 sound isolation
 the continental breakfast included in the room rate was poor 
 could not fault hotel d orsay for anything everything was excellent 
 poor wifi
 shower door broken which was never fixed for the duration of my stay despite mentioning it several times and bathroom sink smelt a bit 
 breakfast is served in a restaurant which is in the same building but is totally independant from the hotel a few dishes on the card were recurently missing the service was rather slow we recommend not to take breakfast there there are a couple of places outside where you could do it 
 no bacon with breakfast no sausages
 i d rather not go into detail 
 nothing
 internet connection could be better 
 breakfast not included
 service in brasserie was very poor had friends meeting for lunch in the hotel table service was slow and poor bar service was very poor also staff require further training my wife asked for a whiskey and mixer on two occasions and was served malt whisky instead of a blended one staff in the bar were not confident and also when trying to receive service they were two or three waitresses congregated up at the bar chatting not acceptable for a hotel of this standard this was our third visit and we were very disappointed in this aspect of the hotel 
 expected bigger size for room
 noise on 1st floor
 the reception on check out and check in was very busy staff were swamped and did their best to see to everyone as quickly as possible 
 breakfast room is tiny breakfast wasnt great next time i would book room only 
 basic bathroom with old fixtures and fittings no shampoo foam bath conditioner which other mercure 4 stars provide as standard 
 only one thing the products at the breakfast buffet where on the cheap side the juices for example were just super artificial 
 it next to a school and very noisu
 the room was very tired with very old noisy fridge and poor air conditioning 
 deeply disappointed after staying in a radison blu hotel in glasgow twice we found toe nail clippings on the bedroom floor we found a housekeeper to vacuum them up but that should not have been needed lady booking us in forgot to tell us what time breakfast was and where it was located room generally tired with very little natural day light i do wonder if the booking was made via bookiing com if we were given an inferior room
 the lack of tea coffee and sugar was very disappointing there was no choice of teas no decaffeinated option and only two small cartoons of milk each day we requested extra milk etc but this was not dealt with well we have travelled extensively and have never experienced this a small thing but this was the only issue that spoiled an otherwise enjoyable stay 
 on our last night myself my daughter and husband were bitten by something as we slept we woke up with red marks and we re sure we were bitten by animal fleas 
 i search for a hotel in st germain with parking in booking com parking and location were the 2 options i asked but when i arrived in the hotel i had to choose another holliday in with another location out of st germain because there were no parking 
 tea bags milk not replaced after use on night 1 hardly any room air foot of bed to move from one side of room to the other full length mirror adjacent to bed not enough room between mirror and bed to see ones reflection 
 no hot water in the morning due to a problem with the water supply dirty seats in the hotel room 
 our room was booked as a superior double expecting nice views over the thames but instead had a great view of an incredibly large ventilation duct also we arrived back at our hotel on the saturday evening and there was a party going on in the hotel but it actually felt as if the party was taking place in our room as it was so loud and there was no chance of sleeping until it was over at 1 00 am 
 twin room very dirty and dusty very noisy in room on 2nd floor bathroom door didnt shut suspicious stains on carpet very basic not like pictures more 2 was moved but meant i didn t even get a bed and had to sleep on sofa with no sheets or duvet only a small blanket 
 the room we had was v small for the amount we paid 135 for one night you could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes
 the breakfast was very sub par not worth 10 50 
 the room did show some wear and tear e g loose tiles on the bathroom floor 
 delay in checking in
 my wife left a tablet in room which we never recovered not sure exactly why 
 room a bit dark with inward looking window
 customer service rude staff restaurant made us wait for 1 hour before we walked out 
 tv didn t work we said to the staff but they didn t fix it
 the hotel staff were very unwelcoming upon arrival no one informed us that the hotel did not accept cash so when we went to pay with euros we got declined by the hotel staff and they wasnt appologetic in the slightest 
 the bed was just too soft for me hurt my back better window blinds are needed 
 nothing really the hotel is perfect
 the iron ironing board is often a bit ropey and they don t seem to patrol the halls in the evenings so it s not uncommon to find room service trays lining the corridors all night until housekeeping come in the morning 
 understaffed reception 
 the hold breakfast experience was poor to say the least kept running out of plates and when the plates arrived they run out of eggs bacon and sausage very poorly organised and not at all relaxing 
 we booked the king room which was the extra cost room and our view was terrible we had a view of a metal sheet with a speaker i would expect a better room for a price of 170 we complained but they couldn t do anything as we booked it through you please provide your comments
 the rooms were really tiny even by european standards so much so that if you had a regular suitcase you wouldn t be able to find floor space to open it the bathroom door was a sliding one that didn t shut completely and was paper thin so privacy was minimal cupboard space was tiny too 
 room was too small bayhroom was ok except the toilet was also too small wouldnt recommend a single room to a tall person
 rooms too small at the front desk not everyone is at the same level of help and assistance
 no negative comments 
 dark rooms looks like a 2 star 
 the view was of a building site although the room was indicated as without window so this was acceptable the d cor was tired and the hotel could really do with refurbishment 
 the bathroom
 no dedicated car park although a small discount is offered on the nearby public car park 
 my cups in the room weren t clean they did change new ones for me when i requested for it though 
 i requested to have late check out and they wanted to charge me for every 1 or 3 hours extra i have staid there many times but found them non responsive or helpful in this area kind of cold
 bathroom a bit dated and small 
 the breakfast
 breakfast needs improvement overcooked hot food
 the air conditioner in my room broke but i couldn t change rooms because they were full but i d still stay here again 
 unfortunately the room we stayed in had very noisy conditioning and windows were not possible to open so we struggled to sleep because of the heat or noise made by conditioning it was resolved next day quickly and efficiently and we were moved to the nice room with possibility to open its windows 
 bathroom was a tad small and it was unfortunate to have a fire alarm at midnight
 a little tucked away but a lovely quiet location heating wasn t working on our floor but we were offered a few acceptable solutions to resolve the problem booking com said the hotel had a restaurant but it only served breakfast there are plenty of nearby places to eat 
 there was nothing that we didn t like
 unlike other hotels in the road this hotel is quite discreet so remember the address number when looking for it 
 service not attentive and never got any response from emails sent to concierge the heating in the rooms was either like a furnace or a fridge
 location not far from the city center not far from sagrada familia not far from but nothing interesting really close to the hotel
 the hotel requires some renovation especially lift section but the value of stay is very adequate to his present considion etc 
 when checking in at the hotel we were told that we needed to either pay 100 pay deposit by debit card refundable or leave credit card details for a deposit we were not aware of this luckily we were able to afford this however some people may not 
 nothing although it is is quite pricey but this is london 
 bed was great pillows no so great 
 tv screen a bit small
 nothing
 we reserved a classic room and the only issue was the size of the bathroom very small so two people in there at the same time was difficult this on its own would not prevent us staying again as everything else was so good 
 the heating system in the room was setup to 21 celsius in april a bit cold without any possibility of increasing the temperature from the user 
 it was a little difficult to find using google maps as the signal got confused but the locals were friendly enough to help
 while the breakfast buffet had lots of choices the hot food was cold lukewarm
 the eggs were often cold on the buffet but this was remedied by ordering an omelette 
 we arrived by car and the entrance comes very sudden in a roundabout with not a particular good sign go straight in the roundabout it s then down a steep hill until you are at the entrance it doesn t realy look like a hotel entrance if you miss the exit it s quite a long way to drive back and get it right the parking attendent was also very rude and kept insisting about a reservasion while the reseptionist had told us that we should just tell him we were guests at the hotel 
 i think the breakfast was too expensive for a family stay 
 the only thing that was not excellent was the hotel breakfast we had to send it back as the first time it arrived it was cold however the staff were happy to return it to the kitchen and bring it back hot they were very apologetic i did think it was quite expensive at 21 50 though 
 i stayed for two nights and although i ate breakfast relatively early most of the cooked items were cold on the first morning the second morning i was served cold tea and had to ask for a fresh cup 
 could improve on the breakfast 
 given a poor quality room that was not the one we booked and overcharged several maintenance issues with room several service mistakes by hotel and restaurant staff
 no think
 rooms were cold and bad smell coming from sewers awoke one morning to find food had come up plug hole off shower stains also on side off matress 
 wasn t sure if drinks etc left in the room were complimentary which was a same if it was as we did not use these a sign explaining this would have been helpful need to change the curtains as well these did not meet in the middle or cover the sides so there was a lot of sunlight first thing 
 bedroom not ready till about 3pm 
 breakfast was a bit of a hassle as they wanted us to eat in a side room as a guest of the hotel but we wanted to eat in the glass enclosed room we had to ask many times 
 there was a problem turning off the lights of my room i had to remove the card 
 no breakfast at all only possible for extra payment at next hotel 
 location of hotel disappointed that there were improvements going on in the hotel no on site facilities for meals 
 the location was very central which was excellent and as a result a bit noisy at times however this did not spoil our enjoyment in any way 
 i wasnt staying in the hotel building they sent me to a house next to the hotel which was strange 
 bathroom opens up to sleepingroom above sound of ventilation from the bathroom next to your head all night 
 the check in took a long time and everything we needed from the reception area took a long time
 single room slightly bigger than harry potter s birthplace under the stairs and a lovely view of a scaffolding erection outside the bedroom window 
 i didn t like the fact that the shower was like broken although it could be used the internet connection was not the best one i ve ever seen 
 the staff very rude and unwelcoming no wifi they just promise things that don t exist and there is no one to talk to we were told that it is our problem they just write everywere around the hotel how important the customers are for them wich is very far from reality never received such a terrible treatment the only good thing was the location but it is definitely not worth it
 nothing much except perhaps a smoking lounge for people occasionally enjoying a cigarette after dinner 
 only 2 normal tea bags plus 2 green tea not enough for us even for one night 15 for breakfast was too expensive for us as we were going out for lunch there are plenty of places nearby to get coffee and a croissant 
 the warm food for breakfast was not warm enough egg and bacon was cold 
 the check in staff was rude
 dated interior took ages to get hot water the room heater was playing up so struggled to heat the room
 they could improve the hair dryer but this is a minor issue we loved it 
 arrogant people and with focus at check in
 nothing 
 i suffered stomach cramping all night due to the food i had at the restaurant
 breakfast too expensive at 20eu seperate toilet in room 20 too small like an aircraft size 
 couldn t work out how to turn on the heating plus bathroom was cold 
 nothing
 room was too hot bed creaked so much that it made a good nights sleep impossible and cleaner decided to use my hairbrush and goodness knows what else staff were unhelpful and simply stated that the cleaners were contracted via an agency and therefore they weren t responsible for them i won t be going back 
 hard to find skylink
 was nearly hit in the room by parts of the ceiling please be aware if you stay with children as these parts are heavy 
 small room
 room small
 gym was very basic and they had no magners at the bar 
 the cleaner opening the door without knocking
 nothing
 the only thing i didn t like was the spare pillows were stained no pillow cases and the shower dripped for several hours after use but these are tiny points on an otherwise really lovely hotel
 bathroom was good but the shower was in the bath and the screen was badly placed and impossible to stop water running on to the floor
 breakfast
 facade of the building noisy street old bathroom 
 dark room and decor was awful and small nothing plush about it at all for the price squeeky bed banging doors in narrow corridor could hear other conversations through walls 
 pillows were hard 
 the gym next door while great closes early
 breakfast was ok but not too impressive found it a bit loud in the room
 no coffee
 heating in bathroom
 the breakfasts were expensive for the variety of food on offer also you needed a voucher from the front desk to get a 2 00 discount off the full price of 11 00 we did not eat in for evening meals more cold meats and a wider selection the table arrangements meant that you were often sat very close to other people for all meals all the tables should be set out so that guests can choose where they want to sit after all we were paying 487 00 for our stay the room was supposed to be a superior room but was quite small 
 that for what you got in the room i found it very expensive the windows didn t open and it was very hot in the room even with the air con on which you couldn t tell if it was on or off 
 we did not opt for the breakfast option as we usually do but at 24 per person was a bit steep when you really do not want a full breakfast at our age and there are so many other options nearby for a coffee and croissant not a criticism 
 always something is missing in the room and it took one night to get what i wanted room services is bad i ve asked for a bottle of water i recived it with no glasses or tray or ice
 wifi wasn t working well also the staff would have been a little bit customer helpfull with the tourist attractions 
 very very small rooms bathrooms parking
 the language french 
 very expensive the transfer to airport you can find solutions cheaper for transfer 
 small bed
 the room was not kept clean when serviced there was hair not ours on the wall and in one of the towels and cups weren t replaced after use room was a bit on the small side for price 
 tapas ordered from the rooftop bar was served luke warm cold however service and drinks were spot on 
 ac too cold and when i switch off its switch on again 
 pricing
 cookies are an amazing idea however would prefer ones without nuts
 n a
 not very comfortable
 nothing all good
 service is closer to what you would expect at a backpackers friendly but not professional 
 carpet was turned up a little along the skirting board 
 customer service could have been better on arrival
 the service was really poor it was london marathon weekend and the hotel was completely unprepared for the volume of people had to wait hours to get seated at the restaurant then another hour for our food which was ice cold the whole building is in need of a revamp very expensive weekend for a terrible experience i have stayed in many hotels in my life and never gave a bad review ever before the fact that i am now just underlines how terrible the experience really was from everyone i would never recommend this hotel to anyone in fact i have already warned so many to never stay there a shame really as it is in a perfect location it does need a completely new management system really as we could see that the culture of the hotel is one where they do not care well not on the weekend we were there 
 alarm went off at 6 in the morning and then throughout the following day
 service was atrocious at the bar area very unhelpful restaurant manager 
 small point but very and i mean very loud fridge in room which kept me awake until i discovered what it was 
 disasterous location no transportaion only very far away no actual breakfast all the room fell apart the door the bathroom only cool water no hot stream unkind staff and unhelpful
 marquei junior suite e quiseram dar deluxe room
 the staff didnt help to carried my lugagge
 a little far from city center but trams are easily accessible
 the refrj locked
 water from the shower was pouring on the bathroom floor 
 i felt the bedroom and especially the bathroom were very claustrophobic the room consequently was over warm and i found it difficult to sleep 
 thin walls
 the people at the front desk and the manager were rude and not helpful they could not figure out how to send or receive a fax they had no interest in being polite or offer any travel suggestions
 10 12 mins walk to duomo city centre i think i was just lazy to make it so i had to take uber taxi a few times 
 they were out of toothbrush and toothpaste when they say intercontinental breakfast is included they didn t mention beforehand that for warm dishes like scrambled egg and bacon additional 5 pounds is charged 
 confused whether the hotel is trying to be a chic trendy hotel or whether it is trying to be a fancy b b i am a fan of hyatt hotels and would stay at a hyatt hotel almost wherever i go however i have to say i had a much better experience at the nearby dylan than andaz when we arrived there was inadequate number of staff at the front we were checked in given our room keys and off we went we explored the room ourselves not that it was that difficult the room size is small and we did not have the most basic standard room at dylan i am not in any loyalty program and i was upgraded to a junior suite during my stay there a few months back and at andaz i am a platinum level member of the hyatt loyalty program no special treatment at all i had my stay 5nights stay in 2 reservations and by mistake i booked the second half in a lower room type i was asked to pay to stay in the same room otherwise i have to move to the lower room type so much for being part of a loyalty program certainly feel so special room walls are quite thin you can hear when your neighbouring rooms are being serviced or when there is a big party taking place at a function room all the way on the ground floor 
 not so easy to find or get to by car the car park we found is somewhat away from the hotel 
 nothing 
 none
 everything was fine
 not one thing 
 my kindle reader and its cover were taken from our room during cleanup replacement will cost us 180 
 i think that the room was fairly small for 4 stars hotel not what i m used to in south africa i would be nice to have a nice and balance painting on the wall the oldl furniture i did get it 
 it was our honeymoon and we notified the hotel prior to our stay it would have been a really nice touch to have a bottle of wine or some chocolates to say congratulations but we did not have anything 
 lack of parking 
 not up to the standards of a real 4 star hotel too loud construction work right behind my wall at 8 am drilling hammering etc water supply was suspended because of construction work for several hours two tiny slow elevators one of which was out of order
 no newspaper despite my request my room was at the back of the building facing the school ground very noisy in the morning drinks at the bar overpriced 
 at times a bit too much of a hipster place the restaurant in the ground floor is always very busy and overcrowded with loads of london start up hipsters so if you arrive after 9 am it is difficult to find a quite spot 
 not able to comment
 small hotel
 too much noise from the other rooms
 did not like the brown water in the bath but they had a plumbing issue and it was fixed 
 the hallway was a little noisy but nothing that bothered me too much 
 small room 
 pool was disappointing for the kids it was only for sitting in and cooling yourself off 
 nothing 
 water only just warm enough for a shower in the morning but fine the evening before the music in the bar was awful unless you are ed sheeran s number one fan 
 breakfast was a bit of a let down especially with the choice of cereals for our son 
 was advised by staff to park outside the front of the hotel and i received a ticket 
 the bed was very uncomfortable with it being two mattresses stuck together kept falling between them and the mattresses slopped in the middle 
 room smelt poor rooms miles from reception breakfast closed at 9 bar closed at 11
 sky bar 9 was a bit hit and miss on food the order took a long time to come from the kitchens with no real explanation as to why but saying that when the food arrived it was very good 
 swimming pool changing rooms really needed updating and enlarging pool on chilly side parking rather narrow 
 the wifi is a real pain one of the worst i ever experienced complicated to log in having to re log in again and again irregular frequently cutting it s unbelievable that they don t fix it if you need wifi for work pass your way this isn t your place 
 the quality of instruction material is poor the air conditionar and windows have a lot of noise the water goes out from the bathroom the view is kind of industrial the staff aren t friendly and helpfull
 nothing it was wonderful 
 pool
 they ve charged me twice for the room they won t give me my money back 
 no coffee in the room 
 nothing
 the cooked elements at breakfast could have been a little hotter
 no coffee or tea in the room
 liked it all 
 nothing
 the location is very very busy to who ever likes it hotel crew was impatient
 being told that they had a limousine to take us to the airport and it turns out to be just a regular car 
 the rooms were not that good sound proofed 
 the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable
 the breakfast could be more fresh like coffee could be man made and not from machine fresh orange juice etc 
 the room was very hot and overlooked a very noisy pub garden so i couldn t open the window
 wifi practically inexistent stone age speed 256 kbps and worst signal strength possible no exhaust in toilets not much space in room and no sockets next to beds located atleast 15 20 mins walk from closest metro involving multiple flights of stairs suspicious stains on bed frame 
 the only thing that discouraged me is that by check out i was charged of 53 80 26 90 person for the buffet breakfast we didn t consumed we went out of the hotel early the day before for a whole day combu tour and had no time to take breakfast at the hotel but since at check in i said that we ll take breakfast on this date at the hotel they charged me even though we didn t consume it we were not informed that i should cancel it if we can t anyway it was charged to me by check out i have checked in to 5 star hotels like this before but it never happened that we were charged a breakfast we didn t consume just because we said by check in that we will take breakfast at the hotel i might choose another hotel the next time i visit amsterdam 
 parking is expencive 
 deluxe double was tiny my partner is 6ft and hanging off the bed we were next to an elevator so loud noises all night shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure tv was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly if u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable but saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us 
 the breakfast should be a bit upgraded to the same perfect level as the rest of the hotel
 window was too high and small couldn t really see the scenery the worst thing was people inside the cars of london eye could see the interior of my room clearly i paid more for my room just because it was claimed as big ben view but unfortunately it was in the far left handed side that i could see nothing 
 breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time 
 room didn t have tea coffee making facility room service didn t pickup the phone nor rang back 
 no car parking
 room was a bit dark and window looked out onto a flat roof 
 nothing will definitely stay again 
 not much not to like 
 how thin the walls were we were in room 310 it was an adjoining room and never slept all first night thanks to some inconsiderate person playing the guitar all night then again at 6am 
 confusing wifi connection
 there was one lady at the front desk who was incredibly rude to me and questioned why i would need an invoice and demanded she should not have to give me one as i was already given one at the time of check in the bathrooms all of the ones from the other people we travelled with were seemingly clean on the surface but the bathtubs and walls were covered with mildew and mould 
 i cannot think of anything that would have made it better
 bathroom very small had been upgraded from superior queen to superior executive 
 bed too hard v
 had a bit of difficulty in getting the shower to work 
 we forgot to return the room key and had to go through the hassle of returning it to the hotel the hotel staff should ask for the key during check out so that no guest forgets to return the key 
 hotel front desk stuff is horrible the breakfast stuff is great
 i was honestly happy with my tray but the checkout could have been faster with just an extra person at the counter
 faultless
 room greatly overdue for renovation pictures o web site are misleading particularly with regard to the bathroom
 the hotel bar was awful the cappacino u had was very expensive for a coffee but we where in london so expect it to be a little more expensive but when i pay nearly 7 for a coffee it would be nice for it to be hot a taste nice then we had to wait another 15 mins just to get a replacement which wasn t much better i thought the decor and furniture was tired and for the prices charged i would expect a higher never of quility either that or put the prices down and i would have had a different expectation of the place 
 moving bed 
 no iron or ironing board in the room receptionist gave me the wrong gym opening hours these are minor greivances 
 the access to the hotel is not easy with luggage arriving by metro or tram 
 had issues with my card being pre authorised money in my account being blocked incorrectly numerous times by the hotel which led to me having no money for the whole time i was in london it took over a week for this to be resolved
 would have liked jed a minibar fridge
 breakfast was expensive and not a lot of choice much better to go to one of the many cafes and pancake houses close by staff although friendly could have been more helpful there seems to be a lack of knowledge of where some of the best places to eat nearby were we ended up using the internet and booking things ourselves 
 allocated a room on the basement floor next to the kitchen not only did the room smell and very filthy hairs in the shower sticky carpets and dust the walls were not sound proof hence it felt as thou you were staying in the kitchen itself 
 there was no hairdryer in my room and i had to ask twice for one also our air conditioning stopped working in the night and it became really uncomfortable and it wasn t even that hot if this does happen to you make sure you ring reception as they can fix it from there i wish we had known this sooner 
 i found it very expensive
 the room was dirty and dusty maintenance and decor very poor paint peeling off skirting boards bathroom unclean with mould on the bathroom curtains bath itself cracked shower fixture did not hold shower head properly so stand up showering impossible bedroom curtains falling off the hooks no bath towels at checking and hand towel wet when asked reception for conditioner had none guest expected to go to reception to collect an iron and ironing board honestly this hotel was simply shocking very disappointed as nothing like the photos on the website definitely would not recommend 
 expensive compared to others of better quality shower had a temperature control problem and they did not fix it after 1st night noisy
 decor in room as shown in photos is a bit dated but room itself is very comfortable don t let that put you off 
 room extra small room amenities a bit outdated
 no bell boy no room service for your needs 
 room was very small and felt very enclosed
 no space in wardrobe to hang items as the fridge is inside the wardrobe as is the safe
 guy at breakfast was quite aloof other staff were nice though 
 everything was perfect until the first midnight there was a blackout and none of the stuff was able to make it work it was too late to change the room we stayed there sb fixed that during the day and it happened again unbelieveable exeperience i couldnt dry my hair and i was putting make up on in completely dark bathroom two days in a row as a refund we were offered crossing out minibar items from our bill that made me so angry when i started to complain we finally got 15 discount on the bill relation between price and attitude to customers is unfortunately terrible wont come back in the future 
 for the life of me i don t understand why the hotel cannot give rooms a bottle of complimentary water per day too much to ask 
 staff is extremely under trained and they are short of hands it seems it took forever to check in and i requested a connected room and the receptionist insisted that they don t have a connected room that turned out to be connected at the end also one very slow elevator that serve the whole hotel 
 no soap in the shower broken bed but even so it was a good experience
 nothing i can recall 
 very bad connection wifi very slow in check in and out very small rooms and bathrooms they just started construction work and you can hear them every day
 the only thing i was unhappy about was that the sink did not empty someone had jammed it in the plughole and i couldn t shift it i reported it to reception 
 place a little bit dated maybe but that s just a personal preference dodgy view of a lot of railway lines out the window need to get them re located 
 50 pound deposit paid on arrival incase of any breakages no bbc on tv some creaky noises overnight 
 nothing
 for myself the bed was a little hard
 n a
 i didn t see any negative part
 newly renovated room smells not good some dust in closet
 no ironing board or iron provided in he room and very difficult to obtain a bottle of water from reception on returning late one evening
 room a little smaller than expected
 recpection welcome nosiy paint
 only stayed one night and could not really fault it 
 room too small
 hair dryer didn t work neither it worked in the other room of our companions shower water got cold during my shower 
 unfortunately some work was being undertaken to upgrade the reception area of the hotel and whilst it didn t impact on our visit it meant there was a minor degree of disruption to the overall appearance of the hotel 
 there s no water exit in the bathroom the floor just flooded when we store our luggage after our check out the staff told us to move faster as she has many other things to do that s so unfriendly 
 i asked for three consecutive days for an extra pillow and was told by three different people that there were no pillows not one the pillows were terrible small the mattress was very uncomfortable the blanket was small the shower door leaked on the floor i was hungry slightly after midnight and went to the front desk to order food they could not accommodate and were nice enough to order food for me from apparently the only place open the burger and the chicken nuggets i ordered for 20 euros was the worst thing i ate the entire time in amsterdam 
 the treatment in the spa was great but tea served in a paper cup with plastic lid and not having a resting area after the treatment were the downsides of it 
 everything 
 no guide how to use the free phone in the room
 breakfast is lost if you have to leave before 7 am i had to depart earlier to florence so i lost the breakfast because the breakfast time starts at 7 am
 beds too soft
 the local metro wasn t working due to work being done but a shuttle was every 5 10 mins was a 10 min walk to the hotel from there 
 i asked for two single beds found instead a double bed with a wooden plank to separate the two matresses it looked so weird i think it should be said in advance maybe its normal for the owners they are chinese i never saw this anywhere else anyway the beds were absoultely comfortable 
 hotel restaurant
 n a
 the restaurant enoteca at hotel despite not really being full seems like staff has trouble coping with the limited number of guests present and i think service at the restaurants needs a big step up 
 not a dislike but a shuttle service from north greenwich tube station would be a good idea although the walk is short in wet weather this could be an issue with some guests
 nothing in particular
 nothing
 there were no slippers in the room and they kept saying they will find etc it does not look like a 4 star hotel 
 being placed in a room with a fan you cannot turn off nor being moved to a room with very poor lighting when i complained there was no alternative room after that so i stuck with it restaurant overpriced for what i got decor was tired and sorely in need of being redone worse prices normally at least 50 higher than what i paid at usual rate i would be outraged at poor standard 
 tiny room ac didn t work ceiling fan didn t work very hot all night 
 breakfast frozen bread and cold food told one member of staff and they only said they would let someone know saturday night was in bar for drinks lady bar manager was not very nice to other guest told them to go to bed or leave if they were not staying in hotel no way to treat guest
 not a huge selection to chose from for breakfast
 nothing 
 nothing
 couldnt fault it in any way perfect
 bathroom needs a little re furbishing around the bath area
 cost of drinks
 only thing that we found a slight problem bed was in an alcove and there was no room for bedside cabinets which we kind of missed having did not eat at hotel at all so cannot comment 
 if you want a good coffee for breakfast you should ask a waiter for this 
 there was no fridge available in the room also there was no warning on the vending machine in the room stating that once you take a drink out to have a look at the label you can not put it back the wifi had to be re set often as it didn t work very well more when asked for the use of a microwave the staff in other hotels even offered a microwave in the kitchen but a staff at concord mont was not friendly also the powerpoint for electricity was not near the bed side table 
 decoration a bit outdated we did not try breakfast based on other reviews and found many cheaper alternatives nearby 
 nothing to complain about
 nothing
 must add option to coffee in the room and not as r s
 there might be more non french channels on tv but not a big deal who s coming to paris to watch a tv the only thing we didn t like was the lack of closets there was no space to keep clothes and stuff during our stay we had to keep things in the luggage on a chair etc 
 no swimming pool
 what i didn t like was that the price of room fluctuated when booking it was not too clear so i booked 2 rooms at different prices
 spots on the carpet and the wallpaper was ripped off
 nothing
 the on demand movies need updating 
 renovations going on 
 nothing it was amazing
 there was nothing we didn t like few things could do with revamping but that s it 
 room too small
 argumentative bar staff who made an undrinkable hot chocolate 
 this review is specific for classic room which we booked the room was very small and felt cramped there was water blockage in shower and it was so small you couldn t move properly the staff was always missing from reception desk and nobody picked up our calls we didn t enjoy our stay at the hotel the only good thing about the hotel is its location but then again that can be said about other hotels in the vicinity and chances are they will be far better than this on winter terms of facilities avoid 
 the wardrobe lol
 could hear traffic from outside drafty windows the room felt a little small 
 the building site 20 yards from our room started work at 6 30 and finished at 1800 very noisey
 bathroom far to small
 it was so hot in the rooms 
 had to leave 
 we had an executive room free upgrade it was a decent size but i suspect standard rooms may have been quite small 
 sonewhere to hang a coat enough glasses cups and tea coffee for three in a room for three 
 room was not serviced during our stay we mentioned it to reception on our way out for dinner still not done on our return 2 hours later mentioned it at check out staff not interested and just said sorry about that and continued with check out process 
 room wasn t cleaned properly
 location 10 15 minute walk from the tube station
 nothing 
 none 
 only thing that hotel really doesn t have control of is a lot of street noise at night all through the night until the morning when not raining i would stay here again but ask for interior room not facing street 
 nothing
 can t think of one downside really 
 bed to close to the wall also could only get one channel on television 
 the suite was a bit cramped once the sofa bed was open and a cot set up 
 the room was a bit smelly the room was big but the bath space was small 
 we liked everything 
 the breakfast service was friendly but incredibly slow i waited almost 40 minutes for scrambled eggs 
 i would have liked to have an iron in my room 
 an open tv which allowed streaming of movies from own media devices maybe 
 having to catch an early morning train i asked for breakfast half an hour before opening time but was denied
 room size a touch small
 nothing 
 i see the hotel is very convenient to its standard
 the only thing i would say is that we had a triple room but only two sets of glasses and cups for tea and coffee were provided
 liked everything
 there was a mix up when it came to checking us in to our room so the process took over an hour it was eventually dealt with but at no point were we offered much of an apology or a drink at the bar while they sorted out the mess which was disappointing the shower door in our room didn t close properly wither but it didn t affect the quality of the stay overall 
 beds were not comfortable and even though it was a double bed they used two single bed sheets not fitted which moved around and didn t fit properly the cleaner broke a glass in my room on the sunday and just left it like that i had to call someone to come get the broken pieces as i had no broom in my room by the friday i was still stepping in shards of glass as the cleaner failed to clean properly every day since the incident and despite me asking several times to vacuum the entire room my supply of coffee and sugar sachets were never replenished some days i didn t even have any neither did i have any coffee cups the breakfast options were very limited and the same every day the coffee was good though the gym consisted of one small room with a treadmill and some weights 
 not much maybe a larger room but i am in europe and hotel rooms are small had a wonderful time great hotel 
 wifi is pretty poor
 not a good view expensive breakfast room service
 this price but that s what you pay for location
 there was nothing to dislike 
 cold and not very comfortable the windows were not well sealed cutlery plates glasses not cleaned properly
 very small room dirty ground not nice walking on it without shoes in general hotel is not very well maintained 
 english breakfast
 
 first standard room was so dark and small
 room view was of a multistorey carpark office building opposite lacking a swimming pool which you would expect of a hotel of this type we knew beforehand of course but its just surprising especially where there is a spa staff seemed a bit non plussed just got handed an envelope with key card in it no mention of where or when breakfast was or any other ancilliary info location is bit off the beaten track it seems be located in a semi gated community where cars are given prio over pedestrians for pavement space 
 not enough power sockets high threshold to bathroom bashed my toes twice bashed my elbow on shower door rail and have a substantial bruise 
 there was no air con in the rooms
 receptionist could have smiled more actially once would have been nice 
 most of the reception staff weren t that friendly rooms in the sixth floor most of them they have split bathtubs than the toilet we had to ask twice to change the room and they kept saying that we are fully booked and they didn t change it until we told them that the next guest was really noisy and we weren t able to sleep they changed the room and it was the same in regard to the bathroom rooms aren t soundproof you can hear even the housekeepers chatting early morning by the door of the room we removed everything from the mini bar but they kept filling the fridge which is not nice that they were checking the fridge though we notified them that we ve removed everything and placed them on the drawer
 there was little choice of fruits at breakfast too much noise from kids in the hall at night 
 mattress were a little bit too soft but i understand it s a subjective judgment 
 even though room described as club room no access allowed to club facility
 the room i got was in a bit of a smelly floor
 staff ignored arrival no help with bags standard double room booked received a twin room and no offer of fixing the request will never book here again and have travelers in london monthly 
 room was very cramped and there was little room to move the bed was comfortable but was only a small double 
 blankets and sheets were smelly 
 room rather small for 3
 orded room service and food was cold 
 staff forgot laundry air conditioning ineffective
 the shower wasn t so good
 soya yoghurt ordered for breakfast came served in a plastic pot 
 n a
 aircon unit had a leak 
 lift very slow and stairs are steep 
 the shower leaked the cleaner didn t remove a dirty glass from our room 
 the superior deluxe bedroom was smaller than we thought it would be for the price we paid 
 nothing
 nothing negative i loved to stay here 
 one staff member at the front desk was rude at check in but the other staff where excellent
 just a little to far from city centre had to have taxi
 it was quite pricey at 200 for one night for myself and 14 year old son
 waiting in line for breakfast with plenty of empty tables but they had not been cleared staff rushed off feet at busy time 
 unfriendly staff terrible dinner and limited options for breakfast the hotel is overpriced and the beds will kill your back we had to carry our own luggage upstairs even though there seemed to be plenty of staff in the foyer we even asked for directions to the city and were sent to ask the metro staff never going there again 
 the price of the minibar the shower and toilet were very cramped and small 
 nothing everything was great 
 nothing
 drinks in the hotel bar were far too expensive bought 2 basic drinks at over 16 00 meant that no more drinks in what was such a beautiful hotel bar no vfm
 rude staff in breakfast aera 30 minutes to get 2 fried eggs that never came absoluteley disgusting for a 5 star hotel
 first morning house keeping knocked at 8 30am and we were still asleep bit early we put the do not disturb sign out the other days a little noisy 
 n ai
 the other room was very small and dim the hotel was a bit far from the station 
 the heater did not work so it was cool in the room 
 common areas need refurbishment
 brekfaat
 the city cafes close early food should be available at all times in the hotel
 all good 
 hotel rooms in paris are in general small 
 breakfast dinner menu were too small toilet flush has to be fixed after every use 
 fridge in the room would be nice
 slowness during the check in as well as check out 
 you could not open the windows in the room me personally i feel like in a prison and the room was overheated 
 too expensive
 toilet room without ventilation neither window only method to ventilate fumes is into bedroom furniture needs serious restoration sharp edges of paint afraid to rest hand on table next to bed key system based on cylinder lock 
 the painting and the room with paint smiles wifi connection v bad no single in 5th floor thats 1st time i be in the hotel without water complentry just paid waters 
 mini fridge wasn t available 
 the single rooms were tiny there was hardly any space for luggage
 room was very small bathroom tiny staff not very helpful poor overall standard 
 the elevator is so slow incredible slow there was not a guide about how to use the telephone it was not space on the desk to sit down or use your laptop in case you have to work the room was smaller that i thought 
 too noisy and so didn t sleep well disappointed with the location so had to take taxis breakfast was disappointing and not good value for money dry and looked like it had been out all morning 
 tv was useless only five channels and a grainy picture 
 no stopper on the basin and to get hot water it splashed on your legs 
 nothing really
 it was a little noisy other guests but i always have earplugs with me
 view was awful looking straight onto other rooms at front of hotel
 whilst the breakfast was very nice a bit more variety especially as a vegetarian would be most welcome 
 expensive parking fee view to unkept garden 
 almost everything was not to my liking no idea why they have 4 stars it was more like 2 at tops
 noisy under construction i sent an email saying that i m arriving early morning to book a room he surprised me the front reception by adding 160 euros to find an availability room at 9 am hyatt will never accept the conditions of this hotel coffee shop too dirty bathrooms very noisy extractor plugs useless you name it the front reception was sorry for the construction works and he said that he will reduce the amount when we check out nothing happened ignoring any promises i paid 254 euros by night and 160euros extra anyway i will never use it again 
 even though it s close to metro station this hotel is too far from the center staff are not welcoming and helpful
 noise from builders in the am but antonio gave us a discount on the room so very satisfied 
 in the room there are some things that i didn t like bathroom some problems with water and basin windows works automatically that makes you feel uncomfortable especially we didn t like the system of payment because the hotel took money from our account and still it didn t release unless we came back home 
 the price of 240 per room is ridiculous
 very small room
 the lifts are shockingly bad when they work only saw one work out of the three
 there was nothing particular i did not like maybe narrow spaces overall
 no negatives
 no free wifi available
 ashtrays are positioned just in front of entrance and you simply can not get into facility without being smoked by people that smoke 
 incredibly strong smell of some room scent that they used
 our bathroom glass door shattered as one of my friends was taking a shower very scary staff did come quick to help and relocated us but we got moved to a room that also has a loose door mentioned this to staff and was told to simply not close the bathroom door this should have been repaired the same day 
 location away from shopping area
 nothing
 i will definitely stay here again but never with booking com i had to pay another 103 for my breakfast on top of the original 507 and then the city tax so 635 for 3 night s really way too expensive indeed
 being woken up at 1 00am by a plumber in the next room and this was a piece of planned work i would still recommend the hotel despite this minor blip 
 the bed is not stady and move if you push it a little bit 
 how the reception staff
 the coast comparing to the service i received changing what you reserved in the last minute and ask 4 more money to give u your reservation the stander level of your staff is very low because they have no athourty every thing needs immediate solution they said this what the mangment told us if you need exampl be in touch with me
 no value for money charging for internet some staff not friendly
 no restaurant although room service available to order meals 
 bit noisy cause it is just at the main street 
 room was horrible
 the room was clean comfortable and spacious if a little old fashioned for my taste but then this is a more classic hotel 
 size of room way too small for the price of the room and bathroom poor 
 the hotel charges 24euros per day for parking which is a rip off so we parked at olympic park for 8 euros for 4 days and took the metro back to the hotel the other negative would be the pillows were super flat and uncomfortable 
 the room is very small and the breakfast is the same everyday 
 there was nothing i didnt like 
 the breakfast which was expensive at 15 was cold 
 rooms could be a bit bigger 
 nothing
 smelly and dark rooms bit dated now not great value for the price
 none
 get a taxi yourself if you should need one to get to the airport we experienced that one of the staff surely an exception tried to convince the driver to ask for more so that he would get a commission than the price the driver has agreed with us 
 
 hallway noise the offer of a harbor view is misleading it s really a view of the train tracks if train noise bothers you you ll be unhappy 
 found ourselves in the hotels sky lounge very classy amazing views etc was very impressed but unfortunately the floor staff not so much returned a dish that was ordered as not what we asked for and this caused a huge scene within the restaurant between our table and waitress not very professional and embarrassing on the restaurants behalf could of been rectified in seconds with very little fuss after this we found that our table was avoided and waited 30 minutes for our bill a massive let down also found very limited menu for lunch quite disappointing really would advise going into city centre we tried the hiltons sky lounge on our second day and wow did it live up to expectations amazing food amazing view right over the canal and amazing service they even made us our own personalised cocktails and to my final point on arrival we were offered breakfast as extra 20 pp which i found pretty steep as we had paid 90 pp for a family double room so would expect to be included in price after paying over 200 in total even if just continental this also let our stay down 
 the access to the hotel
 would have been better if price we paid had included breakfast
 i d used to have a room mini bar refilled daily in a 5 hotels that was not the same in grand marina twice for 5 day stay there were some techniical problems with the cold water in the bath including the one i was taking a shower while ingeneers fixingthe problem noone informed it was going to happen and having a birthday within the stay no sign of any congrats card from teh hotel management 9even after informingthem about the day of birthday not that i needed the card but too strange for a 5 management reputation
 bedside lighting not strong enough for reading but that s probably my age most people would not be bothered with the lighting in such a lovely bed 
 too far from the central but for the price it was fantastic the fridge make sure you check with reception about the fridge bill haha that made me feel uneasy about storing things like milk etc
 twin bedded room needs more space between beds
 nothing
 n a
 i liked every thing in hotel
 had a couple of issues with the keys which stephanie fixed we stayed 10 days and would have liked a breakfast that was more varied each day or each couple of days 
 nothing
 that i had check out early to get a flight 
 booking romantic night for a couple with breakfast should be obvious that breakfast for two is required and not just for one person apart of extra cost it was a disappointment
 single beds in twin room very narrow but comfortable breakfast prices excessive
 the room is very dark since window is very small and a bit noisy since just next to elevetor hole 7th floor 
 no catering at all no breakfast available no fridge in room 
 definitely didnt like that the reception and rooms are not related that means if you want cup of tea or you are going to the breakfast you have to go out and get well dressed
 nothing
 i wouldn t pay the money i paid to stay here again it was my partner birthday and i will not be rushing to return to this hotel due to the fact the room was tiny hardly no room to walk around for the money it was not worth it at all no value for money in any sense the staff were friendly but always pre occupied too busy to help 
 the towels were old floor mat was almost see through bed sheets were dirty toiletries were always missing service was inconsistent 
 nothing
 a very minor issue i couldn t get the coffee maker in my room to work 
 nothing
 the price
 nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada nada ndndndndndndnndndndndndndbdbdbdbdndndndhdhdhdhdhdhhdhdndndndndndnbdndndndndndndndhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhd
 overpriced for location breakfast and room facilities 3 star not 4 star
 it took 20 minutes to check in in the middle of the night don t know why this had to take so long hairs in the bed unflushed toilet no coffee bottle of water in the room 
 wifi wasn t very powerful 
 the rooms our old and dated with stained carpeting there was only one hook to hang our wet towels after a shower concierge booked a trip to stone henge for us and the bus ended up dumping us off on the other side of the city where we had to pay 25 euro to get back to our hotel i complained to the concierge and they said someone would contact me it has been almost a month and no one has 
 bathroom facilities shower in some of the rooms water runs onto the floors made it slippery 
 the pillows were not comfortable an air con was not working
 staff service at breakfast
 my room was so small i had to climb over the bed to close the blind so that i couldn t see the man sat on his bed at the opposite window not value for money 
 breakfast was fair same items everyday and european fair
 big key not comfortable 
 the single room was too small i had a big suit case with me and i had absolutely no space to walk 
 i use the hotel 3 to 8 times a year but the cost if i need to book a couple of weeks before instead of a month or more before is not value for money
 on the exterior of our room 206 was the constant noise of a fan husband being an acoustic consultant tried to find source ended up sleeping with ear plugs in 
 the rooms are very small breakfast is served in the hotel entrance
 the light in the bathroom literally burst when we first got there and there were tiny pieces of glass everywhere the night shift front desk man said that that could happen though he apologized he downplayed it greatly he did come to vacuum the bathroom but there were even tiny chards of glass on carpet in bedroom i was disappointed that the day manager did not mention it we loved the decoration of the room but found it really needed more attention the carpets were not well enough vacuumed and when picking up glass i picked up a lot of dust and dirt furniture also very in need of cleaning and vacuuming we love old hotels with character this one just needs a little more tlc in rooms 
 nothing
 smoky bar
 very small room
 no sign outside the hotel so drove past it three times lifts very small
 there was no kettle in the room
 very basic hotel berakfast not included 11 euro for breakfast wash hand basin in room not bathroom looking onto appartments so no view at all 
 no free complementary snacks in the room
 there is no electric hot water and we need to put a deposit for that kind of thing normally it is already set in the hotel there is no amenities inside the hotel 
 the reception looks a little scruffy only one lift working long waits 
 cost room very small
 there was a lot of commotion outside everyday not so sure if i was stuff next to the laundry or storage closet lack of english speaking tv channels a little pricey for what s on offer but i suppose location makes up for that 
 taxis booked at reception as were told by them that this was cheaper than black cab each taxi was 10 more than the hotel quoted when we tried to pay the driver and the black cabs back were much cheaper each time 
 very small room waited in bar area to order drinks but no one came noisy room we were near to lift which you could hear asending and descending quite clearly room noise from other guests 
 some waiters were lazy and forgeting orders
 we were there for three nights the tv was not working for even one second no matter how many times we complained they only sent someone to check but not to fix it we got a bar voucher for compensation but the guy at the bar said we could only get one drink we tried to use usb stick to watch our own movie from the tv and it works with a very loud voice really annoying it is not a four star hotel standard at all 
 room lighting too dim empty fridge tv image poor cooked breakfast warm not hot staff service not as attentive as expected 
 room though comfortable is not as large as it looks in the pictures breakfast seems a bit overpriced at euro 18 person though it offers a good variety for most people to have food they like 
 expensive but excellent breakfast
 the maid coming into our room at 8 45am when we didn t have to check out till 11am we were still in bed
 nothing
 maybe it would be possible to serve a good coffee for breakfast 
 the price
 stairs between pool and outdoor patio needs to be solidified fixed safety concern 
 room was quite small
 the bathroom was in a very bad state old damaged and not very clean 
 i had a bad night due to the leakage in the hotel ac and entire entrance of my room had water and i had to use the bucket to limit water spreading in my room over the night this was a bad experience since i couldn t sleep hotel did offer me for free lunch and dinner with including guest 
 restaurant could be better 
 only downside is that reception is poor so unable to use my phone or receive calls 
 the weather on our weekend 
 absolutely ridiculous that they bump up the price of parking on event days even for guests and you don t know which days are event days unless you check wembley stadium site i think if you are staying at the hotel you should always be charged the 10 regardless if there s an event going on or not 
 more consistent with the daily bathroom replenishment services another unfortunate part was the construction next door caused major noise in early morning 
 the hotel is a little tired at present
 advertised as full english breakfast no bacon turkey rashers was halal hotel wasn t too much of a problem but i don t like being misled i find london overpriced for more or less everything
 dinner included is a tourist trap the restaurant is awful the food quality is modest the dining room is not a proper room but a corridor the service very basic breakfast also feels plain didn t see any croissants or cutted fruits the juices are from a machine the hotel is modern and has good room decoration and furniture but the service management is bad our room had water infiltrations on the floor and smelled like moisture the maid entered the room at 8h15am on a sunday without even knocking wouldnt recomend as there must be loads of alternatives for same price on milan 
 the room i was given was in the basement and felt like a prison cell 
 nothing
 location is slighty boring the toilets are not very private at some point our airco failed us a little 
 small rooms window does not fully open room dining 
 our bedroom was the smallest we have ever stayed in we struggled to get our suitcase open to unpack it was a ground floor room but the windows were locked closed so not possible to let any fresh air into the room breakfast was just ok not a great variety of either cold or hot food not what you would expect from a hotel with a 4 star rating 
 not so much something i didn t like but something that was a little confusing is the fact that the hotel is linked to another hotel indigo hotel attached at the back and we ended up staying with them in a separate apartment a couple of doors down the apartment was on the third floor with no elevator but that was just a minor issue one of the staff was happy to carry the bags for us also the mercure website doesn t seem to list this actual hotel mercure hotel at talbot square on their website so it was very difficult to phone them directly it is easy to confuse it with another mercure hotel right closer to paddington station we stayed at the mercure indigo hotel in talbot square 
 it was a pain to get back to the hotel after our event at the o2 which isn t the hotels fault no complaints really would recommend and would definitely stay again
 no water bottle in room
 the food was not good at all
 the room was a trifle small
 bit dodgy facility wise for a 4 star hotel the room was extremely small nespresso machine had old capsule inside and they didn t refill the capsules even after couple of nights so i m guessing its only for one night bit intrusive housekeepers as we asked them for the room to be cleaned later but two of them at different times just barged in without knocking 
 would have preferred lake view but view was still pretty
 the gym is really small and the cardio equipment was either broken or functioned only partly 
 a bit run down needs a little attention 
 private pool is useless very small and like 50cm deep i would rather call it a jacuzzi without the waterjet function 
 is a little pricy
 room smelled like a sewer
 rooms were overheated at night
 our room was on the front left corner of the building and there was a rumbling noise i think it was from the metro underground from across the street but it became white noise after awhile 
 no tooth brush and tooth paste in room
 the room was far to hot we came into the room with the window wide open and fan going and it was still 25 degrees in the room this was left on all evening until we returned at 11 30 and it was still far too hot it wasn t that hot outside it was almost as if the room was being heated bought this to the attention of the staff in the morning who didn t seem that interested tiny room our bags took up entire floor space 
 the location is ok it s fairly easy to walk to main attractions but there isn t much to do explore around the hotel neighbourhood
 small room very cold bathroom bed was uncomfortable noisy the rates are overpriced and don t really match the quality of the hotel 
 difficulty carrying luggage upstairs more appropriate for fit young adults 
 the rooftop bar was closed the day we wanted to have a drink but the view looked amazing 
 the hebeing outdated 
 in all mornings we had to stay in line for breakfast 
 rate advertised was 99 euro yet we were charged 120 for one of the nights
 nothing we usually stay here when in london and it never seems to vary we only stayed on night this time but will return 
 television connection v poor
 decor a little tired
 there is no drinking water in bed room totally not expected from a brand like holiday inn coffee and tea maker in room but no water 
 problems with tv had to call reception 3 4 times to resolve and restart tv only one out of two lifts working so constantly havinng to wait ages for it to come and hope there was space to get on breakfast time there was no one at the front desk to seat you and had to wait ages for certain items to be replaced checkout was far to long not enough staff to manage checkout there was a long line and checkout should be much more simple 
 was at the back of hotel the blind on our window was thick with dust 
 needs a serious referb very old and tired room
 parking is an issue 
 nothing negative absolutely everything was what we wanted
 the room was very small and was dated in the decor not worth the high price tag 
 the bed was terrible old and you almost drowned in the soft madress
 as you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of paris it is not far to get into town once you reach porte de la chapelle metro station but it is a decent 10 minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed let s just say i wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless i am in a group of 5 guys there are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around porte de la chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there gym needs to have some weights and a bench aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups i suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay 
 only one toaster at breakfast not good considering the amount of guests free wifi weak at times no baths just showers 
 would have liked a bath but just a nicety not essential 
 lack of a proper bar 
 there is no system for the shuttle bus which results in long waits when people appear out of nowhere and disregard if you were waiting not directly an issue for the hotel but some sort of ticket system would help this particularly for large groups who are holidaying together a payment card does not hold your room they pre authorise it before hand we had 7 rooms so my card took a battering and i have still not had funds returned to my account this was not made clear and the staff were not prepared to listen to this and were not helpful this was after showing them the booking conditions reception could also use some training on serving people in order as more than 3 people were seen to after we had been stood politely waiting 
 standard rooms are too small for 2 adults with 2 suitcases with no space to store anything so we had to upgrade to a larger room no minibar no hair body care products staff was quite short and not very friendly except the doorman no gluten free products for breakfast
 no tea or coffee in room as complementary 11 30 checkout time is not justified
 no refrigerator in the room and double bed was queen size the rooms at tim hotel blanche included nespresso but this one doesn t 
 nothing 
 the so called room upgrade for my girlfriends 21st seemed useless the room was a lot smaller than when i attended a year beforehand and i even paid more this time also as pathetic as it sounds we weren t offered anything extra and weren t even given a cookie upon arrival like everyone else 
 nothing
 there was nothing we didn t like 
 no coffee tea making facilities in the room no charging ports for phones tablets etc poor lighting in the bathroom a universal problem 
 if they had sent me a copy of my invoice as they had promised too 
 only one mirror in the room which was in the bathroom girlfriend found iit difficult to straighten her hair romm 114 overall very nice place to stay with friendly staff
 although good the hotel could hardly be classified as a 5 stars hotel 4 at best the restaurant is good but its working hours are quite bizarre 
 the room was too warm but okay once the ac kicked in it could be noisy as the room we had was close to two others 
 reception n slippers
 the only problem was that the heat didnt work well in our bedroom but they tried to fix it 
 nothing
 very small rooms
 not enough clothes hangers
 reception needs to be more organized paperwork takes time the power went out when i connected their iron i had to contact the reception to send a technician to get the power back 
 none 
 too many annoying things in the hotel 1 you can expect the room service guy at your bed at any time as they don t knock the door the door has no lock system to lock the door so for any reason if you forgot to put the don t disturb sign you will find him inside 2 you can t shut off the tv if you have msg from the reception until you read it expect the tv to turn on by itself at night 
 appalling breakfast menu
 each year my wife and i have an annual trip to london for a show and site seeing in the past we have stopped at the trafalgar sq thistle and ramada edwardian this year we decided to stay at the strand palace which was a big mistake even though we paid significantly more than our previous trips our room was tiny and had no air conditioning there were hotel repairs going on by our window which required leaving lights on all night as we could not sleep we complained and were moved to another room at 11pm this room was even smaller we will not be returning
 room very small with narrow window
 rooms are expensive and the view from our room was poor looking out on the street and very over looked 
 cleaning very bad
 lobby was under renovation
 couldn t really fault it
 non engaging staff bland business hotel
 rooms
 room could have been bigger and we do like drink making facilities in the room
 room very small
 jacuzzi bubbles did not seem to work 
 would be nice if it was a bit closer to the station but the walk on the docklands is extremely scenic so it was fine really 
 the staff never smile it didn t make me comfortable at all the bathrooms were very cold had 2 ask the staff to bring me heating system electricity socket wasn t working
 service at reception not always with a smile
 the beds could be bigger
 for the price i paid i should not grumble but room was very small hence the comfort not being top score 
 sunday morning breakfast service was poor and the room was small with no wardrobe 
 slightly farther from activities than we thought but once we learned the tram it was easy 
 we had a room 306 may 12 14 the cleaning wasn t great 
 room cleaning was below expected standard 
 the rooms are quite small the hotel does not have air conditioning in the rooms early in the morning is great noise around the hotel garbage trucks supply cars builders etc 
 the lighting in the room wasnt great so it was dark in certain parts and hard to see outside my window was what i assume was an air conditioning box or fan of some kind which was constantly on and made the loudest noise this kept me up all night
 the area is dodgy the hotel does not fit in the neighborhood it s difficult to move around by car or bus because the roads around the hotel are jammed most of the time best way to move around the hotel is by walking or the underground which are not the types of transportation a guests of such hotel would prefer i presume 
 no lift and i had my foot in a cast which meant they had to switch my room very quickly from 3rd floor to ground floor but the staff were very good the room was a bit small for 2 people 
 i booked the hotel as a double room for my partner and i on what was supposed to be our engagement weekend when we arrived we were put in a twin room with two small single beds pushed together there was no attempt to tell us that we weren t in a double room when i went to the reception to inform them that we had been put in a twin room by mistake i was told by the lady at reception that they did not have any double rooms as apparently the toilet was broken in the double room which i was sceptical about when i asked politely if there was anything that could be done she rudely replied that s not my problem and then turned away from me i couldn t believe how rude she was i was stunned another couple overheard as they went past and told me that they had the exact same experience my suspicions that the hotel lied about the broken toilet were confirmed when i e mailed them and they replied with a different excuse that they had overbooked they added that they would compensate me with a free breakfast this is basically a scam where a hotel makes you pay for a double room knowing that they do not have one they have squeezed two uncomfortable single beds together in the hope that they will get away with it they do not care remotely about your comfort so please do not anticipate that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable i honestly am not a demanding customer in most cicumstances and rarely make any form of complaint but feel it necessary to warn people that even though i can accept that this hotel s rooms are small not well ventilated and a little uncomfortable but they do not provide rooms to the specificity they claim and are incredibly rude with little to no customer service there are vastly better options all around paris do not trust this hotel as more reviews become available at this relatively new hotel you will discover that this is far from a legitimate and respectable four star hotel 
 nothing
 n a
 on pourrait chauffer la piscine
 nothing
 location is not the best since you need transportation to go to fashion district and duomo area but the maserati service was a good way to compensate it 
 the room was too small
 nothing that we can think of 
 the breakfast was very bad
 staff way too casual and off hand dishes left for hours in breakfast room
 cleaner rooms better coffee friendly and enthusiastic staff 
 no bar
 no air conditioning in the rooms we had to change the rooms three times there was no air conditioning in the first room we we given on the 3rd floor was very tiny and very hot the hostess proposed to have the window located behind our bed open this did not sound like a confortable sleeping arrangement to us so we asked for a cooler room and were given a second chance the room was on ground level big but hotter than the previous one perhaps 28c on our request the host opened the window just a little bit it was impossible to open the window more because of it s position the tram lines are located on the street the room was facing and garbage bins are located under the room not confortable and very noisy all night our booking was for five nights so we requested a better room or our money back the manager offered another room kindly explained that this is the last room change and that the weather is a bit hotter than usual in amsterdam 22c is not hot in anyone s terms the third room had no aircon but a small window that we kept open during the night it was manageable but not confortable after all we came on holidays to amsterdam and we wanted a confortable room what is disappointing is the fact that back in march 2016 we enquired if the room that we have booked had an aircon and received an email confirmation on the 26 march from emma k stating yes other issues the hairdrier is attached to the wall in the bathroom and a button has to be pressed on non stop while drying the hair these style of hairdryers belong well back to the past i preffer to sit while drying my hair not to stand in a hot bathroom pressing a button the floor of the shower cabin floor is sleek and slippery no tissue paper ear buds or cotton balls are available in the bathroom in my opinion this cute hotel would be good for younger audiences and perhaps more for guests accustomed to european standards of hotel services 
 big letdown is that night club nearby somewhere sound of bass can slightly be heard some days of the week nothing insane but stil i dont blame the hotel for that of course dry outdoors toilet cabins adjacent to swimming pool are below what i would expect fromm such lovely 4 star hotel come on guys seriously p
 everything was fantastic
 nothing 
 the swimming pool was too small
 room key always can t open the door i have to go the reception everyday 
 the hotel is ok but not as cool as it looks like in the pictures 
 nothing
 the only thing we didn t like that the closet was too small really tiny for a triple room 
 room too small for two people no space for luggage
 probably one of the worst hotel i have been to i have been charged extra fees without any authorization and the receptionist is going away from his desk during the night expect to stay at the door 35minutes before to be allowed to enter without any excuses from him the poorest customer service in the world and don t expect to get a room like it s shown on the pictures everything is a big joke here shame 
 shower gel bottle in bathroom was empty 
 the parking situation sucks but it s not the hotel s fault just wish there was a more economical option for parking the car in a garage near by for the day 
 the bed wasn t that comfortable but it was okay 
 iron and ironing board are in a room behind reception rather than having a few available from housekeeping so you can iron in the room challenging when you ve been on the road for a few weeks and need to iron a few things for a conference 
 the staff did not have many answers to questions like how to use velib paris bike share also on our departure we asked the hotel to get a cab to the airport it is a fixed price the cab driver tried to over charge us by 20 euros while it was the cab that was dis honest it doesn t reflect well on the hotel 
 this was a 4 but the shower was in the bath and not good and the noise from the lift i think was the lift was annoying loud
 the bathroom was a little small but they often are in europe having said that it was very clean 
 there was nothing i didn t like
 safe didn t work when we arrived maintenance changed battery promptly but this should have been picked up prior to arrival fire alarm sounded at midnight but no one told us it was a false alarm batteries in tvs remote also need replacing very soft flimsy pillows provided room needs updating as looked very tired 
 basic accommodation clean but nothing special room was small very crowded staff converted sofa into a bed without being requested asked that they convert it back fire alarm in the middle of the night 
 bed was not the most comfortable parking is pricey at 29 euro per night 
 wanted twin beds and got doubles
 really could not fault this hotel
 room need renovation old fashioned staff were not friendly no attitude and not helpful 
 establishment looks a little tired could do with a refurb or touch up inside beds were a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on room could be a little cleanlier in house pizza restaurant was a little disappointing quality of the pizzas could be improved 
 room a bit small 
 the corridor to the room smelled like sweaty feet for the duration of our stay the room could and should have been aired before we arrived it was also a little stuffy and smelly had to leave a window open for the duration 
 i got used to grant the park plaza a straight 10 point grading until i got my first and single time where i needed something from reception staff which was 5 out of the ordinary i needed to leave 1 day before the end of my stay i requested that 3 days prior to the end dof my stay and the saga started 1 sir you have to talk to booking com we cant do anything for you 2 had you booked directly with us we may have been able to help 3 went to my app and there it said contact the property for changes your booking is in the past u cant change it the property will answer your mail within x days thats too late 4 went back to reception the next day was told that i was too late i should have told them before 5 said i told them before 6 ahhh sir you booked with booking com u should contact them 7 i showed them where the app says to contact the property 8 ahhh sir the booking com app is disfunctional still we cant do anything for you we will charge you for the night you will not be staying with us ummmm in other words we are unflexible ppl ummm not good i thought that would be easy since ive been in this hotel many times and i had the feeling they were flexible and would accomodate gladly a multi returning guest s rightful request as i thought naively sooo disapointed by this but still i gave a fair rating that does not reflect how disgruntled i am since other categories remain good not excellent any more 
 the doors to the rooms slammed shut every time somebody came or went which meant for an interrupted sleep
 lighting poor in rooms not good for reading over 20 minutes queue to book in
 upkeep and cleanliness of public areas could have been a bit better though room itself was sufficiently clean 
 ac noise which perturbated my sleep in room 804
 booked this and thought it was gonna be wow judging by photos and was hugely disappointed rooms and facilities for superior were small and basic had to pay service charge of 4 50 at the bar 
 the hotel rooms need refurbishing no hot water on one day traffic noise 
 1 no omelette no hot sausages no even porridge no hot meal at all on breakfast only pieces of toast and coffee were hot no coffee machine you have to order and wait for your coffee very poor breakfast for 15 2 we ordered double room but we needed two blankets well we got used to have separate blankets in double rooms and there always were two of them in all hotels we had stayed at before always except for this place after a long discussion with many excessive questions we finally got a simple cover and were happy until a maid suddenly removed it to the closet oh god why we didn t ever have a clue where it was until next morning we found it in the closet 3 it was just an unhappy coincidence that we could use wifi in our room only on the 1st and the last days of our staying but it was very uncomfortable they really made it better now and it works properly 4 tv needs more english channels 5 it s 3 not 4 
 very noisy location unable to sleep due to noisy sirens all night
 cleanliness could be better rooms are not being mobbed only changing sheets wifi is pathetic you have to connect every time and a lot of times we were cut off with no reason size of room is good but we can hear every single thing happening in the next room 
 breakfast a little over priced 
 there was no iron in the room and wasnt allowed to iron in your room for safety reasons as they said although there are many hotels provide you with the ironing services in your room going every time to the ironing room wasnt comfortable 
 american buffet breakfast consisted only of cold buttery scrambled eggs cold veggies cold mini frankfurt sausages boiled eggs and soft watery bacon definitely not an american breakfast i also cut my lip on a broken glass while having breakfast there was no information provided in regards to the facilities available they didn t charge my card when they were meant to whilst i was in the uk instead they wanted payment at end of stay this meant i got hit with a bad exchange rate and i got charged an exchange free by my card provider the hotel needs a renovation the furniture is old and the outside is falling apart with the greenery not being maintained the location is also in the middle of nowhere and there are no shops around 
 the bed and pillows was very soft the view from my room in the first floor
 shame that my iphone charger which i left in the room was not retained for me 
 there is a construction zone in front of the hotel cars cannot get to the front of the hotel
 the friendliness of the staffs 
 complimentary water left in the day light and not placed in the fridge food in the executive lounge was disappointing some daily variation would have been nice both at breakfast and dinner the hot food is placed in metal containers with no direct heat and inevitably the food becomes cold dirty glasses from the bar were not taken away and left in the room unwashed an apparent reluctance to top up on toilet tissue 
 breakfast options limited
 we booked a deluxe room for some extra comfort the matresse seemed old and at least of a bad quality the room was sloping and thus was the bed altogether very uncomfortable even more uncomfortable was the lack of isolation thus we frequently woke up during the night from people taking the stairs next to our room and from the upstairs neighbours kicking of their shoes seriously you can hear this and doing we don t know what 
 aircon was very loud when on and the room was boiling move sensitive lights by the bed came on every time i turned over in the night and woke me up i couldn t work out how to turn them off this kept me awake most of the first night the breakfast we had delivered to our room on the first morning was cold the second morning was better there was also a lack of cooked breakfast options full english or nothing i would have like to see eggs benedict or other variants available the room was a weird layout too with the dressing table opposite the bed and the tv around the corner i would have liked to be able to watch tv from bed 
 i still found the hotel a little on the expensive side also not a big thing but if you re going to have a bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded ipods iphones 
 the frequency of the shuttle bus provided by a hotel is low it would be appreciated if it can be increased otherwise it costs 10 15 euro to the nearest metro station 
 small pool room service
 the hotel needs to be refurbished carpets need to be changed and our room smelt really bad 
 reception looking a little tired and needs livening up colour
 the lifts were awkward to work and the staff didn t explain how to use them
 nothing we couldn t have wanted any more so glad we didn t go down the holiday inn option as the hotel became part of our overall experience 
 expensive parking 
 sink in the bedroom smelt of drains breakfast not included in price of stay 
 the room was so small like a prison cell which overlooked anunmainfained back garden the shows was dirty and the hotel decor was off poor quality the hotel smelt like stale cigarettes too
 breakfast was 21pp which is excessive 
 bar drinks are a bit expensive
 wifi 
 internet to weak unstable
 nothing
 attentiveness of staff management had to constantly repeat requests from the front desk to restaurant 
 the room are too small 
 lack of basic facilities in the suite kitchen had a microwave dishwasher and hob but no crockery cutlery utensils or cooking equipment electrics were hit and miss some plug sockets worked but others didn t plumbing similar story one tap didn t work no plugs for sinks and bath plug didn t fit wifi was very temperamental 
 i wanted to extend my stay for 2 more days and both booking and hilton staff were unable to accommodate me i wasn t even quoted a rate for last 2 nights i was disappointed about this 
 we booked a room for 4 but there were only 2 mugs for hot drinks and only enough towels for two people we asked for more towels but they never arrived
 my room was on the second floor on my first stay and on the third floor on my second stay so there was a bit of stair climbing involved especially since the dining breakfast room is in the basement however they are currently in the process of installing a lift so that problem will be rectified shortly and there are staff available to carry luggage to and from rooms the only other issue i found was that the beds were a little firmer than i prefer but after one or two nights i adjusted to them and it did not affect my sleep 
 rooms a bit small
 unfortunately breakfast wasn t that good disappointed with breakfast for the price payed
 breakfast was not good value at all could have had a complete range of products very poor for price of food
 nothing everything was marvellous for us my daughters wish list was more than answered
 the room was not clean
 this was our return booking to this hotel for 5 nights altogether on checking the receptionist s paper work we saw the management tried to trick us in giving us a smaller room than the one booked we booked signature luxury room they made a big fuss with smiles of fixing it when they were exposed then they proceeded to give us the same size small room this was unacceptable behaviour for a supposed 5 star hotel when we did not accept the room after seeing it we were finally allocated the correct room we could have been fooled if we had not stayed there before also the two persons lift was hopelessly slow and small for taking luggage to the room 
 there wasn t anything we didn t like and would stay at the hotel russell again 
 my room faced the street and you could hear the people drinking at the local bar at night 
 the air conditioner could have been a bit cooler
 no breakfast
 insonorization we could hear everything from the other room
 room was a bit tight for room and a bit dark lighting not bright enough mattress had a dip in it breakfast was cold even the 2nd one waited 25 minutes for poached eggs and chased twice but never turned up they did refund full breakfast cost 
 distance from the centre but wouldn t stop me from staying again 
 the distance from elevators was a little confusing and to long
 the double room was quite small fine for one person but would have been uncomfortable for two people with luggage as it was i had to move an easy chair to block the desk to open my carry on on the luggage stand 
 room service was a bit slow
 the staf member who checked me in did a mistake and the shift manager was very irresponsible and arrogant in dealing with the situation 
 more smiling faces at the reception area
 refurbish that was happened in the hotel cause some minor problems it is expensive for the
 room was very small felt like i was sleeping in a cupboard
 lack of hooks in the spa facilities for robes and towels cocktail selection in the bar were limited 
 too hot unable to turn heating below 19 degrees which made it very uncomfortable as the room wasn t large 
 getting charged an extra 10 when booking in booked a double room on line then get charged because i brought my husband didn t get that we also had a letter from reception asking us to settle our bill as we had reached the house limit of 150 never told there was a limit when booking in again i do not understand when they are holding a credit card didn t appreciate that and when we made our feelings clear the receptionist was uninterested and did not even apologise for any inconvenience 
 bathroom noisy room reception check in lady 
 the only thing i didn t like was the 3am call asking if i had requested a toothbrush i hadn t but rest assured that if i had the staff at the greenwich would get me one 
 to be told when we checked in that we must pay an additional 30 euro dollars for city tax my friend who stayed in the hotel just 50 m away teleport did not encounter anything of that sort the double bed in my room sinks in the middle and that does not provide good support for my back 
 nothing 
 better pillows and instructions for the coffee machine
 check in was to late even though we requested a early check in as we arrived at the hotel at 10 00am i understand the hotel was full the night before but i don t believe that no guests checked out early the next morning
 parking is always a problem especially later in the evening
 no tea facilities in room
 hotel did not have its own bar or restaurant the connected cote brassierie sevice was poor we walked out after waiting for at 15 minutes at breakfast without service we went for an evenibg nightcap only to be told they didnt have any rum or bacardi 
 breakfast is too expensive 
 the bedroom was quite small
 not the most central of locations but an easy walk to an underground train station 
 the staff were extremely rude i did not have the card that i booked the room with due to cancelling it they demanded the full amount to be paid again and they would refund the amount already paid to a no longer exisitng credit card when i explained that this was simply not possible the manager said do you want this room or not in an extremely aggressive manner i had already paid for the room and was willing to pay the damage deposit on another card but his customer service skills left a lot to be desired i would not recommend staying here simply due to the rude nature of the staff 
 parking ridiculous no help there were people parked at hotel and going to the excel taking up the spaces for paying customers had to park around corner and pay plus get up early to repay or move my car not happy wouldn t stay again
 they booked our room to someone else and asked me to stay in their sister hotel 
 the only observation that i have is the set up of the bathroom and the shower as they are open to the room and there is privacy in case kids are in the room
 the furnitures are old i think it is time to renew the things in the otel 
 all exceedingly good
 room wasn t very clean stains on wall and side of bed wanted to pay in cash but hotel had already charged my credit card 
 the cleaning staff was inconsistent and did not provide us with sufficient toiletries i e toilet paper soap so we would have to go down to the front desk to request them which was a bit of a hassle 
 the hotel needs shutting and refurbished is in a bad state we were moved rooms when the tiles fell off the wall nearly hitting my wife in the bath staff were good moved us to the mayfair suit that was in the same state as the last room 
 breakfast was not sufficient services were poor no any amenities inside the room no iron box hot water kettle a four start not having any complimentary of water tea coffee in the room certainly need to improve
 just as we booked for 2 persons but there were one towel and i asked to bring more and the light was damaged so i asked to repair it but they didnt i asked for an iron but no answer 
 the shower had some dirty spots in the silicone coner seals every time we ve been out of the room it was freezing upon return and we never got the room temperature up to 21 no minibar facilities while they asked 150 deposit and overpriced room service 10 service charge just to bring you a drink at night 
 hotel bedrooms are very dated and really small bathrooms all need a good upgrade all the decor was a bit tatty and needed revamping the temperature in the corridors and bedrooms was so hot 
 rude staff unhelpful staff broken shower tiny room for a suite 
 nothing
 lighting concept in the room was not well designed the very bright downlights above the headboard of the bed look nice in pictures but hurt the eyes first thing in the morning however they have have to be switched on if you want more than just the mirror lights in the bathroom the parking garage was rather small the ramp extremely steep and there were lots of pillars and edges so we had to be very careful maneuvring into and out of a space charging 24 50 eur per day for parking seemed a bit much even for amsterdam where parking is expensive 
 i was robbed of huge sum of cash from hotel safe
 nothing
 musty smell in room stained carpets small pieces of trash on floor kind of a dump for that price 
 i was expecting a little more from my delux room the location is outside of the centre 
 could have more food options for lunch and tea breakfasts very good l 
 damp room with a clear smell of mildew mind you my room was in the basement but otherwise it was clean very thin walls and the internet was spotty i had some uncommonly loud neighbors that broke the rules and smoked in the hallways who did not make the stay restful but i cannot blame that on the hotel 
 we booked a junior privilege suit however this was not as anticipated it was nice but did not look at all like the pictures advertised there was no balcony 
 buffet breakfast no good for 4 star category hotel at all staff needs to be courteous for sure at buffet breakfast they were trying to avoid eye contact and ignoring so we may not ask for something it was very obvious to us check inn problems but it was still manageable 
 expensive for what was on offer 
 small rooms
 the location was far from the city centre by foot i can t say i didn t like it but for my stay this made it slightly less perfect but as i say this was not a problem 
 tv rather old but worked i slept near radiator and was lovely and warm my husband on the other side was cold 
 small beds
 everything was ok
 stiff mattress felt like sleeping in japanese style 
 the cafe 
 everything
 in all honesty there is nothing we did not like the staff was attentive and thoughtful if we asked for something it was done with a smile no complaints at all 
 there was a structure near my room so that was a little noisy and uncomfortable 
 the room is a bit small not much room to movr
 can t really think of anything 
 the bed and especially the pillows were too soft but thats just my opinion 
 i booked this hotel because the wifi explicitly said they had bathtubs and i specifically requested this in my reservation when i got there they gave me a room with two beds and no bathtub without asking i had to ask for a change to a room with king size and bathtub after i moved all my stuff to a new room i realized it did have the bed but not the tub it was too late so i decided not to change it again anyway this was a big disappointment 
 nothing 
 late check in
 check in should be early 
 i didn t like having to leave 
 despite the hotel stating that wi fi was accessible in a majority of the areas of the hotel including hotel rooms we could not access wi fi satisfactorily and was either very slow or no access at all i found this quite disappointing and misleading on the hotel s behalf the wi fi seemed to work better once in the hotel reception lobby but for i m sure for most guests staying at the hotel it would be more convenient if adequate wi fi access was available from their own rooms too also the walls between rooms appeared to be quite thin as there were times that we could hear sounds walking shouting etc from other nearby guests 
 they charged me wine which a guest before has left half full in the frigde
 breakfast in the hotel is a bit over priced and not really that exceptional for 16 95 game day rates for the rooms are quite steep but i guess that is to be expected 
 everything was good
 in house directional signage could have been better 
 location as there wasn t much around 
 small room lighting wasn t great as two bulbs were out other than that very pleased 
 i like everything about the hotel i would of liked to have another mirror in the room aside from the bathroom 
 frist of all upon check in and waiting a indian man rudely step in front of me as if i was invisible and the staff member did not say anything to him i had to ask him did he not see me as had alresdy been standing waiting to get served check in 
 n a
 hotel in need of a major refurbishment and retrofit programme breakfast was the typical mass produced and anaemic options 
 nothing 
 no aircondition well sure there is a panel but does not work we averaged a 25 5c temperature in our room no minibar plastic carpets in the whole room soundproofed rooms what a laugh never been in a louder hotel room 4 star hotel try 2 at best 
 the bed was a little hard and squeeky
 shower on the small side
 cannot fault this hotel 
 drinking water is given only 1 bottle at check in counter no more given the other day 
 cleanliness and bathroom was very poor
 i refused the first room it was extremely poor in decoration and the carpets were worn and dirty i was shown three other rooms all the same so asked for a refund and left there in no way this is star rated correctly the only positive point is the staff were polite and accepted my complaint without question 
 the price is expensive if it s compensate with location only 
 queen ex room very small and not good value money
 small rooms 
 in a room next to the lift disturbed by noises from the lift shaft and by noisy guests returning after a drunken night out 
 need more twin accessible rooms had to share double bed with my disabled mother which on the plus side was huge 
 nothing bad but room service was limited to the menus of two local takeaways pizza and sushi 
 nothing 
 water pressure of shower was barely there 
 small room
 there was no kettle complimentary coffee and there was no usb port for charging except the back of tv which takes along time to charge 
 nada 
 nothing 
 the 1st room we got was 2 8 x 2 8 m in that room was a small 1 4m wide double bed with other furniture very difficult in such a small room to move with 2 persons we complaint about the size and got a bigger normal room we asked for a quiet room it was not on the quiet side of the hotel i heard other guests at the reception complaining about that breakfast is way too expensive room is way too expensive in general this hotel needs to be renovated single glazing decoration is rather old noisy rooms 
 n a
 did not change the bedsheets daily 
 breakfast
 they were painting the hallway i wish they didn t do that 
 low number of services marketing pictures instead of reality this is a 3star hotel small rooms no room service only during the evening we had to wait 40 minutes for the taxi and missed the our meeting which was aim of our visit in paris 
 requested a room with a river view wast given one phoned manager was told it was busy poor on their behalf 
 not really impressed with the position of the room with all the heating and ventilation plant outside the window felt the room was cramped for the cost 
 room too small they wanted to invoice me more than i paid on booking com eventually lady at reception called someone and then all was okay yet quite annoying such lack of organization
 internet connection below 3rd world standard it is not acceptable for an hotel of this caliber and in this location a pay alternative is available but you can not switch to it if you like paying on certain devices
 nothing 
 underground parking is a bit too pricey but i think that s normal in london we were about 10 15min late to check out from the room so we had like three different women knock on the door and hurry us up that was a bit annoying 
 nothing everything was great 
 no toilet washer spray in the room 
 nothing
 better bed bathroom faucet and shower controls need work 
 for some reason i did not find the bed very comfortable but i was the only one complaining in the room 
 nothing
 the staff and the breakfast price 15 person they didn t have extra cushion and keys unbelievable for an hotel like this 
 don t know if it was my room location but quite a lot of corridor noise during cleaning of the rooms and it went for hours 
 nothing i did not like only reason for facilities answer is because of the space constraints at that location the bed had to be hard up against a wall 
 no lock on bathroom door could have stocked up on more tea coffee and milk etc in room but they were very accommodating when we asked for more shower kept getting cold 
 nothing it was perfect
 just to leave a short review of the place during check in the lobby assistant did not get up and handled most of the conversation from her seat 3 meters away from me before finally coming to enter me into the system i took a lower floor on the staff s recommendation for better internet it was still very slow and disconnected often i paid an extra amount for a later checkout because of an afternoon meeting and in sequence the cleaning staff cleaning staff manager and hotel lobby assistant asked me to check out because they did not know despite me repeatedly telling each of them the room wasn t fit for a 3 star hotel how did this place get 4 stars in short this is not the hotel you re looking for 
 our first room had a very strong smell of smoke so we moved after first night we saw people smoking in rooms hanging out of windows breakfast too expensive the roadworks were noisey in the early morning 
 shower water comes out between the glass door and the ledge 
 nothing
 breakfast could have been cheaper or included in price balcony could have faced the sun more
 rooms appear feel somewhat tired beds are not as good as premier inn hotel quotation for fixed price taxi to the station was double that recently organised from the nearby premier inn 
 the elevators were a bit too noisy to hear from the room 
 the bed was not very comfortable and gave me a back pain rooms are a little too small and were not sound proof you can basically hear people walking and talking in the corridor 
 nothing 
 that i couldn t stay longer
 everything 
 cost of parking in the hotel car park
 air con not very efficient breakfast too expensive
 bed very comfortable but difficulties in getting in and out of bed particularly if on the window side ie no space around the bed it stretches wall to wall
 room too small little bit more than 9m scare
 very ugly building from the 1960 70s probably the ugliest in the whole area i am pretty sure that many parts of the building haven t been renovated since the hotel needs massive modernisation refurbishing the 15th floor restaurant was so sad i left it immediately beautiful views at least it took literally 15 minutes for the water to get warm in the shower what a waste of water resources taking a quick shower is not possible at this hotel where does the hot water come from the middle of the earth even then the temperature was not constant i was given a first room with very poor wifi reception i got moved to a second room which was next door to a lift shaft and it was pretty noisy london is expensive for hotels but honestly who gives stars to hotels in uk 4 stars for this place cmon
 heating only a few hours a day and sheets changed every three days plaster covering wall and ceiling not painted over no wifi on top floor
 couldn t fault anything
 nothing
 room was cold
 nothing it was great
 luxury room quite small
 it takes about 15 minutes to city center by bus 
 loved everything
 no air conditioning very bad room service food despite the food being good in vision restaurant no english movie channels
 there was a bad smell in the room may be it from the bathroom
 access is not easy and was made even more difficult from the car park as the main lifts were out of order also no food available after 2300 when many guests are returning from the theatre concerts clubs etc 
 stayed here twice before standards have declined check staff asked me to spell my surname which is that of a significant english town restaurant staff couldn t managed to serve 6 drinks completely forgot mine no apology general impression over priced poor service standards with no management leadership 
 value for money not good noisy a c food not very good definitely needs improvement 
 the noise from around and especially housekeeping inside since early morning
 
 got to the hotel and they had over booked offered me a room in an alternative location that was useless for my ongoing work trip the following day declined to stay so no idea what the hotel was like but i don t expect to book a room to find it isn t available i will stick with booking direct with hotels i know and chains in future 
 not being able to order room service at 2pm
 when we check in the staff told us that the breakfast is included but in the next day they told us we don t have breakfast included this mistake makes me very unhappy about this trip 
 i should ve realized that the location and the style of the hotel is more appropriate for middle eastern visitors it s my own fault for not having researched marble arch better 
 v v hot at night and kids found it unbearable
 continential breakfast could have a bigger variety the quality of the breakfast is good though 
 yesterday been raining need go out because hotel don t have food in room service and restaurant 
 toilet flush was a bit weak 
 room s and breakfast
 little clean in the hotel hall
 nothing
 we asked for a walk in shower and were given a disabled room everything was too low
 poor service in restaurant during breakfast
 no isolation at the windows no heating in the bathroom freezing cold the ac system was making noise in the middle of the night even when switched off definitely not a 4 stars as announced far too expensive for the provided experience
 on both evenings when returning there was vomit on the two sets of steps leading to the hotel the cleaner did not bother to clean the room at all on the second day the staff were generally unresponsive to our complaints over priced hotel 
 nothing as such
 location
 nothing
 water ran very slowly and not as hot as it should be plus the sinks took ages to drain at first i thought it was because the bath was not really cleaned efficiently when we arrived as i could see hair in the plug but then the sink also drained slowly
 the hotel did not have any helping documents in the place to tell us the numbers that should be dialed or even details of the facilities it had as the next day we were informed that room service is not available during sunday and monday which was odd when we came only 1 staff does it all 
 our hair dryer was not working in room 
 the hotel pre authorised 150 euro on my visa card more than one nights cost the day before we arrived and then charged full bill when we left and one week later i have not got the money back in my account 
 bit noisy in the car park in the morning 
 breakfast was only continental not much choice didn t use again 
 there was nothing to complain about 
 wifi performance in the evening can be poor or even very poor insufficient noise insulation among the rooms if people next door decide to be noisy you will hear it 
 the rooms are nice but not amazing value for the price 
 the hairdryer could be better service at the restaurant could be better 
 the only minor fault i can think of is that i found the lighting in our room and in the lobby reception area very dim but hey ho no big deal 
 everything a good walk away
 the room was really small the double bed is just 2 single bed pushed together not the best for couples 
 nothing
 the lift took forever to wait for it and to get from 4th floor to 1 or 0 
 would like ostmeal on the breakfast menu also to sit outside on the patio in the evening
 the sheets weren t replaced the room wasn t cleaned only ordered 
 the elevators were too few waiting for a lift too long 
 rock hard pillows but it s a hotel what else can you expect 
 the wallpaper was coming off the wall the bed linen was stained the restaurant offering evening meals was very pricey and the hotel pre authorised double the amount they were suppose to pushing me over my overdraft plus there was a lack of communication i originally paid for the room when i booked but wasn t contacted to say my payment had been declined no reason why so it was a good job i checked before travelling
 the air conditioning wasn t working the front desk sent up a portable unit but it made so much noise that we couldn t sleep with it on after the first night we said that we couldn t stay without aircon and they said that the aircon wasn t working in the entire hotel and hadn t for a week we asked to checkout and to pay for the night we stayed and that we would find alternative accommodation for the balance of our stay the general manager agreed while we were there and then reneged on the deal i ended up double paying my accommodation for the period there was also someone else s underwear in the drawer when we checked in i am a very unhappy customer 
 air conditioning did not work the window blind also would not work so the roonm was very stuffy
 poor bedroom small no comgortable chair no mirror other than the bathroom we had to kerp the curtains closed as we overlooked an apartment poor value for money
 didn t stay long enough 
 room furneture is too old
 make the room service prices a little cheaper
 elevator is very very slow 
 one of the towels wasn t clean at all which made me wonder about the overall cleanliness everything else was very good 
 having to leave 
 i experiment a problem with my credit card i lost it and when i try to extend one more night they refuse to give me the room till my personnal concierge bring me some cash i stay in lobby during 4 hours alternative solutions were available by example keep my passeport etc so if you have this problem don t be surprise to get treat like a fraud in this h tel by one sp cific manager on duty the day of my stay
 confusing staff information about our breakfast deal two different answers incorrect info about bar opening times so we only had chance for one drink actually expected my room to be a bit better for the cost of it but it was nice a complimentary birthday drink would have been a nice touch although i did receive a message which was nice 
 dated decor no bar in the hotel whatsoever
 only niggle was no tea coffee facilities in the room which is a must when staying for a few days can request kettle from reception but it s subject to availability 
 nothing 
 heating air con was quirky took ages to heat up and noisy
 nothing
 water temperature in shower would go hot and cold all the while and one morning it was scalding hot even though it was on cold 
 staff swiped my card for payment without my consent prior to my checkout dates hotel is far from city and staff misguided on the location and proximity to city to travel with luggage unsafe area post sunset 
 no mirror in the main bedroom area for females when drying their hair no magnifying mirror in the bathroom greatly require for people who wear glasses
 pillows are a bit too hard would prefer option to select softer pillows even if not feather 
 we asked reception about find a tv to watch some sport we were directed to the bar which didn t have a tv at all a little frustrating to have wasted our time on this 
 tea and coffee had to ask for milk and more coffee bathroom lock keep was defective our 4 year became locked in 
 nothing
 service in attached restaurant at breakfast was disappointing took food to wrong table who claimed half of it while remainder then sat back in kitchen going cold while they got it right brought glasses for water but forgot water brought toast but no butter total confusion what a shame 
 the shower made disturbing noises had expected a 5 star hotel to have slippers and bathrobes in the room 
 the door locks were a bit tricky and the room was a little bit on the cold side 
 they added on a service charge to the room cost never had that before 
 booked wrong date and hotel would not change the date poor service as it was a surprise for my wife for our 10th wedding anniversary 
 the room was small the bed uncomfortable the towels grey a plastic undersheet is a no go the iron and ironing board were poor and had to be requested from reception they couldn t provide a proper hairdryer 
 sinks in room not in toilet bath
 it was a very bad idea to use a sliding door for a bathroom also it s not possible to turn on the bathroom light without illuminating the rest of the room 
 for muslim people breakfast is poor there is no halal food so we ate only cheese and scrambled egg price is little bit higher
 n a 
 the sofa bed i expected a single bed with the double bed as i asked for when booking 
 restaurant very expensive for very average food 
 smell of smoke in the corridors even on non smoking floors
 cleanliness fitness room
 price bit high
 the car park is small and a bit tight to get around if it is full 
 instructions on how to use the remote for the blinds 
 the location is pretty bad take a wrong turn and you are in the middle of prostitues and drug dealers real story on sunday morn at 11 a m i would not recommend it if you have children i would expect more cleanliness from a 4xl they were charging the entire stay on arrival without saying anything first time ever some stuff are pretty rude while most of others are extremely friendly the place is very busy that might be the reason but still it s a 4xl right 
 noisy people next door to us 
 the lift elevator is in a tight space and awkward for getting the bags in 
 more choice of food in the bar but plenty of resturants close by at the westfield shopping center 
 a little remote from the city
 internet is limited to 1 0mb per connection 
 very bad wifi connection
 3pm check in
 nothing
 bar prices 
 new left to the entrance for older people or escalator in the other direction 
 unpleasant smell in the room and when opened the window auful smell from restaurant or kitchen below could hear the noises early in the morning from neighbours room and from corridor and could not sleep 
 the bed wasn t brilliant the d cor in the bathroom dated and needing a much needed decorate toilet was difficult to flush
 the continental breakfast was not nice the restaurant menu was too limited 
 room was poor the room smelt damp the bed was old and uncomfortable the bathroom was shabby tv was rubbish skipped breakfast couldn t wait to leave 
 room too small no restaurant bar not business hotel standard
 the hotel could have a pool
 price of the cocktails 
 the hotel is no more than two or three stars 
 blonde receptionist not what i d call rude but not very friendly either and it was a bit off putting considering the price of the hotel per night she looked like she couldn t wait to be going home only other staff i met were cleaners who were friendly 
 when booking online nothing was mentioned about paying 50 city tax what ever that is i m still skeptical but what can you do when you want the key to your room 
 the hotel is now very worn and old not in a good way i used to stay here a few years ago and quite liked it but problems with bookings meant i switched to other properties when in london the place feels disorganised my booking had been mixed up and i couldn t get the room i had booked i was given another room which already had other peoples luggage in it staff did not seem to understand why such things are annoying when i eventually spoke to the manager he was very good and promised to rectify things for future trips but there was no practical solution offered i did get the suite i had booked on a my second night but my 2nd evening was busy with work and i only got to use it for 6 hours before checking out for the airport all in all very disappointing 
 it was an average hilton hotel the lobby is much more impressive than the room the coffee supplied in the rooms were was very average and there were not enough toiletries 
 i felt staff could have put themselves out a bit more
 breakfast area is a bit shabby the room was not as clean as it could be the mattress was not very comfortable the room radiator did not work asked for a quiet room however it was situated close to a noisy road 
 breakfast is really poor and does not correspond to a five star hotel 
 the receptionists are not professional their english is not very good and are not welcoming one thing that i didn t liked in the room is that i don t understand at this price and with a coffee machine in the room why they don t give every day some capsules for coffee i ve had two nights accommodation and one coffee for each 2 adults it s a shame you need to look at that machine and not to have coffee to make one or maybe you need to ask for some and pay extra 
 due to the few and expensive choices at the restaurant we did not dine there 
 the bedroom was comfortable but didn t like the window overlooking the atrium bathroom was a wet room which flooded all the floor when the shower was used not ideal fittings in bathroom tired old and some broken towels old and grey only stayed 2 nights would not have liked to have stayed longer expected better from the rate which is charged 
 room a bit small overlooked by adjacent office and only means of privacy was to fully close blinds making room dark during day time 
 
 there were no kettles in the room so you would need to get some from the reception bar area downstairs 
 old tv bathroom a bit dated breakfast buffet was good but was the same everyday small exercise room and no swimming pool
 the bedroom was in general clean but when the light was switched on a couple of cobwebs were apparent on the light fitting 
 average offering for the money nothing special basic and functional
 hair dryer did not work
 room and cost
 not near to city center
 facilities are small and not inviting hotel seems ok but not worth the price lifts are prehistoric
 nothing but travellers should be aware this hotel is not in central barcelona but in hills above it 
 when i checked in the room i got was letting the light in at night and when i told the receptioninst he was unhappy i asked to change to a rooms with better curtains claming all rooms have windows so i was treated disrespectfully then the towel heater wasnt working hair dryer wasnt working took 2hourd to get a new one the service was very poor compared to the standards i usually get in 4 h tels 
 elevator could be better
 very poor value for money i booked in early june and was given a disabled room staff spoke poor english
 feel the cost of breakfast was far too expensive
 service in the bar on saturday night shocking no glasses etc
 that we couldn t stay longer 
 there was damage to the air conditioning device marks on the walls and the little extras were not there as described i will be writing a letter of complaint to the company
 the mild in the corner of our room 419
 the gym and pool was small but hey at least it had one the staff didn t speak great english but they understood enough to help you out 
 not clean bathroom was smilly 
 overall ok for a brief stay 5 7 min journey by car to central london so that was good however the view outside window was not not at all no toothpaste wasn t aware that the holding fee would be placed even though bill was payed for so had to go back to the hotel and enquire
 the bathroom could be little more modern 
 rooms too small shower poor took ages to get hot water this was deluxe so very expensive for what we got better quality in budget room hotels look elsewhere 
 the 3 rooms i got are very small not the same i have paid for the breakfast was the cheap normal stuff eggs and eggs i asked for black pepper they didn t have any the towels must be left at the floor or it will not be changed the swiming pool charging 8 pounds per person the breakfast finish at 10 am not 10 30 am
 i truly can t think of a thing 
 can t fault this hotel 
 the bed could be more comfy sweet i had was very small portion eton mess 
 construction go on on the street 
 n a
 minor thing but extra pillows in room would have been nice 
 the man who checked us in was very rude and not friendly
 overpriced services bar coffee shop garage very old facility visibly antiquated bathroom fittings uncomfortable beds
 unfortunately there wasn t a gym or spa 
 beer costs 10 euro
 nothing perfect stay 
 our room was tiny it had a small window that you could not see out off on ground floor check in too far too long waited for one couple to check in before us then our own check in seemed to take an age we were told we would have ground floor room as no others were available 
 little bit far from subway station there is a warning message that hotel is not liable for any belongings inside rooms as the breakfast time is the most appropriate time to steal yr contents from room
 how it wasnt made clear that you pay on arrival so we thought it had been paid for as it was a birthday present had to comtact home to get money transferred
 rooms very hot unable to control temperature price of breakfast 
 rooms where dark reading light which you wanted to turn on if you went to the toilet in the night on the other hand was totally blinding redesign the room lightening 
 just a bit pricey so drank and ate elsewhere good choice of restaurants in local area 
 the reception employees no hospitality at all 
 i ve stayed here a few times in the past and generally liked it however the recently renovated decor of the rooms is somewhat akin to a teenage boy s bedroom or bachelor flat and terribly dark definitely not a romantic vibe at all all a bit too urban and try hard awoke to building works right outside our window not such a great night s sleep 
 the restaurant and food was dreadful we had to send our food back twice and the third occasion they still hadnt got it correct the queues for reception were very long and no apologies for the wait 
 the lift was out of order we had to climb 5 flights with a handicapped person but they moved us monday morning to the 1st floor we left tuesday morning the restaurant managers was a bit frosty but overall it was a good trip the restaurant staff had limited english but were smart and very pleasant 
 the bar prices were a bit steep and then service charge is added
 we had only 2 nights 
 rooms and bathrooms
 no complaints from me 
 nothing not to like
 the 15 minute queue for breakfast and lack of crockery was absurd for a hotel of this standard food could have been hotter 
 the large porn selection also controlled from the ipad 
 room very small could not open wardrobe doors because of proximity to bed
 having to leave
 a staff in winter garden quite rude to us at breakfast we has been the number of time before and that is the first bad experience 
 the room was so small my husband could touch the walls on either side of the room with arms outstretched shower too small no window except for a tiny one that barely opened onto a hole with a big vent no daylight available asked for another room but were denied way overpriced for an area that was a fair distance from any attractions 
 nothing
 the double room was tiny and the free wi fi was really slow 
 pool size
 no lift
 had to come home
 cathedral view rooms obstructed by trees
 there were renovations going on very loud we were not informed prior or on arrival about the renovations we had booked and confirmed with two children but they did not know the children were coming no room service during our weekend stay only one lift working to ground floor lots of people waiting and lifts full shower floor unable to cope with water from shower therefore bathroom floor always wet 
 hotel information said charge for wifi but we were told when booking in that it was complementary this was fine but we did not take our ipad because there was no way we would pay 10 per day for wifi in a 4 star hotel 
 nothing
 breakfast at e10 80 was too expensive so i had mine at macdonalds for e3 40 
 room was on the lower ground floor with window facing onto a brick wall despite paying extra for an executive room service at breakfast was average had to repeatedly ask for tea coffee food trays were left un replenished for long periods particularly scrambled eggs prices in bar a complete rip off tried to charge 16 60 for a beer and a glass of wine when same drinks half an hour earlier were 12 49 eventually reluctantly accepted previous price 
 the pictures and the description are terribly misleading as we walked into the building we realized that hotel was located on two floors the pictures featured on booking com do not match at all the conditions we met there everything in the bedroom was falling apart the bathroom was ancient and had fungus on the wall the taps were extremely unpractical to use the hotel has no restaurant only a generous breakfast with very low quality food the manager treated his employees very bad yelling at them in front of guests which was quite embarrassing to watch it is a big surprise that this accommodation is awarded 4 stars because it doesn t have half of the things that a 4 star hotel should offer big disappointment after staying at a very nice 4 star hotel in ljubljana that is also part of best western hotels 
 bath with shower over could ve done with a good scrub grout very marked
 almost nothing
 there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room and the breakfast price seemed expensive i didn t book breakfast as a result of the cost and found local cafes do breakfast at a more reasonable price 
 the reception staff are generally discourteous and provide poor customer service there is an air of them doing you a favour when they do actually get to provide an expected service i e timely and professional reception duties the bar in the main foyer is lovely environment inadequately staffed by a person who at best could be described as miserable 
 everything was amazing
 if you are getting an extra bed or anything please keep your receipt with you so they don t ask you to pay for more or extra if you don t have a proof lights are very few in the room and the rooms are a bit dark 
 no variety in breakfast lounge food was also boring had to argue to get a late checkout even after i offered to pay
 as soon as we got to the hotel to check in the guy behind the reception desk was on the phone to somebody saying things like do we have anything else available which made us panic also when checking out i had to hand over my card again for payment even though i did this already at check in i m assured that i will not be charged twice for the room and that the first payment will be refunded back but i really don t understand why they don t just accept the first payment instead of taking it again and cancelling the first one this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and really worried now i will be charged twice for the room
 very expensive 
 no provision of an iron and ironing board in the room
 no prices for mini bar or was it free v busy just outside hotel but it is by a train and bus station so to be expected
 the kingsize bed was a bit small 
 none 
 breakfast prefer buffet style
 nothing much everything is perfect 
 the sound of the mini bar fridge otherwise the room was quiet 
 nothing to mention during my stay staff in reception desk could be more friendly the concierge guys were great though 
 liked everythin 
 the hotel has floor boards and you can hear the guest from upstairs walking however if you are never at the room then it will not bother you 
 the room smelled of damp worn and threadbare carpets bathroom mould and grout and silicone missing overall a dated tired dark miserable room 
 reception area lounge and it s positiongpod
 room too small and cramped
 hotel in need of modernisation poor sound proofing in rooms truculent staff in restaurant
 the bed and it was too hot in the room
 in business trip for 5 or more days a bigger wardrobe would be interesting 
 no natural light in room 150 however the lighting in the room was good but of a type that is not the best not in brightness but the type of lighting but the most noticeable issue was noise poor please remove the soundproofing on your list as this is not true and the racket from bottles being emptied into bins in the morning was better than any alarm clock 
 range of room service was a bit limited 
 facilities there is no pool gym etc
 nothing
 i would have liked to have had a security chain on the door
 horrible staff i paid extra for twin room get single bed room dirty toilets 
 very small bedroom bed slid around on the floor 
 nothing
 would have liked to see one person who was delegated to looking after hotel customers during the evening had to scream very loudly at a bar member to acquire extra milk for the room which was handed to me in a mug errr a little off putting when you are charging top rate prices 
 can t really answer this as i didn t find anything i didn t like 
 way too expensive taking advantage of rugby world cup paid 340 for a room and they would not even include breakfast even though my colleague was paying less for his room and it included breakfast check in staff did not seem to care
 air conditioning was broken on the hottest days of this summer and staff were not concerned about getting it fixed beds uncomfortable and pillows useless pool was ok but sauna tiny 2 people maximum no showers or adequate changing areas the photos were clearly photoshopped
 small bathroom very small lifts lengthy check in due to computer problems
 breakfast and evening meal it was very expensive and was not cooked very well also we had a double room with spare bed but the spare bed was not comfortable 
 wifi was expired at to 24 00 i cannot connect in the morning before check out 
 our flight arrived at 5 30 am our check in was at 3 00pm we were not able to check in early however as it turned out our room was not ready available at check in time and they upgraded our room don t expect to check in early 
 i had not been informed in advance that the hotel takes 100 pounds deposit per night i had to use my personal bank card instead of my business bank card and overdrew it no one even apologised to me for the inconvenience 
 the staff could smile a bit
 shower controls in the wrong place no curtains in the bedroom no chairs in the restaurant and bedroom only low cubes to sit on
 cold in the room
 there was a distinct shortage of space in the breakfast room meaning on our final morning the staff had to improvise and put 6 of us 3 non related couples in a side room i have to say that i think it is a bit over priced frankly 
 the bed is immediate next to the washing room makes a little uncomfortable 
 nothing
 bulb blown in bathroom
 nothing
 stayed at this hotel at the weekend for my partners 40th birthday i d paid for an executive room which i was quite disappointed with as seemed quite small the room had clearly been a twin as there was a piece of wood where presumably a headboard had been no soft furnishing details such as cushions or bed runner no toilet paper no bath robes no mini bar lacked that sense of luxury had not been told that as we had paid for an executive room that we were entitled to use the executive lounge i only found out about this once i d returned from colleagues at work had to pay 70 for parking in their own car park too an information welcome pack on arrival would ve been nice to have been given information about the free bar etc instead of learning of this once returned and having spent a small fortune on food and drinks would i stay again probably not 
 found ground floor room facing the street quite noisy during night and was woken early because of this request different floor or other side of building 
 very bad beds the breakfast is too much expensive
 decor is old and tired 
 no refrigerator
 request for a blanket for each twin bed was declined instead reception turned heat in the room to 25 degrees c without our permission room was excessively hot and we were deprived of badly needed sleep for our return journey to the u s 
 i actually like the sister hotel better also owned by le six a little more rustic old european which we really like modern hotels we can get anywhere 
 there was no one to help us with our bags 
 shower flooded bathroom each morning
 the staff at the bar was not really qualified we ordered a bottle of prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us 10 minutes later that we would need to pay as they are closing we got a room in the basement which is considering the price i would have liked to know prior to my stay 
 better understanding how to use key card for lifts 
 small lift
 nothing
 did not have breakfast as thought it was overpriced only one packet of biscuits in room 
 it seems more like a 3 star but very nice 
 very high tech probably due to our age but we struggled to get the tv to work and also the lights turning them off was an interesting experience providing us with an exciting light show when we were trying to switch them off 
 no parking expensive ncp down the road but that s not the hotels fault 
 had to wait for a short while for a breakfast table the room is too small 
 the fact my stay was so short
 the room itself was a bit worn down 
 it s a very different type of hotel and very high tech the room is small but we believed value for money 
 the rooms at the front were not sound proof and all the street noise could be heard from closed windows we have to change our room to be able to sleep
 location far from tourism attractions 
 basic rooms
 the location and the rates
 the rooms are way too small especially the single ones 
 we were separate from the main hotel
 my room faced the street and noise insulation was not good there was a lot of street noise which made it difficult to sleep my room was opposite the lift which was an extra disturbance there was no room service as far as i was aware and i was not given information about the hotel bistro breakfast room my friend stayed in a five star hotel with sea views for the same price so universal was not good value in my opinion 
 the price
 nothing
 nothing
 there was a bug in our bed the tv didn t work at all didn t have any signal you would think paying 100 for a more senior room they would check the tv it smelt of damp and the shower was freezing cold although i put the hot on full there was woodlice in the room hence why i found one in the bed plus all the wood of the bathroom door was chipped off i never ever complain about a room even if i didn t like it but when i emailed the manager i didn t even get a response back 
 the place has definitely passed its prime and is in need of some serious renovation the staff at the reception during checkin was very rude
 we went for a king room as we have stayed in a standard room before and found it quiet small but we re disappointed as the room we paid for was not any bigger and the 4th floor room no 415 the ceiling was so low hit my head a couple of times and i am only 5ft 3inches 
 the hotel appears to have a high turnover of one night coach visitors during the summer so breakfast check in and elevators can be overloaded on occasion 
 card had to exchange often because it did not work any more 
 everything fine as usual if i may say just one thing beds were not the best comfort but anyway totally ok 
 no iron available
 nothing
 the only fact that i missed breakfast
 the rooms were extra small
 there should be a few english tv channels 
 breakfast in bed was cold i do find alot of really good hotel still can t manage to get this right 
 bit dated could do with redecoration
 no window in the bathroom but this seems to be a recurring thing in the uk i ve found 
 the coffee machine did not work even after reporting it it was not fixed meaning no morning coffee 
 reception staff rude unhelpful
 london prices for hotels 
 a little less hygienic than i expected a little difficult to enter to the hotel late at night as it s through a ground floor restaurant 
 noisy big boats and impersonal place far from the city center 
 the cleanless was verry poor there were junk in both of the night draws and safetybox they send housekeeping to clean it up after long time and whitevine that cost them 7 or so i wanted to hear from the manager but never did the stay cost over 1500 for four days and they short on staff and all the rooms are old and out off date 
 breakfast was a little bit poor not sure if because was sunday but there was no fresh bread available just some bread slices to toast
 no dislikes
 the rooms were very old fashioned and in desperate need of upgrading i booked a double room and was given a room with 3 single beds had to pay more for a double room which i booked and paid for thought booking com
 double room a bit too small for 2 people 
 the lift seems not functioning properly noise no kettle provided 
 the shower did not work well very very old 
 the location is quite far from the centre but there s a sight seeing bus stop right in front so it wasn t too inconvenient
 staff service condition of room price
 rooms are quite aged curtain nets were almost black with dirt
 shuttle service to and from schiphol airport my two taxi trips cost me more than one nights stay at the urban lodge 
 the room i stayed in was really small the toiletries were uninspiring 
 the hotel is based on the second floor in what looks like a regular residencial property so no standard hotel entrance from outside ater taking a lift to the floor where the hotel is based there is closed door to the hotel and we had to ring a few times before somebody opened the door a few minutes later slightly odd arrangement if you got used to regular hotels 
 checking in at 3 is a bit late no room service
 room size 
 the food 
 the hotel was very loud throughout the night after midnight someone was running construction equipment for at least 25 minutes 
 watch the steps ladder into the pool the power sockets to the kettle meant you had to make a cup of tea on the floor the shower flooded the bathroom in 10 minutes so the enviro towel policy was useless
 why don t you try to put heaters under hot food like eggs bacon and sausages 
 the night shift receptionist is very rude the stairs of the hotel are locked if you can t use the elevator because you are afraid of it the receptionist has to unlock the door for you the night shift receptionist will give you the answer i don t care if you ask him to unlock 
 gym was filthy treadmills covered in dust check in process took around 45 minutes with no apology or explanation from management 
 nothing except the gym needs improvement and i wish it had better equipment 
 everything was perfect
 the reception staff are expected to also handle the call center which besides delays to guest seems to also cause frustration to the staff themselves 
 the bed needs a better mattress the quality was not there for the price of the room that was paid 
 it could be a little cheaper and the view of the eiffel tower is not as i saw from the photos 
 no parking at hotel
 would loved for there to have been a few more sunbeds around the pool 
 slippery floor in otherwise good shower cell
 minor stuff maid disregarded our do not disturb sign each day to clean and was a bit overzealous with disposing of small items breakfast buffet each day but one was cleared promptly without any mention that a clean sweep was coming and one day we seemed to be served by a guy who failed the drug screens at his last gig absent and forgetful no washcloths provided as per standard european hotel practice 
 nothing
 location
 nothing
 the service in general
 a little far from city but that isn t such a bad thing train station is nearby which is just a few stops from central 
 though it wasn t a problem for us the room is a split level so there are stairs 4 steps i think from the hall bathroom area and closet sitting area down to the bedroom area this could be difficult at night if someone needed to get to the bathroom in the dark also we would have chosen to make the room cooler than the air conditioning allowed it wasn t bad but the option to lower the temperature below 21 5 c about 70 f would have been more comfortable for us one problem one evening we came in to our room and it had a bad sewer smell we called the front dest and they had someone take care of whatever was going on by the following morning it didn t happen again 
 negatives breakfast too expensive at 18 50 each and drinks expensive on roof top bar 
 the room ceilings could do with a paint 
 street noise from a neighbouring night club fri sat night 
 area around the hotel a bit dicey at night limited shelving or storage for clothes
 delayed check in at 6 pm
 most satisfactory overall 
 the public areas and room were just far too hot the whole time turn down the heating 
 this was the first hotel in holland where we stayed we arrived early morning in holland after a 10 hour flight so we where very tired but couldn t check in untill 2pm the lady on the reception was very nice but there was also a guy who was very rude we ask around 1pm if there was already a room available and he just let us stand there while not checking anything after a while he started a discussion with another receptionist who is gonna call to check if there is a room the hospitality really needs to be worked on also the a c in our room did not work and we had to call the reception to control the a c from somewhere else so we could not manage the a c ourself the price is way to high for what you get i expected to be more luxury and better service 
 there was some water damage in the bathroom to the mdf furniture which could have easily been repaired 
 long queue at check in and 50 debited and held on my credit card account for nearly a week before being refunded 
 there were issues concerning the cleanliness of the room details maybe but couldn t remain unnoticed if traveling with kids it s helpful to have in mind that the bathtub is inside the room 
 the air con in the room didn t seem to work properly it was very hot even when i set it on the coldest option it would have been nice to have a double bed rather than two twins for the superior double room 
 dark corridors
 i was travelled with my old father and we were given a twin room with facilities intended for the disabled without prior notice the setting and facilities of the room kept reminding my father of one in a home for the elderly i could not use wifi in my room but the staff said that it was the problem of iphones but not theirs 
 despite the hotel is brand new and was opened 3 weeks ago hotel felt old in terms of furniture floors and even the color mix is ugly moreover the reception area is tiny and there is no in room service menu 
 street noise specifically buses backing up with warning hazard beeps day and night 
 see above
 noise filtering up from the piazza duomo at night
 room very nicely decorated and well equiped but needs to be refreshed furniture sofa carpet room not well isolated against noise from street window next to bed could not be closed properly window lock missing with no blackout curtains problems with internet connection in the room maybe because in the highest floor of building rooms are better in the modern building opposite side of street but with less charm some changes are needed to keep the already high attractiveness of your hotel location prices 
 they have provided coffee tea sugar and 2 cups however no coffee kettle available when i requested the kettle they said your room level can t have one i said then why you provide these facilities they couldn t answer the location is not near the center nor the shopping facilities 
 nothing
 lack of a restaurant at the hotel
 drinks a little pricey 
 the tv did not work most of the time also the phone between rooms didn t work so i had to call my daughter in her room via my mobil which is an international call 
 mattress a bit too hard
 we re picky pillow people and they weren t the best but certainly not the worst 
 slowly wi fi
 the smoking area is at the door of the hotel everyone throws the butts on the floor and no one cleans it the first impression when you arrive at the hotel is not good the location is not good because it is mainly a turkish area and there is not much to do if you are not turkish but the public transport to the centre of town is excellent 
 they only received the booking for two adults although i had booked for two adults and a child had to change our room and make up a sofa bed for us also although i specified breakfast on my booking this didn t get to the hotel they did not have breakfast already on their records also both of these thing happened last year when we booked through bookings com for the same hotel 
 everything was great 
 aircon not working told it to the staff a couple of times technician couldn t fix it very disappointed
 good location
 attitude of the concierge and some receptionists charging a deposit for an umbrella is not acceptable which is annoying to even ask for a 10 gbp deposit for it where all other hotels are throwing at you foc poor room conditions really worn down needs refurbishing badly and needs to be upscaled a bit 
 expensive
 breakfast was very nice but i thought the price 14 was rather expensive
 room keeping could be better ie coffee tea was not replenished bed wasn t changed in 3 nights the bathroom had a strange unpleasant smell like moss or humidity but it was clean the room in the basement right under the reception was loud lucky i sleep deep 
 rooms very small with noise from room next door breakfast expensive 20 euros irrespective of what you eat 
 our double room was extremely clean and modern but too small for 2 adults for 2 nights no wardrobe or anywhere to put luggage which was a shame but would still reccomend
 bed was hard pillows almost non existent the rooms are quite small for the price 
 nothing
 one false alarm at 0230am no indication no explanation no excuse the next day 
 perhaps a few more drinking glasses in the room at least four as we brought some wine and had to ask in reception for glasses 
 croissants could have been better if warmed
 unfortunately if there was anything it would be that there was no tea towel or a small sachet of washing up liquid for washing up considering it was self catering but other than that small thing it was faultless 
 squeaky floor boards small room no view no breakfast included 12 hard to flush toilet this is what we paid for 184 for 1 night overall i think you could do better if you book early enough we couldn t 
 the bar could do with a little more selection of drinks as they only did one beer also i thought the breakfast was very expensive at 16 per day per person there was an offer on of 10 when we stayed but we decided to go out each day to eat 
 external view
 nothing
 i booked one night at the marriott london country hall and when i arrived they sent me in another marriott hotel in hyde park and the reason was we re fully booked i asked why did you not tell me that and they answer me with sorry but we hadn t a email address or mobile phone number and this is a very stupid answer because i couldn t book without those informations and i also ordered a room with river view paying more and obviously they gave me a wall view hotels are cute but never again after this adventure 
 there was a albeit light garbage smell at the aisle probably because my room was on the first floor and close to the street 
 towels stored very high in bathroom hard to reach when you are short nowhere to put soap in the shower cubicle 
 air conditioning did not work even after a visit from staff the shower directed the water at the ceiling rather than downwards had obviously been doing this for some time as the ceiling was damaged when reported to reception staff this was met with an uncommitted response and no apology 
 the room was a little on the small side 
 sky bar could be improved e g open top with better views music was a bit dated 
 double room was two singles pushed together no complimentary biscuits in the room 
 it needs better maintenance
 1 very weak wifi signal almost no internet was accessible however thanks to the neighbouring hotel which has very good wifi coverage with free access it really saved us 2 bathroom was not very well ventilated so when jet bathtub was activated it was very hot in the room there is a small window in the niche of the bathtub but opening of the window is restricted 3 a bit far off the city center about 20 min of walking 4 too expensive
 checkin agent confirmed a double bed when we found a twin in the room slow elevators overpriced bad room design light switches shower 
 breakfast to be included in the price
 our room was off the main area in a stairwell which appeared to be the staff quarters poorly lit room and no view 
 the room and bed are very small
 i had a 7 night stay and was put in a room where i had to keep the curtains closed all day as there was a walkway beside my window doors that let everyone see in as they walk past for a 7night stay this isn t fair and yes i raised it with staff on 3 different occasions to be told impossible to move rooms and just check each day or pay more for a better room how about you offer to let me know when an alternate room is available i m the guest customer not the source of all of your problems problem was i had already paid a premium price for this hotel and was not happy to upgrade also the housekeeping staff have no concept of noise door slamming talking and excessive banging noises is not ok in a hotel like this and what type of hotel doesn t even have facial tissues in the bathroom sorry to burst the bubble but i stay in hotels all around the world for work and at every point in my 7 days here i was constantly let down and disappointed at a stay that wasn t relaxing i gave the staff 3 chances to rectify and nothing happened not even my leaking toilet complaint for 3 days straight sorry but the rooms are tiny and it s not as boutique as stated just a lot of smoke and mirrors 
 rooms very small first room we were shown had a flight of stairs just inside the door extremely dangerous 
 noises of the staff cleaning outside the room and making so much noise that after 3 nights i started to believe that they do noises on purpos
 the room was not clean on arrival service was slow and room service did not restock the room after cleaning 
 booked 2 nights but had to convince hotel staff on 4 occasions that i had two nights as the hotel system seemed to have me for only one night this meant 3 trips to reception the same staff member and an a visit by staff to my room key deactivated after day one poor 
 poor breakfast buffet
 very noisy hotel could hear roof top bar in our 3rd third floor room at 12 45 am changed too second floor then we could hear nightclub over the rd plus people in street shouting and fighting until 3 30am thats when the the dust carts and cars started got to sleep 6 30 am breakfast was included in our stay however we were given a price list and were told if we had a full english then we would have to pay extra for anything else ie fruit cereal pastries or toast 
 bed was uncomfortable and having to order a pizza online and collect it from the lobby wasn t whati expected by way of room service
 double glazing as road noise was still audible at times air con also quite noisy
 there is nothing we did not like we have already recommended this hotel to a friend 
 it might sound funny but the room was too hot 
 
 the matress was a bit old it lost its tone on the the edges so one always felt like one was falling off the bed the coffee was made with long life milk yuk 
 nothing
 chic but very business like neighborhood no nightlife whatsoever in the surrounding neighborhood not much amenities and very small 
 the location was not bad but can t see view of eiffel tower even bit the maid didn t fill out the mini bar in the room we have to call reception almost everyday 
 the breakfast lacks a bit of variety 
 only one bottle of water and one glass got a double room hello would like a bath sheet rather than small bath towel
 nothing to complain
 n a
 room was extremely hot horrible view
 the hotel quite far from tube but there are sainsbury and tesco near by the hotel
 poor breakfast for cost very small rooms
 small room not modern and very scruffy shower didn t work properly drafty window
 no free wifi in room
 breakfast not up to standard and the restaurant very small not sufficient for all the guest in the hotel in fact if you come at specific time you may not find a table 
 breakfast was very expensive we were asked straight away whether we wanted tea or coffee 10 minutes later nothing nobody came to see if we wanted to order anything eventually i asked where our tea coffee were and nobody knew loads of staff attending to the buffet nobody taking responsibility for customers needless to say i removed the discretionary service charge which for an expensive buffet restaurant is an absolute con i will definitely stay again but definitely wont have breakfast 
 i had to check in twice because the staff at the reception lost the signed checkin papers the services were very poorly and the mini bar was empty during our stay the tea and complementary coffee were not renewed and i had to ask for tea and coffee bags to be brought to the room every single day the toilet papers were not replaced even when they finished the room service and the hotel bar closed at 23 00 without any notice during the checkin despite the fact that the closure time as indicated on the menu was 1 00 am 
 few light on the bathroom mirror 
 our request for the room raised at the reservation was not entertained no kettle in the room however the staff was nice to deliver us hot water twice 
 the decor is a little tired could do with some updates 
 only flaw was our experience in the executive lounge for happy hour we sat for 25 minutes completely ignored we said hello to each of the two staff in the room and still received no service we walked out and back to our room i complained to the front desk they refunded the room upgrade and provided a 4 99 bottle of red wine sent to the room as well as a bottle of juice for our son 
 small bedroom
 no negative comments at all 
 was difficult trying to get from the airport to this hotel using public transport so ended up getting a taxi 
 room size extremely small i think room size quoted included shower room compared to other hotels we have stayed the quoted room size did seem correct tv signal poor on night of our stay picture flickering with distorted sound reception staff not real friendly had to wait at reception for staff to attend desk for check in and check out 
 i emailed the property prior to arrival asking if i could arrange for breakfast in bed for my girlfriends birthday as a surprise but it was not catered for there was no reply from the property 
 room very smart but a little small 
 i wish that the people that we re working there could pay more attention to our need of help sometimes when we asked for the trams and shuddles it was a bit difficult for them to understand what we really need help with 
 no air con
 cooked breakfast was stone cold when i alerted the waiter restaurant manager he was not very receptive 
 having to boil the kettle at floor level using the only available plug socket
 the beds were a little uncomfortable and lack of plugs at the side of the bed
 i was put in a twin room not the double i had booked and the bed was short and uncomfortable i do expect to be given a double if that is what i have booked they gave me free breakfast which was nice but i was tired after a very poor night s sleep 
 room was a pocket with a view to a scaffolding 
 there was no hot water for a shower when we first arrived we had cold showers the selection of teas and coffee to make in the room was mean for the price we were paying i would expect real coffee and the teas to include a normal everyday tea with milk 
 bit slow service at the breakfast always something missing from the buffet and it took long for the staff to bring out more bad coffee and juices and water not cold 
 not enough wardrobe space didn t like the glass door to the toilet cobwebs on the ceiling
 we were instructed to pay our bill on checking in and then had to pay cash when room service ordered 
 need ac instructions as mentioned didn t care for our daughter s open floor plan with the sink in the room as she was using it as a single it didn t bother her at all our room next door had the traditional closed bathroom would also strongly prefer a sheet enclosed comforter i hate traditional blankets in hotels you never know when they get washed and since we couldn t figure out the ac it was freezing and we needed it went to enjoy the hot tub but it wasn t hot 
 not the nicest neighborhood but we wanted to be near central station for easy access to the train to the expo the bed was a little hard and there were a few things that needed repair in the bathroom 
 stayed 4 nites room was not completed by housekeeping most days forgot to make the bed one day replenishing amenities was spotty breakfast chaotic staff seemed willing but perhaps not well directed porridge was curious but not good and coffee access required much patience no how was your stay at checkout leading me to surmise that my criticisms would not be helpful also suggest hotel closer to an underground station if that matters to a potential guest 
 the shower the pillows nothing to do in surrounding area nothing even in hotel 
 n a
 the room was really dirty a lot of dust in uncommon areas to clean like the closet or the walls window had a fantastic view of a giant poster that was pretty lame 
 check in staffs were very slow 
 fridge in room was a bit noisy and could not locate a switch to turn off as we were not using it but this is a minor fault 
 nothing 
 check out could be a little bit faster especially since we paid everything at check in 
 it locates within the walking distance to duomo cathedral but the condition of the hotel is not satisfactory the room is way too small and the facilities really need to be updated comparing with its neighbor hotel the square this hotel is not highly recommended 
 1 menus in austrian german alienate foreign guests do something about this please the staff can not be expected to effectively convey translate the menu into similar foreign tastes that they have little to no experience of it makes the dininng experience some what limiting and un comfortable 2 sink in the room was way too small 
 whenever another guest used their bathroom it sounds like niagra falls in own bedroom 
 there was not one thing i did not like about this hotel and staff
 on ground floor near reception so door to corridor banged regularly was not asked how my stay was when checking out
 nothing
 toiletries in bathroom were very inadequate
 breakfast not included and too expensive to add but not great problem as coffee machine in room 
 the wifi was a bit of a pain and slow the room was really small but that is normal for paris
 sunday licensing hours prevented us sampling the cocktail menu but that s not the hotel s fault 
 check in was slightly strange as it took a long time to actually get the room key even though it was late afternoon early evening the reception staff gave the impression there was a problem but didn t provide any reassurance during the process 
 wifi was barely useble 
 distance from the main parts
 i didn t like the idea of waiting another 2 hours after check in time terrace rooms are claustrophobic
 the rose wine could of been nicer but i have to find something to moan about lol
 i came with family and we felt the room carpet was not clean it felt itching we sat on the carpet also it seems the floors in the hotel were made of wood as we can hear the walking steps from people in the room above us luckliy it went quiet when it was time for bed however there was another source of noise in the room that sounded like a discontinuous extractor or fan and was noisey to me i reported that to the reception who attempted to resolve it but it didn t work so i had to wear ear plugs to be able to sleep 
 tray charge 
 arrival we had to queue which took a while
 air conditioning was defect
 breakfast that is inclusive in the package is not serve automatically and not being explain if what is included and what is with additional charges we waited an hour for the main course to be served in the club lounge 
 the double beds are comfortable but to small 
 very pricy 200 dollars per night but no breakfast 
 food
 was good
 gym is underwhelming too small too few pieces of equipment to be of any use the bar at the roof is empty 
 perfect
 no internet first day and no cold water in the morning on two days impossible to shower with boiling water
 some staff were not fluent in english and some things got lost in translation 
 no gym
 price is a little expensive for what you get have stayed in bigger rooms in other city centres for less with breakfast included but if you want to be close to dam square and have friendly staff with a comfy bed then it is a good place to stay 
 the hotel was very warm it was 23 c outside and there was very little cooling in the public areas 
 the location was ok just a little out of the way 
 no gym need to walk a few blocks to get to the local gym but it s a good one 
 having to pay for internet feels like a rip off as it s a necessity in this day and age we were not allowed in our room for 7 hours due to an arranged power cut not communicated to us at any point before arrival but still not offered free internet to soften the blow the lifts are pretty tedious cocktail bartenders were not great in service or technique the mini bar was dirty and still had the previous guests yoghurt inside it wasn t stocked but we were happy with that in the knowledge it s always a rip off 
 it is what it is 
 i swear nothing and i kid you not
 no coffee sachets in the room asked at reception and none there either not impressed that their policy is to scan your credit card if you don t have photo id
 bed on the firm side 
 very little was unlikeable 
 checkin early option
 basic customer services related to faulty things in room
 this is not a real critic but i think that the room design has been thought for pictures to be able to be best shared on social media etc it is not possible to take a bad pic of the room or the bathroom the lights and mirrors are perfectly set and everything looks beautifully art deco 
 failed to hv soya milk for breakfast
 i pad in room was empty and could only be charged when holding in hand so switching on tv or films became tricky
 no air con and we needed it windows limited opening reception staff not over friendly and over charged till we complained very expensive esp as no air con check in took a long time 
 the booking had said inclusive of breakfast then turned out not to be
 nothing
 there was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot the staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates the staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing so our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant 
 full english breakfast was an option
 a bigger pool would have been better
 in the restaurant there were many bones in the fish fillet 
 room clean enough but very small and too warm paint flaking off the bathroom ceilng hotel very old fashioned i choose it for the pool but on a sunday morning its used for childrens swimming lessons local shops do not buy from the shops just up the street they charge stupidily 
 the pillows far too soft impossible to get a good night s sleep which is a shame as the beds are fabulous please offer a choice of pillows as standard 
 airco noice on the six floor 
 we were charged for breakfast when we had already paid at point of booking and this was challenged information at booking com is ambiguous 
 the bathroom was a bit moldy 
 no usable power plugs in the room most sockets had some weird round three prong system presumably to avoid being used for anythin else this is 2016 we all have a mobile phone to plug in come on the bed was very creaky and not that comfortable bathroom is too small had to manoeuver around the tiny space which is where the door opens where you get out of the bath shower and where you use the sink 
 there was no single bed and two double were very uncomfortable 
 nothing
 booked a superior room with breakfast didn t get a superior room and they tried to charge me for a breakfast that i had already paid for 
 very noisy inside hotel room able to hear neighbours coughing televisions doors etc 
 nothing
 hotel needs some renovation so it is more business style than leisure 
 very difficult to work the lighting in the room
 nothing
 the apartment smelt of smoke things were a little basic nothing high end it was just pretty ordinary the dress gown had sadly seen better days house keeping woke us up 9am and kept knocking until i answered school kids behind the hotel can make some noise staff which smoke could make some attempt to freshen up before coming into your room or being in close contact with guests overall it was ok 
 paying 3 50 fir a bottle of water none provided no tea bags awful internal view lighting terrible
 the shower had a tendency to go hot cold whilst showering which made you do a little dance when it suddenly goes cold 
 would have liked to reserve table in the bar
 no elevator near the lobby very inconvenient for hotel customers esp if you have a big luggage and the service lift was located in a place where you can not find it easily the door is too heavy and the space inside is so small another downside of the hotel is they do not automatically replenish the the toiletries everyday after they clean the room you have to request for it 
 to single beds pushed together fell in between them twice and bathroom was dirty wooden floor was coming up would of not said a 4 star hotel 
 poor leisure facilities quite expensive
 not in a good street but safe hair dryer is old type and not strong enough to dry long hair some room doors are very close to each other so that you should wait for others to enter into their room for you to enter 
 a bit too far from the closest metro station 20min walk 
 it was a little expensive but it met all our expectations ok there was a gentle rumble from the underground but hey you are in london 
 the room was very small the cleaning was very bad the beds were badly made the towels ware not changed very bad experience wouldn t stay there again 
 all very good especially for the price
 no shelving so there was limited space to put our things perhaps the telephone coffee table could be replaced by a chest of drawers 
 reception staff could of been friendlier pool opens at 10am so no time for a swim before work
 hotel needs some refurbishment ie carpets and blinds pillows very hard but lovely big bed if also a little hard
 nothing really it was all good just maybe a little expensive compared to other hotels but the location made up for that 
 no european hotel room has much space but that is a minor concern 
 the bed mattress was ok ish but not top quality 
 nothing 
 no coment 
 advanced payment problems ineptitude with bank card processing i had to ask bank to relax security for this transaction wired deposit 50 euro day for already prepaid stay inadequate information about what is included in the price
 nothing
 nothing
 shower and cubicle updated
 the size of room the tiny bed address in google maps take you to a bike shop check in was difficult as was booked under wife s name wouldn t accept id with marching address and surname tap was wrong way round nearly scolded myself the breakfast was cold and tasteless and of poor quality 
 nothing
 housekeeping was fair at best else everything else was perfect
 nothing
 the hotel is tucked away means it is quite quiet but difficult to find the entrance 
 not a boutique hotel as it sells itself more like a tired and v expensive b b room too small and generally needed a face lift not value for the money 
 rooms staff service
 toiletries wifi was erratic and difficult 
 problems with a hot water in the morning breakfast in completely different building in university campus hard to find
 expensive car parking uncomfortable pillows poorly designed bathroom
 nothing
 the bathroom was a bit small 
 most staff were not attentive to us or didnt seem to care or be helpful i dont want to play the race card but that seemed to be the only plausible explanation we were not assisted with our luggage to our rooms we were not even shown to the lifts which were in some corner although we had witnessed how helpful and willing to help they were with other guests on one day my husband got in the lift with an elderly couple and you could see how they physically clinged to one another and made sure that when they got off on their floor they shut the lift door behind them one of those ancient open the door lifts so he could not follow them it was quite upsetting maybe not many black people stay in such nice hotels 
 the fixtures were slanted so we were unable to put a glass of water or cup of tea on them without them sliding off the bath plug did not fit the plug hole so we were not able to have a bath only showers tv has subtitles you are unable to switch off and the wifi was useless 
 the spa was very small no relaxing seating area
 nothing not to like if you are happy to go out for breakfast
 i am very unhappy with the stay we had here we checked in for a night s sleep and the room was right by the dlr stop so it was really noisy nobody told us this and we only managed to sleep between 1am 5am when the dlr wasn t running my partner tried to get us moved when we checked in but they fobbed us off then i called angrily at 5am and they moved us but the new room was dirty and also noisy awful stay i complained and got nowhere my 8am meeting was a shambles as i was so exhausted at least places like premier inn have the good night guarantee so if you don t sleep they refund your money i asked about this and was fobbed off by the staff at the hotel terrible place dirty noisy rooms and rude unattentive staff 
 glass table in lounge the glass was not connected to the table this was extremely dangerous and could break someones foot 
 air conditioning was horrible location was terrible elevators old and slow as a conclusion it wasn t like a 4star hotel
 the bun fight to get breakfast the breakfast area was very poorly designed and laid out causing question to get food which had a knock on effect as people then had to cue for tables
 swimming pool the water was very cold
 nothing it was very good
 the wifi was spot at best not working at worst 
 parking position
 breakfast not hot enough
 everything was well done 
 nothing 
 powered milk for tea and coffee in the room was quite expensive although i presume that is the going rate in a city
 breakfast
 room was quite small for a family room 
 the breakfast is so simple considering the hotel price 
 cleaning 
 it was perfect will definitely stay there again 
 nothing 
 despite requesting a double bed we got two singles also the room only had one bath towel and hand towel when we arrived while only a small amount of money the city tax was a surprise the sauna and gym were tiny 
 tiney bit of smok smell in the room and ssmall bathroom however there is nothing you can do about the structure
 nothing
 wish i could have stayed longer 
 nothing
 buffet breakfast could have been better 
 my brother and i didn t really like the shower in our bathroom because it made weird and loud noises as soon as we turned it on 
 breakfast was average little or no vegetarian choise 
 leaky shower and air con not working properly so bit too warm charge extra for car parking 
 place needs serious restoration building is old and worn down nowhere near 4 stars 
 the table in our room haf crumbs on it the door to our first room wouldnt open the cleans walked in without knocking even tho we asked for late check out
 good for a one night experience not worth the money for a longer stay many hotels in the area are nice and less expensive we stayed a wednesday and thursday tried to extend it by one day due to our flight and the price doubled to 1000 for a friday so we had to leave and find a different hotel for one night 
 bed was like a brick for near 300 2 night stay room only double bed against a wall so one had climb over supposed to be a hotel not a caravan paper thin walls could hear conversations and sanitary very noisy customers either side 6ish hours sleep in 2 nights rang reception got no response 
 tea coffee facility in room not replenished after first night cups not washed stains on bathroom floor particularly around toilet base told reception when checking out had impression apology was lip service 
 first night clerks poor room choice placed in tiny basement room no phone reception hair dryer and window view of staff break area 
 nothing to dislike
 nothing to complain about some little wear and tear in the room room 502 but i am sure it will be looked after 
 the building is dated
 thehotel is not as as central as we usually like 
 wi fi in a hotel room is not an added service to be charged for it s a basic utility like electricity or water this hotel needs to join the 21st century 
 the bed sheets had mascara on them and the shower was barely a trickle
 nothing special
 for the price of the rooms i don t think children should be aloud the use of the spa facilities after 7pm also could have been notified there were kids swimming lessons taking place 
 
 no water in pantry and bottle of water expensive
 quality for paid wifi was awful needs improvement
 room cleaning time reception is busy
 the only thing i suppose i could say bad about the hotel was the price of drinks from the mini bar in our room were very expensive but that s not much of a problem as there is a tesco express practically next door 
 rooms are too small not recommended for family with children
 linenes are near the ground it must not touch to the ground in bedroom the room is too small a little bit it must be big
 hotel has no reception
 the pillows on the bed too soft and once in the bed the quilt was too small for the bed
 bed uncomfortable room decor average breakfast average
 ejected from pool area suddenly due to a private function unacceptable as we paid for the facilities there was no notice given and no apology one of the main reasons we selected this hotel was the pool 
 staff
 room very small no view from window
 nothing the hotel is excellent and worthy to visit again and again 
 the hotel structure was different difficult to find because no traditional hotel entrance should have been made aware of this
 daily noise in the cortyard and in the very early morning
 the overall cost was at the top end 
 traffic noise too much next time i will request a room on the other side 
 being asked if we would like a morning paper and not being told we would have to pay for it in other 5 hotels we have stopped in the newspaper is free 
 stuff was stuck up restaurant and reception area 
 some aspects a bit over priced for example a dairy milk chocolate bar was 4 
 nil
 gardens closed room amenaties poor had to unplug fridge to boil kettle no tv remote on arrival shoe box bathroom 
 unwelcoming staff in the reception and bar i felt like they just try to get rid of me when i was checking in the staff at breakfast was very kind and helpful unfortunately the breakfast it self was not very good selection ok but the quality was poor the facilit is not properly maintained the shower was not pleasant they charge 7 euros for a bottle of bier i normally don t pay attention to the minibar prices but after been charged the same in the bar i had to check why 7 euros for a bottle this is italy not a country with alcohol prohibition finally i believe it was not worth the 200 euros a night 
 this hotel is outdated and smelled like my grandmothers house there wasn t views of anything construction ongoing woke me up early the first was mediocre at best 
 the tv was confusing to work and not many english chanel s 
 room not cleaned and when we questioned why we were told that they didn t have time we asked for it to be cleaned and went for a coffee whilst it was done unfortunately when we went back to our room it still had not been done we were approached by the floor manager who made it clear that we were being a nuisance the room was eventually given a superficial clean by an employee who didn t want to be there 
 rooms slightly small
 the air conditioning emitted a screeching noise that prevented me sleeping so had to turn the air off this was during a very hot spell which also meant i didn t sleep i had to work the next day so i was really unhappy about that the kitchen closes totally at 10 p m so no room service nothing not even a sandwich the hotel is remote i needed cash but there were no atms close by luckily taxis take credit cards 
 it was very expensive and the check in process was very slow
 1 very disappointed with the signposting to the property we drove around and up down the a40 until we had to stop and call for directions into the entrance even then we were told by the receptionist to drive to the small street which i gather meant a side street even then the signposts were so small it was difficult to enter at the right place 2 the floors in the room were laminate and not carpet which were very noisy 3 whilst in the shower 2 people entered our room they were issued with the same room keys as us room 213 thankfully we were in the room as they entered however we had valuables with us and had we already gone out as was the reason for our stay it could ve been a different storey as there was no safe in the room 4 no towel rail apart from 2 hooks in the shower not impressed at all 
 none
 more choice at breakfast as the price is quite high could have also some simple options like just egg and toast also need maybe more than one chef at the breakfast had to wait long although we really appreciated cooked on order idea
 someone had sex on the terrace outside my window
 the room was the tiniest room i have ever stayed in and as such the value for money is disappointing there was not enough room to walk around the bed i would not stay here again because of this 
 breakfast was unfortunately cold and to my husbands dismay there was no brown sauce
 the toilet door was a sliding door and the beds were very low on the ground 
 wifi wasn t working sometimes room is small 
 only 2 baby chairs for such a big hotel a lot of parents had to have their small children on their lap the breakfast was nice but no where near as it is presented on the homepage 
 our room wasn t ready at the time it should of been and they gave us the wrong room initially so we had to go back and they changed it 
 not enough staff for checkin checkout reception phone never answered 24 7 food service doesn t incude all option 24 7 rooms too small
 the bar wasn t open late enough
 initial connection to internet can take many minutes dhcp server overwhelmed 
 everything worse experience ever
 there as a really good choice of breakfast food but the cooked breakfast was a little bit tired by the time we came to eat it 
 only a few minor issues the robes weren t in the room on arrival and a few basic toiletries missing also some of the tv channels didn t work and we had to keep turning the tv off and on 
 breakfast for a little chaotic got the tea and coffee but had to ask for milk then for a cup got knife and folk but had to ask for a spoon when the tea arrived it was earl grey and not breakfast tea not sure the waitress understood english top tip check in early otherwise you end up with a disabled room as has happened to me on two consecutive visits 
 mattres was hard
 poor function of air conditioning limited storage space
 when i made the booking i requested a twin room but had to have a double room which was very awkward as i was sharing with my brother i complained but they couldn t change our room till the next day i will book direct with hotel next time 
 room was a bit small
 sometimes the wifi didn t work in our room 
 we ordered a room for three adults and i specifically asked for three beds yet one of the beds was an uncomfortable folding sofa 
 nothing 
 i can t think of a thing 
 quite pricy long queue at checkout slow programmable lift system
 didn t have breakfast at the hotel as it was a bit pricey and not included in room rate but loads of cafes nearby
 furniture is quite old and some rooms should be re freshened 
 small room very slow wi fi
 nothing at all breakfast may be included to booking com price it was 19 euro per person and extra for our staying 
 no fan or air conditioning and room was near a noisy road
 wifi through email account
 additional beds for kids sofa bed was very uncomfortable and smelled because of humidity air conditioning was bad too no fresh air can be found inside building 
 the tv in the bedroom 
 on the original booking they advertised that as it was a luxury suite we would be provided with bathrobes slippers unfortunately these were not provided despite having mentioned it to the staff who said they would attend to it we also mentioned it to the reception on checkout we did get an apology but as we were charged for the luxury suite i felt that they could have offered a discount 
 the towels were worn and the room was tired 
 mainly the advert of their room looks completely different to the actual room 
 no jacuzzi tub
 wifi kept on logging off 
 beds
 towels were smelly at 9 am in the morning a man wearing boilersuit entered the room when i was sleeping and leave the room when he saw me in general rooms must be cleaned after checkout if it is a one night stay but housekeeper came 3 times until my checkout time starting from 9 30 am i think neither housekeepers or workers have no guest list and they are just entering the room whenever they want 
 the check in after a 9 hour flight took 2 1 2 hours shower had no ventilation no blinds on the window the breakfast was a disaster every day the food was terrible and i mean terrible the elevators fit three ppl with medium sized suitcases and take 20 minutes to show up and are always packed with other people the hotel is surrounded by two abandoned buildings which makes it feel very unsafe 
 o air con and the little fan made no difference was unable to sleep
 not overwhelmed by the hotel as a whole could hear through the walls slightly flimsy luxurious extras nespresso machine unnecessary bathroom products only ok 
 the fact that we could not open the windows 
 wifi was extremely bad kept disconnecting and completely unreliable ruined the experience throughout my entire stay room service menu as well as my one time lunch in the restaurant the menu is small and food wasn t as good as expected and definitely wasn t worth the price paid
 the price of the internet was way too high 
 poor wifi not nice view from bedroom 
 cramped shower room wc poor quality toilet paper despite excellent toiletries and facilities 
 the fact we had to leave at all 
 no floor heating in the bathroom small breakfast selection 
 nothing
 no hot tub just cold bubbles and jets
 typical london hotel over priced for a tired old building tiny room they refused us breakfast as they said it was not included in room rate they were wrong but there was no time to argue 
 nothing
 no fitness facilities and no bath 
 the only thing that put me off a little was the price i d say i stayed during nye 
 wifi needs attention 
 nothing to say 
 the swimming pool changing room was too small for the number of people wanting to change at the time we were there there were not enough lockers and there was no dry area of floor to stand on to change 
 was asked if id like a text when our room was ready never got it fire alarm went off 4 times during one night between 3 30am and 4 00am no apology from staff the next day or an explanation as to why 
 they said breakfast wasn t clouded when we checked in then made us pay when we checked out 
 everything was fine 
 there were no tea coffee facilities in room and so family with baby need hot water may not so suitable staff are very friendly but their local knowledge can t be trust 
 that we were placed in a disabled room 
 the room although nice equipped was quite tiny
 being in basement lift not working
 no coffee tea in the room lack of a proper iron corridors in the hotel needs refurbishment gives a complete dull look
 1 we had requested a double bed ended up with two separate bed that were put next to each other 2 found a toenail in the bathroom at check in 
 didn t like the glass door on the bathroom toilet and our inability to shut the door excellent hanging areas in the cupboards but no shelves which made our lovely room look a tip with both suitcases and our clothes on display the whole time
 shower area could use a little attention no good restaurants close by and the one at the hotel is a little bit pricy 
 my room was next to the lift and the sound of the lift was disturbing my sleep and peaceful night 
 small rooms carpets in communal corridors stained and could do with a change uncomfortable children s beds breakfast room too small for the number of guests had to wait 10 minutes before being seated and had more of a canteen feel than a 4 hotel car parking fee of 24 euro per night is the most expensive i ve ever had to pay in any city i ve visited in europe 
 well it was not the hotel my room was in between two families and their childrents were playing and slamming the doors crazy family 
 breakfast was a bit expensive so we decided to go out for breakfast instead but it still looked delicious 
 the bed was not comfortable 
 breakfast price
 maybe the cleanness should be better as when i came the floor wasn t so clean 
 minimal wifi in the bedroom 
 room cleaning and restocking of bathroom items inadequate seating in the lobby was always full need more seats in high season
 narrow corridor
 the temperature in the room was so high it turned my shower gel into liquid we did wonder why the window was wide open when we entered the room for the first time a bad nights sleep as you sweat through the night on top of the bed or have the window open and listen to the city go about its buisiness all night long a shame as the bed was really comfortable the staff cannot make tea the breakfast is shocking first of all it cost 40 for two people for a bowl of serial and some fruit and the full english i had was made with the cheapest of ingredients in my opinion it was cheaper booked in advance but not much weak tea and very strong coffee which we declined to have refilled when offered 
 nothing
 nothing
 i thought the cost of 10 for parking was a bit i used to be 5
 internet reception in the room was poor 
 the area was not to our taste
 nothing
 staff was at times a bit awkward but overall a nice experience 
 breakfast far too expensive also extra charges for wi fi make one feel that it is not a good deal 
 the room was rather filly and the ventilation didn t work as it should
 did not read the fine print our mistake and paid 15 per person for breakfast which was not worth the price also it was very warm in the room guess they do not have the ac on in the fall bad ending as my friend had her carryon bag stolen right from under her nose while waiting for me outside 
 free broadband was poor
 no tea or coffee in room 
 nothing
 first room noisy above underground railway and bed was pull down afair 
 on going renovation
 price of breakfast 
 nothing
 shower is a pain toilet flush not working correctly
 nothing
 a young lady who was in room 104 managed to unlock our door room 108 as we were still inside very worrying and really not happy that she managed to do this 
 shame there were no dressing gowns to go and come from pool for the guests going up and down from there rooms 
 very noisy street uncomfortable beds and pillows bad soundproof horrible smell of canalization from bathroom 
 in the evening i have noticed there was no water from the tap first of all when it happened i was not informed about it and when i rang the reception they kept telling me to wait for half an hour as their maintenance team is already working on it for 2 hours after 2 hours of not being able to use the toilet i finally went down to the reception and complaind about it and the receptionist told me that she can only do and say what she was told to i get that but that should not be the response first she should have apolosiged about the inconvenience any way i was offered another room the following morning when we checked out again there was no apology what so ever i know this is not a 5 star hotel but there is no harm in having 5 star service it doesn t cost any extra money but the effect can be surmounting 
 reception recommended i try the gastropub the jugged hare opposite which i did but i was disappointed not really gastropub quality and my sirloin steak was tough with gristle as was my neighbour s who sent his back note did not try the hotel restaurant itself reception could be better signposted when trying to get from bedrooms back to reception as it is something of a maze 
 the lift is very slow room is small 
 location was terrible absolutely nothing around you could hire bikes if they had more than 4 for 15 euros per bike what a joke should have been complimentary as we were so far away from everything paper cups in room for tea and coffee powered milk what s wrong with proper crockery and proper milk all i can say is we won t be going back 
 nothing 
 breakfast was really poor booking com did not inform us that this was a gay hotel very in your face as its advertised every where in the hotel slightly seedy no tea or coffee making facilities in the room shower room looks directly into the bedroom drinks on the roof bar very expensive the spa is chargeable at 10 euros per person per visit and you advertised this as included gay spa very noisy at night time
 internet access not great 
 the shower leaked there are full length glass panels side by side one of which is the door into the shower and there was a gap between them 
 the water coming out showerhead is not enough for us to wash our body 
 the cost for food in room and restaurants were very expensive parking in hotel car park was very expensive so we parked elsewhere and walked 5 mins and saved 60 
 the toilet door didn t have a lock and it was also the shower door not recommended if staying with friends
 little noise 
 currently under refurbishment and no price reduction to reflect this 
 breakfast was not very good cold coffee and the main food had stood for sometime the eggs were solid the bacon cold and stale also the cost of the drinks expensively
 nil
 cannot fault hotel on any aspect
 the promised direct access to o2 had not been completed yet was not me tinned anywhere and even advertised as a selling point as stay was for 3 days of c2c at the o2 this was a disappointment especially as could not get access to hotel for overnight and hour at the end due to massive queue for public transport luckily weather was good for the extra long way round 
 cleanliness of the room needs definitely more attention friends found cockroach in their room no coats hangers in the corridor
 room was just what was required 
 city tax costs 5 for a day which is really expensive the hairdryer in the hotel room dries your hair in 15 20 minutes it barely works 
 the hotel is quite shabby and needs renovation to match its 4 stars there are rooms beneath the street level so if you re unfortunate to have one of these there is no view neither you can open the window the hotel should inform their guests what room type they will get 
 bathroom a little grubby
 staff struggled to operate the computer equipment and could never find me on the system english of many staff member not that good aircon shocking
 slightly disappointed our room didn t look like the picture online was a very small room 
 hot water isn t working properly in the shower 
 this isn t a great location for sightseeing it s close to the eiffel tower but the other main sights and the centre of the city are a metro ride away and as the metro isn t particularly well designed very long walks to change lines for example this is time consuming we chose this location deliberately though because we were attending concerts at radio france next door and it was convenient for the parc des princes too also it s quite noisy as the hotel is at the junction of major roads and the pont de grenelle and the french toot their horns indiscriminately no tea and coffee making facilities in the room 
 lights are very dim even if you turn on every lamp in the apartment its still pretty dark i know the theme of the hotel is space but its not practical 
 tiny double room with cery craky floors
 in the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk i didn t know what happened the air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature 
 breakfast was a bit unorganised
 i didn t like the policy of the hotel charging your accommodation we stayed for 3 nights and a terrible amount of money is pending for days in my account the hotel held 3 times more the cost of the initial booking causing me problems with the back account 
 nothing
 there was no full length mirror wifi connection was hit and miss the bathroom window was covered with a curtain but i could imagine it could be seen into from a neighbour 
 inexperienced staff at reception both on checkin and checkout 
 i didnt think i would ever write about pillows but they were horror i couldnt sleep half night the pool is very small not like in the photos in rest was ok
 far from center but close to the metro station beach and a large shopping center 
 the oil heater was very noisy especially at around 4am 
 no real concierge service but the front desk receptionists were very knowledgeable they were not able to provide the requested roll away bed despite booking com checking with the hotel before i arrived and verified that special request 
 nothing we couldn t fault it
 breakfast not great value too expensive for what you get 
 1 for a business trip i expect efficiency at london it was very slow and very long waiting 2 the room has no heating only air con very old 3 the room is at the main street just very noisy always
 unsmiling reception staff
 quite pricey i wouldn t have stayed here if i was travelling on my own money no swimming pool fitness centre would have stayed in the nearby doubletree hilton but they had no free rooms 
 the breakfast menu was confusing and the cost was too high 
 feel bad not being able to open the window to air in my room 
 breakfast was ok but for the price we decided to pick something up elsewhere on the second morning
 room size was on the small side
 bed was toooo soft
 construction noise elevator inoperable
 no alcohol served onsite but a great pub around the corner 
 pillows
 i little overpriced considering you still have to travel to the city centre breakfast was lovely but a bit too expensive 
 room was at the front of the hotel and the windows are not thick enough so it was very load had to be moved to the back of the building and then all night there were noises from the fans and machines iron was dirty air con unit in the room was incredibly noisy and had to be turned off 
 personale freddo 
 i forget a bmw jacket in my room in the closet on the hanger with a very important ticket inside for my car parking back at home i called in a couple of hours to ask if they found and if i can have it back some receptionist told me they didn t found anything and i m 100 sure it s there hanging in the room the staff in this hotel is under full critique 
 the price they call their rooms queen rooms which one could stupidly mistake for meaning queen sized bed as opposed to a slightly less small standard room would have booked elsewhere if it had been made clear 
 nothin not to like 
 cannot think of any significant area that needs improvement if the wifi signal could be boosted somewhat that would be great 
 a renovation of the older rooms would be something good but it s not necessary yet
 smelly room as if its not yet clean
 the view wasn t spectacular but i imagine if you specify you want a view they will accommodate you 
 the breakfast was poor all plates smell like eggs i think they put them all in the dishwashers the smell was on the glasses utensils plates etc 
 nothing
 very far from the city center very noisy next to the highway
 the rooms are placed like a maze you go up then down on stairs and no elevator down so you carry your luggage the toilet seat too close to the towel rail heated rail that you can burn yourself sink in the bathroom fit in a very narrow way that there is no place to rest the soap phone was not working on saturday afternoon reception told me no maintenance to replace your phone checked out on monday and still phone not working so you can imagine i had to keep going through the maze back and forth to order food staff is nice but definitely management is absent 
 nothing
 normal internet is for extra cost you get only extremely slow internet for free 
 too many doors to go through in order to get my room which was located at the farthest corner of the hotel especially when you re lugging heavy suitcases however i understand that this is a old building so it s not a big issue for me 
 water in the different small plunge pools in the spa could do with being cleaner dead skin floating around which was pretty off putting 
 small dimly lit room slow internet 
 the cleanliness of the spa and pool area
 no tea coffee facilities in room breakfast not included for price of stay would at least expect these things
 didn t like the hard sell attempt to get us to join the loyalty scheme 
 no bad experience
 nothing
 remote location for leisure travelers
 design of en suite toilet was under lb and very difficult to use bed creaked
 slow wifi not terribly user friendly taps on shower 
 we travelled with a wheelchair user there is a lift to the first floor where the accessible room is but it was tiny and an electric wheelchair would struggle to get in the breakfast room was on the same level and so could be accessed from the bedroom but the reception was down 3 steps so would not be accessible 
 service in the restaurant at breakfast was terrible we ordered tea coffee and toast we waited 40 minutes and the toast arrived cold with no butter no cutlery and no jam etc the tea and coffee never arrived terrible terrible service i had the extra money i paid for breakfast refunded to me 
 i didn t get to stay longer 
 couldn t stay long enough 
 room a bit too small
 bed not very comfy 
 no air conditioning in the room but a fan was provided and if it hadn t been exceptionally warm weather wouldn t have been a problem anyway 
 the hotel is unprepared for adverse event one night there was a power outage and the next morning they did not had anbreakfast menu with the allegations that they could not prepare overnight that is unacceptable for 4 star hotel 
 the rooms are too small
 bar is very quiet and no tv
 breakfast was not included
 no facilities for gym and the garden is bare
 the bed was comfortable but the pillows were too soft and offered no support asked for additional pillows which arrived the same day but could ve done with being firmer 
 the room was too cold and didn t appear to respond when i altered the thermostat i mentioned it on check out and was told that the room unit was probably set to cooling air conditioning rather than heating and that this could only be changed externally by household services which seems a bit odd 
 the bed was a little hard but we still slept ok the wifi worked well but you had to have the tv on to use it which is a little odd not a big deal just a minor inconvenience the rooms felt a bit dated in a bad way and ours had a bit of a mustiness to it again small details but depending on your level of pickiness they may bother you 
 the lighting in the rooms is a bit lacking 
 does not match money value paid at all no concierge to pick bags 4 stars i shall not choose for a second time 
 coffee and tea not well served thick cups cold weak tea bad service 
 a bit of traffic noise and a bit of a draft from the single glazed window but not a show stopper 
 rooms are quite small we could hear noises tv phone ringing form the room next to us
 noisy
 our apartment was tiny i also found that given the price coffee tea and milk should be complimentary 
 they told me it is not allowed to park in street just good for short parking later i found out this rule is for mo fr but i stayed weekend the parking garage is hotel property and cost extra 17eur 
 no coffee in room very small room and bath way expensive was listed with breakfast included hours prior a s a special offer but not valid at check in no water or mini bar on room asked at front desk and none available
 couldn t get reduced rate breakfast for individual nights had to have it for whole stay or not at all 
 room bit noisy from the street 
 the area that the hotel was situated in was dodgy to say the least walking from gare de nord to the hotel did not feel safe especially at night 
 tea coffee facilities in the room
 two flights of stairs to enter and exit the hotel with a lift that was not working a struggle with heavy bags the reception staff just watched me struggle with the bags too very small room this hotel is joined to a residential block of apartments i had to put up with a dog barking for most of the first night would never stay here again 
 the room size was extremely small there was hardly a space to stand in the room 
 taking trains and bus going to amsterdam centraal if you are going back to the hotel after 1 am you need to take the night bus of the cab 
 the water was off from 10am til 4pm and we weren t warned of this until after we had paid with no re imburse 
 the spa was a little small and it only has one room to change 
 the minibar was not refilled with the same quantity as expected
 every thing was brilliant
 small hotel only 2 floors location
 nothing
 parking limited and cramped also a bug bear having to pay extra however it seems to be more the norm now in london
 rooms are quite small and stuffy
 its not so much a case of something i didn t like but i would suggest to management that they look at updating modernising the bedrooms reception and the bar restaurant were fine but the room i was in 166 could do with upgrading in terms of furnishings and fittings compared with other 4 star hotels in london that i have stayed in recently the letting rooms are looking a little dated 
 the breakfast was somehow basic we would have enjoyed an english breakfast the rooms and length of the beds are a bit small especially the single one 43 it may not be a problem unless you are tall but you should inform in advance then i am not sure the cleaning was done properly shampoos soap were replaced and towels too but there were hair remaining in the shower and on the floor in the bathroom and finally the air conditionning was a bit noisy these are information for improvements but we would be happy to come back 
 the bathroom features were not kept correctly running faucets missing stoppers some furniture was broken e g drawer in the desk 
 on this occasion i was give a room without a window which i did not like at all as it was very claustrophobic previously i have had rooms with windows which were excellent it would be nice if all the external windows of the hotel could be cleaned more regularly 
 everything except the location how does booking com appraise this hotel with 4 starts you are deceiving your costumers this hotel deserve 2 starts at max if you would like to try living in a cave then welcome to this hotel the rooms are extremely small the price is very high very poor treatment from the staff very noisy and dirty honestly this was the only bad part of my visit to london 
 reception staff does not smile not friendly at all t check out did not even asked if i needed a taxi 
 long waiting times in reception and in the bar restaurant 
 shower was broken room was very cold in the night they have a bar but it s never open and it closes at 11pm like all the pubs in paddington i was disappointed with the hotel as its 4 star they should accommodate the guests if they want a drink at the bar looks like i ll be staying in the hilton hotel next time 
 never thought that i would have to pay extra to use the pool my daughter was not able to use it one you have to pay extra to use the pool second your payment to use the hotel pool is only for adult usage breakfast not the most appealing and tasteful we were seated at the restaurant and while getting our food the same host seated another family at our table i had to move our drinks to another table and was extremely upset infact my daughter was eating and this host sat this family at our table 
 we only stayed for one night 
 hard bed
 new year s day morning 9 20am house keeping entered my room three times and disturbed my sleep within 45 minutes not good enough 
 that s it only stayed one night it ticked all the boxes
 breakfast was not included in the room rate and cost more than my breakfast allowance so i had to skip it the view from the window was of a yard filled with rubbish bins the window was single glazing there were several air conditioning units on the next building a few metres away which gave a consistent loud hum all through the night leading to two nights of suboptimal sleep 
 extremely disappointed this hotel is a 2 stars level totally overpriced i booked this hotel s lux double room with view to enjoy the view on the eiffel tower for the new year but the truth is that you can see only 1 4 top of the tower as there is a building just in front of it beside this no toothbrush hand soap etc nothing in the bathroom except a cheap hair body gel dispenser 4 stars hotel you said and the breakfast i ve stay in many different kind of hotels but this one is really a 2 stars level buffet breakfast for 18 euros a total joke even if we got it for free as i complained about the view from the bedroom 
 room a bit small for the money
 one member of staff on reception was not very helpful everyone else was superb 
 management was extremely poor 
 nothing
 nothing 
 my room had 2 doors to the balcony it was little bit cold i tried to use ac but it took too long time to heat the room 
 the room was too small opening the bathroom door while i m still on the bed was very annoying especially they have plenty of space to put the bathroom door right after you enter the room they asked me to leave 50 euros deposit you need to walk at least 15 minutes to reach a good area of restaurants and shops
 they weren t particularly helpful when i tried to arrange an early check in
 train s to the airport were not running replacement busses were in place but would have been good if we had known this in advance 
 a c wasn t working very well small windows with no views at least in our room furniture and carpet were slightly worn out
 smell on floor corridor carpets
 the room heating did not respond to adjustments and it was a little on the cool side otherwise an excellent hotel i would return again 
 lighting and noise
 way too small and too many stairs wouldn t recommend to anyone as stairs v steep and dangerous with small kids 
 not being able to contact them direct
 small elevators 
 low ceiling did not take into account my husband being very tall he banged his head when making coffee 
 quite pricey
 the rooms are not as spacious as they seem and the corridors are really narrow 
 the only thing i didn t like was the carpet in the room was a little tired looking 
 hmm let me guess there s nothing 
 lot of street traffic noise
 nothing
 dirty clothes left in the wardrobe in our room also hearing was not working we had to get a blow heater the 2 single beds pushed together instead of a double bed 
 nothing
 no bar restaurant no gym pool 
 size of room was small for what we were used too 
 windows can not be opened 
 kettle was in the cupboard not on table which was a bit inconvenient there was no prices for the cost of breakfast
 absolutely awful i had booked a room for one night for me and my partner as a birthday present on arrival straight away they advised i would have to pay an extra 67 just in case i used other facilities thinking i would receive the money back into my account when i checked out i agreed and carried on with checking in overall the hotel looked lovely until we got into our room it was so cramped and tiny considering i paid for an exclusive double room i felt abit robbed not to mention the view of a horrible roof we then proceeded to try the wifi to them find out it was 10 a day wow in this day and ages this is ridiculous i could understand 5 or something similar later into the night all we heard was slamming doors and construction outside walls almost like paper but i must say the worst part of all was not requesting a wake up call and leaving a do not disturb sign outside somebody just walks into our room at half 9 in the morning looking in and walking back out furious isn t even the word and to top it off the money they took from me will not be back into my account until 5 10 working days talk about false advertisement and awful service i seriously would never recommend anyone to stay here 
 air conditioner shut off at midnight and was very weak 
 the breakfast was quite frugal and i felt it was nt value for money the breakfast area has limited seating capacity and becomes quite a challenge to find a place to sit 
 i paid 250 for the room in february only to find it on the day 200 then to charge me for some crisps out the mini bar a bit much
 the extra amount of money for wifi for different speeds 
 parking is very expensive so booked elsewhere to keep the car 
 tiny bathrooms and dining room for breakfast too crowded open to public as well as house guests 
 rooms are much smaller than they look in website booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc two calls to reception with 20 min wait to get things sorted 
 breakfast would have been nice but not included in price 
 everything
 nothing
 nothing
 bar service was erratic 
 parking is available but takes effort to go in and out 
 biscuits in the room or some sort of vending machine as there was nowhere close by late at night open as it s located in a residential area 
 the cleaning lady doesn t change the bed sheets and i can see that she is not doing a great job
 hotel looks like needing renovation especially recep area corridors and lift
 the mattresses could be a little firmer although that is is a personal choice 
 very poor service for breakfast which was too busy and disorganised top floor restaurant wasn t operating and really poor service for what was available 
 the room in paddington way too small unsuitable wardrobe space shower not ideal as water went everywhere and flooded the whole floor
 i liked everything 
 de kamer was outdated 
 nothing we had a super cheap deal on a room and it was a not yet refurbished room however we liked that room it was very clean and excellent value for money in that location 
 gould breakfast lovely staff 
 beds too small we pulled the mattress off the bed and slept on the floor it was a lot more comfortable then shower door didn t open fully and not enough shampoo etc breakfast was nice but wasn t kept hot enough under lamps so half way through already cold 
 the employees in the counter are soooooo slow 
 i was waiting for a table at the restaurant in the evening the lady at the counter told me to wait whilst she appeared to attend to some other tasks that were clearly more important than showing me to a table 
 the pool was a little small 
 breakfast was really good but still limited for kids 
 the hairdryer bolted to the bathroom wall they never work as efficiently as a portable one 
 we couldn t open the window blackout but didn t matter for one night stay the juice in the breakfast was artificial 
 some of the rooms did not have much natural light and were small the triple rooms we booked were perfect 
 drinks very expensive the roof top bar
 the cleaning of my room happened later in the day after i would come back from sightseeing but they would work around cleaning it when i would leave again 
 nothing
 only one elevator
 the lady who greeted us was a bit grumpy and not particularly welcoming this hotel doesn t have a car park but parking meters outside that you cannot park at for longer than 2 hours be careful of the step outside the room as i fell down it on my way out and hurt my ankle 
 the staff was clueless
 breakfast was well presented but limited in scope air conditioning was aggressive and resulted in rather dry air perhaps some humidification would help 
 they have two wings victoria and another one which has been recently renovated the one i had was not as good as the other
 more lights in our room otherwise lovely 
 small room but didn t spoil our stay at all possible drainage problems smell coming from drain in shower cubicle easily rectified by keeping a towel over plug hole when not in use 
 the staff are not very friendly and make you feel uncomfortable they never offer help on their own i had to take my own bags upstairs the morning reception lad didn t even care as he saw me take my own bags a female staff in the breakfast buffet has told my wife when she took a couple of napkins from the napkin tray why are you taking napkins you already have 1 on your table and my wife had to explain to her that we have an infant with us and we simply need more napkins very rude their omelet was below standard other food was good no complaints there morning room service didn t vacuum the floor as i came back to the room i still could see crumbs on the floor 
 spa treatments booked up complicated tv control 
 i was a little disappointed when i got there to be told i had to move to the hotel across the road and when i got there the room was so small could hardly turn around safe to say we won t be coming back 
 the worst item of this otherwise nice hotel the water pressure was absolutely miserable the staff explained that this was due to holland being flat but surely water towers exist in holland too or failing that standard 1970s plumbing technology allows for the installation of a pressure pump as the hotel purports to be of a high standard it would not hurt to add this little trick to an otherwise excellent experience other remarks no aircondition our rate did not include breakfast the hairdryer was as is often the case of the weak sort the very nice and beatiful modern shower had no curtain or rim on the floor leading to a regular inundation of the whole bathroom floor several coffee shops i e marijuana smoker places are near to the hotel adding a slightly seedy tone to the otherwise nice area 
 the very ordinary overpriced breakfast i also would like a kettle in the room to make a cup of tea 
 tea and coffee facilities we had to hire a kettle we would have loved a balcony especially as roof terrace not open all the time we would have loved the pool on the terrace to have been heated 
 the room was very small but space was well used 
 the room was a little small but nothing big to complain about
 the single room was like a cell with ripped furnishings and a portable aircon which you could not sleep through very thin walls meant i could hear every snore from the next room the bathroom was so tiny that if you were large you would have trouble fitting in included breakfast was a very average continental 
 0 options at breakfast no minibar in the suite
 nothing
 the room was too hot and it was impossible to adjust the temperature and the ventilation system makes a lot of noise particularly noticeable during the night quite pricey but barcelona is becoming increasingly so 4 50 for a beer in the born area 
 sharp hard plastic transparent fire exit signs that hang from the ceiling cut my head immediately on arrival 
 location far
 no kettle in room for a hot drink
 would have liked more coffee for the coffee machine no point buying a large container for one night and some little milk sachets even to buy these for 1 or 2 would be a good option 
 for the cost of the room i feel the breakfast should be included the suite we stayed in only had a thick curtain to pull across to separate the bathroom from the bedroom it would be important to check with the hotel to make sure you are getting what you are expecting 
 size of room for the price i paid air conditioning was noisy and so was the hall way 
 tea and coffee were poor had to go buy our own breakfast wasnt great but was a decent selection not all the lights worked in the room and our blinds were ripped and broken
 no air conditioning no mini bar no opening window room was rather shabby and drab 
 tiny rooms no residents bar
 room carpet was not hovered 
 room quality average could hear noise from corridor room next door and construction nearby 
 hotel is in the middle of an industrial park so you are stuck there for meals unless you go to barcelona staff is very slow often waited 10 mins to be acknowledged at the restaurant or cafeteria sign on ac tells you not to touch it ridiculous as room was consistently very warm and leaving windows open was way too noisy 
 nothing the hotel was excellent 
 restaurant dinner service is very poor waited one hour for an order while 90 percent of restaurant was empty staff indifferent and sloppy hotel room doors need oiling and new closing mechanisms very noisy and annoying 
 100 pounds deposit taken at check in for any expenses that may be charged during your stay when you check out they refund to your card but still not returned after 2 days
 would have expected free car parking considering the cost of the rooms no onsite car parking but there again the hotel is located in a small street therefore parking is at a premium underground car park was a short walk but absolutely fine
 i put my properties inside the safety box which is included 2500 and 1500 euro when i checked out i didn t check my bag based on my trust once i arrived home i saw it is lost 800 and 100 euro i called to the hotel but they said they cant do anything 
 the room was the size of a small cupboard and the bathroom the size of a shoe box a small one you could sit on the loo and wash your feet in the bath at the same time if you are over 6 foot tall and over the age of 60 upgrade to a king size room they ask you when you book in if you want to upgrade the room for 18 per night wish we had you wont get in and out of the shower shower over the bath had to be a contortionist to get in and out the bathroom was not very clean the shampoo bottles had dust on the door had smears on and we found a hair or two on the sink not ours take your own hairdryer at 180 a night i thought at least there will be a good hairdryer and mirror to do my hair in think again the hair dryer was one of those permeant wall mounted ones you used to find in the 1970 s in swimming pool changing rooms and it was situated over the loo i had no control over the power or heat and it went off half way through as it over heated spent my weekend looking like i had put my fingers in an electric socket 
 unfortunately some of the other guests spoiled the dining experience for us as because as it was a buffet meal a lot of people seemed intent on eating as much as they could in a short space of time even though the staff kept refilling the trays of food on one occasion it took only 22 seconds for two large trays of cakes to be devoured i would add that this is not the hotel or staffs fault 
 couldn t check in early
 a little further out from main amsterdam but within walking distance 
 terrible room view no bath limited pillows uncomfortable bed parking too far away had to pay for parking in full as 15 discount voucher given my hotel had expired 31 01 16
 would have liked simpler breakfast or snack options other than restaurant didn t love the breakfast
 very small bathroom
 no kettle 
 its a very old fashioned furniture not everybody s style 
 too white and too many mirror
 nothing i want to live there 
 could hear the noise from other residence who cam back to their rooms late
 size of the room good for one person
 bathroom located in the room separated from the bed by a curtain smell from the restaurant in the halls 
 a miscommunication resulted about my free continental breakfast the wait staff did not explain it properly th toilet was difficult to flush house keeping came at irractically so we had to hang out while it got done a number of times good for the money but some quirks 
 i would have liked to have had tea coffee making facilities in the bedroom 
 outrageous cost of breakfast given the extremely small eating area very limited choice of hot food where trays of scrambled eggs bacon for example were left empty and not replaced by kitchen staff tables left far too long in a dirty condition after people had vacated them and a general lack of organisation throughout the breakfast area 
 no salad and vegetable for breakfast
 scared by the scifi look a cubicle like small room but after getting used to it actually all that you need
 the website didn t do the hotel justice really is excellent 
 the cleanliness in the room was very low they need to improve and also to change some furniture carpet and also some walls were dirty 
 the rooms closer to the lift can hear quite a lot of noises 
 the breakfast area was also the lobby i would have liked a nice lobby to sit in tea sugar and milk not replaced each day in the room as there were tea making facilities 
 parking was a nightmare you have to phone a number when you got to the car park so they could lift the barrier but no answer so i rang the hotels reception to be told i had to walk up to reception as noone would answer the number that was left breakfast was a bit of a sham everything lovely once you finally got it but seemed to be chasing staff constantly to get cutlery juice jams 
 the only negative thing about my stay was the noisy cleaners in the hallway when i had do not disturb sign on there was a staff closet probably supply closet next to my room where they frequently slammed the door and either a mop or a vacuum cleaner kept hitting the walls outside the room not very considerate 
 the line on the breakfast and not variety breakfast food 
 there was nothing to dislike 
 everything was perfect 
 nothing
 you couldn t check in to the room until 4pm however they did hold our luggage 
 all good 
 no coffee or tea facilities in room 
 perhaps a few more sunbeds around the pool area would help
 location not so great but close to bus route 
 choice of taxi firm used by hotel seemed expensive black cabs cheaper and more respectful 
 lift fruits
 the fold up bed not good at all and there was a radio play all night and the under ground train was under our room was awake most of the night at first i thought it was the laundrette of the hotel and staff had the radio on and it was the washing machine spinning ha but on the second night my friend had found out what it was 
 was looking forward to sitting on the roof top bar and seeing the views but only for private functions looking forward to the night club but was closed staff where lacking in knowledge of drinks not knowing what cider was room was not made up during the day overall for a 5 hotel poor advertisement of facilities and very expensive for the service we received 
 nothing
 the breakfast was poor there were hot dishes for fruit salad and cold plates for the hot cold food stayed here a few times before but the breakfast was poor this time and we paid 24 pounds for it 
 car parking is a 5 minutes walk
 asked for bathrobes to be delivered as they weren t in the wardrobe didn t arrive 
 the hotel was very busy and consequently the wait for lifts and check in out was longer than we expected 
 wifi poor wouldnt connect
 the room was too small even we had upgraded the mirror inside the cupboard was broken and the amount of dust not clean behind and top of the tv was not cleaned for a very long time the cables behind the tv had so much covered in dust 
 there was no plug in the bathroom 
 nothing 
 reception staff rude and unhelpful
 restaurant wasn t as nice as i expected not brilliant atmosphere very empty and dark i loved my meal but my other 4 friends didn t
 old furniture old equipment in the room and bathroom 
 everything was perfect 
 not cheap but maybe you get what you pay for 
 room is just too small
 rooms are not much different to a travelodge except they are smaller they took the payment out of the wrong account i rang up 3 times and was told that they would contact me back they didn t so i was then told to send an email i did and no reply so disappointed with the customer service after leaving a member of staff walked into my room whilst i was changing at the time i didnt mind but this along with the poor customer service has made me not want to stay again 
 value of money very far from the city and no english movie chanel 
 food wasn t really good through my online booking i asked for non smoking room in upper level floor and i get non of this as they game me smoking room in first floor the view of my room was the celling of the entrance block so there wasn t street view as they said
 small bed maybe according to the type of the room hairdryer placed in the room hidden and fixed in the drawer missing a toilet brush 
 wish it would ve been warmer so we could use the roof but obviously that s not in the hotel s control 
 nothing for us although some building work going on but did not impact on us but depending where your room is coulocated impact
 bartender was very friendly looked after us so big plus only one but the cocktails are pricey and werent good value for money maybe bar staff needs a little training update 
 dissappointed no one replaced burned out bulb outside room2236 after i reported 2 times breakfast buffet was near bad would be happy to discuss with you need more staff to support breakfast rush 22d floor ice machine broken 
 poor quality mattress and pillows 
 gave me wrong wifi code
 a bit far from the nearest metro station the washing room facility seems a bit dated and dirty
 wifi isn t free 
 food in the restaurant was a little pricey 
 being charged for a complimentary breakfast
 it s a pity the executive lounge hours for an alcoholic drink are limited 6 8 pm non alcoholic drinks and small snacks are however always available 
 breakfast was extra 
 the staff were very unhelpful at reception they did not explain properly why they were taking 50 from my card in fact the lady did not even tell me it would go out of my bank they seemed very miserable not great customer service the lighting in the bedroom was poor quite dull 
 the restaurant cafe americain we were unlucky with our meals did not like the prawns on ice as a starter warm underbaked halfraw prawns in their baking oily skin on a pile of ice resulted in a lukewarm watery mix of undistinct brown colour no fingerbowl the restaurant is pricy and we had been looking forward to a good dinner in a great historic place disappointing 
 the windows in the room are like plastic so all the smokers outside the bars in the street you can hear absolutely everything till the wee hours of the morning a party was on above my room till 11 30pm nothing anyone could do but the team gave me a free breaky so was a nice gesture for no sleep 
 room was lovely but the bed was very hard 
 room was right next to the 24hour in hotel guest laundry very very noisy due to people talking and laughing waiting for their clothes to be done ask for a room far far away 
 the beds was a bit to hard and having these super thin pillows was also a bit of a pain it does make me appreciate my own bed more 
 rooms tiny
 room didnt have a bath room was very small unlike the pictures 
 needs to increase the breakfast space 
 n a
 it was expensive compared to other holiday inn s worldwide but i guess that s due to the location london
 rooms a bit dated but clean
 annoying staff at 8 am they were cleaning the other rooms on the floor in a very noisy way and didn t stop even once i ve told them i was trying to sleep in addition the receptionist were of no help at all i had to book a taxi by my own since they weren t able to call the agency so disappointed and it was also very expensive 
 no bath 
 4 nights wasn t long enough 
 didn t feel that welcoming we waited ages to be served with tea or coffee at breakfast then had to ask then got it wrong the head waiter did sort out without any fuss the fact we thought breakfast was included but wasn t which was very good of him we simply paid upon finishing 
 room small
 restaurant was packed with a japenese coach tour
 nothing
 very old fashioned rooms that need updating 
 nothing was to our dislike
 the breakfast was poor
 no elevator not easy access
 we booked for a room with a double bed they attached two single beds and made it look as a double bed 
 the only con is the fact that the hotel is right on the corner of a relatively busy junction light sleepers might find the noise of traffic disturbing 
 25 minute wait to check in just after 16 00 
 at their price tag internet connection should be free of charge for guests staying more than a day 
 the shower head needs changing and the regulating device for hot and cold is very tricky it is an old building so the sound proofing is not so good but that is to be expected in a conversion 
 room was very small and positioning of the bed under the window was not great could do with updating
 warmfull staff clean and enjoy stay 
 when we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was a bit too friendly and asked my boyfriend to carry the bags in the room by himself which is very bad we are a young couple however we re used to attend 5 hotels and this never happened anywhere else before i think this should not happen as it s a minimum service to carry the luggage and show us the room when we arrived in the room we where suprised because there was a wall right in front of our window with a man smoking his cigarette and looking at us no intimicy of course we asked to change the room immediatly and we were offered another room which was fine according to me the staff should anticipate more the client s needs especially if you pretend to be a 5 hotel in addition the rooms are not isolated which means that you litterally hear the other clients flushing the toilet 
 room was super small
 the breakfast is poor in offer of products
 being woken at 8 40am after a late night out by an angle grinder hammering and drilling was more than unnecessary on a sunday morning that spoiled a very enjoyable stay not what you expect for 229 
 wi fi hit and miss 
 may be a closet in the room
 high price and breakfast was not included
 elevated waiting
 room 301 a bit restricted in space the large chair by the dressing table need to be a little smaller and manageable the toilet roll holder a bit of a reach 
 rooms are very small and don t look anything like the pictures portrayed on booking com 
 no tea or coffee making facilities use of iron ironing board not available it is a 4 star and these comforts should be available in a 4 star we had travelled a long way and use of an iron would have been convenient 
 the air conditioner doesn t cool enough and front desk staffs doesn t so friendly and helpful i was informed them to send thing to my room and they sent to another room and don t know how to get it back terrible 
 room a bit small
 shuttle service inconvenient an occasion in particular which the reception staff are aware off apparently it had broken down which we were told and had to walk from the station at 11pm at night and the staff in the morning said t was completely fine weird we called at 10 20 making sure we could get the 11oclock shuttle and we were assured yes we could but in the end it wasn t there service with a smile would ve been nice along with more knowledgable staff 
 what i didn t like is that when i did the reservation and got there they told me that the breakfast was included but then they told me that i had to pay for each breakfast which was too much that s very unacceptable by telling me that the breakfast was included but somehow it wasn t there was no room view and the bathroom is very uncomfortable 
 our booking wasn t confirmed in thier system
 nothing really 
 wifi signal was very poor i don t get signal to the room difficult to go with public transport because hotel is on hill and difficult to walk from metro stop be ready to walk 0 5 km within hotel to reach your room 
 the front desk wasn t very helpful but the staff in the restaurant were nice 
 wi fi is really slow basic option is not enough to work with mail and surfing you have to pay 10 euros to get better internet also elevators were too slow 
 club breakfast
 this is not a 5 star hotel maybe in 1986 expensive very dated rooms and as for the bathroom i couldnt believe how small it was 
 there were a couple of false alarm in the middle of the night which may not be of hotel s fault a better insolated double window would make the room a five star one
 bit too close together at breakfast time 
 the room was not the same as on the site the room is very very small at the floor 8 you hit the wall the room smelt strongly a tabacco air conditioner dripped all night
 the room was in a separate small area that at the beginning was locked with a door so i had to go downstairs again and ask for the key in the end the key was on top of the room key only 1 towel in the whole room tv was not already prepared so no channels available wireless password was needed but not communicated upfront by the reception 
 nothing 
 housekeeping could have removed used cups from day before
 nothing to report
 breakfast pricey very small scratch that tiny gym 
 the walls were not sound proof and you could hear any small noise from the other rooms like when they used the bath room this was a bit inconvenient at night 
 the bathroom door would not provide enough privacy 
 i don t know why i ve been stayed here only for 3 nights but the hotel deduct 4 nights fee from my account and 4 nights tax 
 price a bit over the rest of hotels in the ares
 rooms are very small no drawers and small closet 
 no gym
 i thought the mattress was to hard 
 after the recent change of the staff at breakfast area the service level decreased and sometimes it went to pure chaos 
 there is no restaurant in the hotel to eat dinner
 pool restaurant short of staff had to wait for same guy doing room service to get anything
 nothing 
 not much parking facilities
 the room used to have alot of dust everyday maybe its the parquet flooring but would feel not clean enough 
 i have asked for drop off and remind reception staff at 11 pm my flight was 4 am and driver didn t show up and staff at reception had no clue but they were kind enough to arrange taxi 
 although the room has a modern design wear is evident the cleaning was not through when i first arrived at the room for instance there was red stuff on the bathtub floor and water stains on the shower knobs the walls were dented with black lines and there was a huge stain on the sofa cushion i thought these imperfections would be corrected the second day s room cleaning but during the 8 hours i m not in the room there was no housekeeping service 
 the towels were rough and thin and the complimentary toiletries were meagre eg no cotton wool balls and low quality tissues and toilet paper
 to be selfish a bar on the roof next to the pool would have been top 
 shower setup conventional shower setup would be adequate 
 nothing
 did not like that the hotel is a smoking hotel we travel a month every year all over europe have never encountered a smoking hotel i believe booking should note this on their reservation site the hotel has non smoking floors and we might of gone for that the problem is when there is smoke it travels to the other floors i am highly allergic they did change our room the last night due to a cancellation which i really appreciated 
 ensureing that late night revellers at 3am keep quiet as they are returning to their rooms
 no towelling robe gym poor but i was lucky and went when empty need a stepper
 the fact we didn t stay longer 
 some staff is not as kind as they should my door was knocked at 9 am to be told to get ready to leave on my check out day 
 no wifi even tho we complained a number of times at reception booked a view room which we had only if you stood at the window couldn t see view if you were in bed or sat at the window breakfast was awful the wait the service was really disappointing ordered 2 veg options only 1 ever turned up shocking lift well where do i start it was not exceptible for a hotel to run the way you do and charge the prices you do for such poor service 
 bolting two single beds together does not make a great king bed the two mattresses kept separating which was the only blot on the place 
 room a bit small short bed 
 it states the wifi works ever where but my self and my friend had a lot off difficulty getting connected and using it on the 2nd floor especially in our room if we wanted to use wifi we had to go to we re the food is served to sit although we found it worked perfect everywhere else we did find it disconnected it s self a number of times so we had to constantly ask for the wifi password as it is different each time i also found on the website it states a price you pay at hotel once we arrived we didn t it until the end and it was 20 extra which was for the cleaning of the room and bedroom tax which i thought it should ve been inclusive in the price as it doesn t state anything on the booking confirmation 
 there was a sign that charged for the coffees with breakfast which we though was a bit off as we booked b b but it turns out it had been left out and they removed it just as we had finished and started leaving the restaurant
 would have liked a business centre but the reception was more than helpful in printing what i needed 
 needs a bit up date with furniture 
 no supermarkets or restaurants nearby 
 50 extra added to the room bill in case of any damage i wasn t aware of this but understand the policy reimbursed once you check out so this is knitt picking 
 asked for 1 double bed but was given 2 singles
 didn t consider it value for money 200 pp didn t even include breakfast had to pay extra for a swim which i wasn t aware of until i arrived unfortunately on arrival internet didn t work and neither did tv 
 due to heavy traffic in front of the building a bit noisy definetly needed ear plugs for sleeping
 nothing that i did not like
 room was quite small but made up for by great central location of hotel
 bedding wasn t as soft as i like
 noise due to construction near by
 we stayed at first floor and there was an unbearable bad smell when you opened the window 
 a bit pricey should have included breakfast for the price it would have been nice to have an electric kettle in the room 
 the bath rooms were so small two people could literally not fit in them and little things like mugs in rooms were rarely placed there
 room was so hot even with the window open the shower didn t work only one teabag in the room so had to ask for more which the start were quick to resolve 
 great rainshower but rather small bathroom the spa area was not free for customers 
 location
 little bit too hot
 staff quite rude and unhelpful ripped me off on a second night stay booked the first night on booking then needed to extend another night and seriously increased the price then i was sat in the lobby area and overheard somebody walk in and book there and then much cheaper complained about this and they said they couldn t do anything as the rate fluctuates not a good way to make somebody want to come again rooms a bit on the small size
 the fact you couldn t actually get out of the building without your key card annoying if it didn t work and kept having to go back to reception 
 it said free spa facilities but that was for only 1 hour a day which we were not told till we wanted to use them so had to pay 10 each 
 no lock on the bathroom door and no door in the shower so floor was very wet and slippery after each shower 
 the facilities are not quite up to standard and are old similar to most holiday inns definitely not good value for money
 breakfast service very slow understaffed no plates available very limited choice from the breakfast bar the swimming pool was not in operation during the 3 days we stayed in this hotel no explanation was given just bad service without excuses from the staff the train connection thameslink did not run at all during 25 26 and 27th of december the hotel staff was not aware our planned connection from luton airport to the hotel did not work for that reason it took finally about 1 hour longer then it was said 
 with a 11 year old the metro is just a bit far away but hey i could have figured that out up front 
 lancaster gate tube station is closed for maintenance until july 2017 so that made the hotel slightly less accessible but it is still only a short walk from paddington 
 sky rocketing room price during the milan fashion week 
 the disco at the weekend security on the door nowhere quiet to go after a long hard day of work very expensive with 12 5 added to every single thing you purchase see through toilet doors in some rooms and a mouse seen running around in the dining room at night 
 room was small and was without windows natural sunlight 
 nothing
 not a huge fan of pre cooked breakfast ordinary cooked to order specialities scrambled egg and smoked salmon for example better 
 everything else terrible servive overall poor facilities in general
 a very tired and cold room also not particularly clean 
 no breakfast offered with the booking ac in my room wasn t working and though we have complained it wasn t fixed if you choose this hotel to stay make sure they do not give you room 502 ac is not working in that room
 room was a little on the small side for four people 
 would have liked a bigger gym pool small but it was in the centre of the city a bit of noise from the street below in the early hours we were on the third floor 
 quiet area and not in the city centre
 the bed seamed a little on the small side feet kept sticking out the bottom 
 we found the bed to be very firm and rather uncomfortable 
 feel bathrooms could do with updating
 the reviews didn t match at all with what the reality is we moved after only one night spent there 
 the rooftop pool area was a little uncomfortable no lounges cabanas very uncomfortable seating and this is where we encountered staff not up to standard of other hotel staff 
 wi fi wouldn t work even with effort of staff
 hotel is located in an area that is somewhat run down and not necessarily breathes the atmosphere of a friendly environment 
 breakfast all self service apart from tea coffee ran out of bread for the toaster and had to wait a while for more a bit of a bun fight 
 price
 one of the rooms did not have a bath tub other two did paid the same for all three 
 nothing
 no early check in even though i am a regular customer i waited 5 hours for my room and was told it probably wouldn t be ready by check in time i won t be coming back i need a hotel i can get into by noon when flying all night from us 
 room up in price think this is widespread in barcelona very slow to clean and make up our room on the last day not so bad other days not too easy to control room temperature in a heat wave 
 the cleanes as we found a big rat at the room
 the fact that we had a room on the street which was noisy in the early hours next time we will request a room off the street 
 size of the room
 very bad 24 hours room service extremely noisy bed 
 noise from maintenance work that was going on
 parking fee could not be paid with amex
 the location was a little far out for us but that s our fault 
 no complaints
 the dark old carpet in the room no effective ventilation in bathroom room not well lit pink colord room door
 no fridge to keep bottled water cold it was very hot this weekend
 poor customer service
 the picture on the web page did not up to the room we got bed was against the wall so had to clamber over or down the bed to get out shareing as a couple
 my room m5 was terrible no lift access to this room 2 flights of stairs i could hear the noise of the water pipe all night seriously 
 the bed is uncomfortable 
 the floor in our bathroom disabled access wet room didn t have the best drainage so would flood
 bacon undercooked at breakfast
 a bit pricey maybe
 no iron in room you have to pay to get your clothes ironed no tea and coffee facilities in room 
 housekeeping is average
 everything was good
 while the cafe is lovely i m not a big fan of buffets and theirs was very british so would have preferred an a la carte service for breakie i ended up going round the corner to table which was excellent for breakie each morning 
 the bathroom was dirty and breakfast really isn t value for money and checkout was a little manic 
 nothing
 room was small for the price
 construction in front of the building blocks taxi access struggled with my luggage as the taxi drops me far from the hotel due to road block
 limited facilities but it is a small hotel noise from the room above bathroom fan not working so slight smell of damp 
 road noise at front of property depends on what you are used to though 
 no comment
 the room was mostly clean but there was some mold in the grouting in the shower and one of the bed side tables had been moved forward and there was lots of dust behind it 
 they gave only one set of towel suddenly for one day usually two sets no traveler s information at all map etc in the restaurant for breakfast queue management was not good and tables were dirty and sticky 
 fat from metro station
 the manager has got a attitude she need to learn how to talk to guests she was so rude i could have made a big deal of a issue but couldn t be bothered to talk to the manager that is the only down fall of the hotel the other receptionist was good but they didn t realy welcome the guest as they should no morning no afternoon
 room was small
 location not quite as close to beach as name suggests 
 nothing
 bar not great impersonal clinical
 the elevator is very small no reat room at the lobby
 the breakfast place is nice and cosy and there were variations but i would suggest more eggs choices instead of the crumbled only but thats just me being picky hehe
 bottled beer was slightly pricey
 very small room
 too busy for the facilities reception bar etc too many non hotel people gatecrashing hotel facilities had to wait 35 mins to be served a drink in eclipse bar
 overpriced
 loud fan and it was dripping in bathroom
 every thing was great
 must book the executive room and above for a normal hotel experience ie normal bathrooms 
 underground sound all night 
 toilet area was very cramped
 the view from our bedroom
 the hotel is new so they do not yet have a bar or dining area for the evening however these are not essential and didn t detract from our stay the cleaners come at around 3pm which was often when we wanted to come back and rest before the evening but again not a huge problem as they were quick and usually done within 15 minutes it would have been nice to have a mirror in the main room not just the bathroom 
 nothing
 i m a chronic traveler i barely stay in one place and im also very cretical too as i go to a lot of hotels and i always demand no mistakes honestly this hotel is more and beyond perfect the pictures on the website look amazing when you reach the hotel you realize that the pic didnnot guve justice the reality of the hotel and the room is more beatiful cleaner quiter and the smell and the interior is just too good i never do that but i took pics and sent to my family and friends the staff is very proffecianal kind helful freindly and super involved in your matters in a super way i want to mention 3 names on the fron disk hussein at te night shift and the 2 amazing girls during the day natasha and melony what an amazing experuence in paris seriously its really something to remember and talk about as an example thank you 
 not didn t like but it would of been nice to have a bath in the room very small point
 the room was at the back and at night was very noisy room for 3 needs to have all items for 3 such as 3 glasses teacups etc 
 i paid extra for a 6th floor room to have a balcony the handle was broken on the balcony door and the staff seemed a bit indifferent and had i not pushed they would have gladly seen me stay in the room with no access in the end they moved me to a new room after one night but did not offer any compensation for the first night the shower flooded and despite letting front desk staff know they never fixed it so every morning i threw every towel in the room on the floor so try to prevent the hardwood from being destroyed on checkout they did not put on the mini bar charges i had but did charge a hotel bar change to my bill that was not mine in the end they comped the mini bar and i am waiting for a credit on my credit card for the bar charge 
 not impressed that it s was 10 to park your car as a guest why should guests of the hotel have to pay when the purpose of a hotel is your away from home and the majority of the time travelled there by own car but then just because there was an event on at wembley the parking jumped to 25 that s a disgrace 
 english breakfast not worth the extra 5 50 per person bathroom could have been cleaner shower door did not close completely 
 the decor is looking very tired and dated it being a busy hotel we felt it should be maintained more often
 bad case of damp carpet smell which was very overpowering also the stafff asked me to pay for a service i didn t use 
 air condition is very old and rather hot due to window is locked gym is small and lack of gym equipment but pool is nice even it s much mini
 staff not the most friendly i ordered the times and never got it either day the breakfast was average for a 5 
 a tad basic was expecting a bit more style 
 basic facilities around room service in house would have been ideal they did a room service menu but i think it was food delivered from restaurants outside 
 staff not really helpful
 location it took 27 minutes to get to terminal 4 i took 11 2 hours to get to hotel from downtown london
 rooms are very small 
 bathroom 
 too expensive dark corridors in my part of the building there was only one small lift covering 4 floors 
 nothing
 we had prepaid we believed fully through booking com and were presented with a bill for 168 69 euros on check out the city tax accounted for 30 euros of that the staff were unable to explain the balance we paid because we were in a hurry to catch a train but it left a sour taste 
 i would have liked to have had a bath tub in our bathroom incredibly the shops were closed on both saturday and sunday because of a festival
 awful experience in the restaurant staff member was rude and didn t seem to want to serve us also food was not worth the money my pasta tasted like salt mentioned this on check out and staff on reception said it is not run by the hotel i would advice not to go 
 the noise from the street but hi they give you earplugs 
 we were upgraded fine but the room has seen better days and the fabric lining everywhere on the walls helped to leave the room with a nicotine legacy from when there was no smoking policy ie a long time ago it needs refurbishing
 housekeeping not up to standard 
 bit pricey
 bar a bit pricey
 n a
 nothing
 stuff
 bad internet connection
 i ve stayed here twice last time we got turntables or guitars in the bedroom this time that was absent which was a shame the little details are what make hotels special which is why we wanted to stay here also the room wasn t ready by 3 00 and we had to hang around which was a little disappointing 
 shower small bed 4 6 double noise from window room next to lift chipped sink stained sink
 perfect very good
 the room could ve been just a little bigger and i would ve preferred the sink to be actually inside the bathroom 
 i felt i am on business trip rather than leisure one room i got was too noisy could not sleep easy 
 lack of toiletries and tissues in room so can only award 3 star s 
 the pillows could have been better
 it will be nice when the furniture up grades are completed
 book a taxi was the worst mistake and what gave to hotel a bad rating on my behalf what possessed the concierge to charge me 5 euro to book a taxi book 
 room was not comfortable enough the bed was so small for two there was not enough closets to place the clothes toilet looks very old need renovation 
 very expensive parking counting per started day so 2 nights are 3 days times 20 eur far too expensive 
 the restaurant dinner menu was very limited and needs more variety food we wanted was not available
 originally booked twin beds but as booking com did not send through my exact booking i ended up sleeping on a sofa bed which unfortunately i did not find comfortable whatsoever but the bed my son slept in was lovely and comfortable a complaint had been lodged with the booking company
 in booking written that there are three single beds in the room but it s not true even if the hotel style is classic the furniture need to be changed the last thing i don t like the housekeeping doesn t reflect 5 stars hotel but it doesn t mean that the room it s not clean also the should change the system of old keys to cards it s not comfortable and not right to use a key in this century
 nothing
 excessive price of breakfast
 tiny room broken shower and light and water was only warm in shower after 9pm only 1 plug out of 4 in the room worked needs a lot of work 
 locattion
 some of junior suits have stairs in it
 n a
 bed was a tad firm
 breakfast is terrible room damp and bad smell location is average wifi poor 
 there s nothing that i didn t like 
 breakfast finished 10 30 am
 charge for early check in even though they advised we could check in if room ready given wrong room complained and manager rude have written letter to hotel 
 reception never answers phone calls from the room irons are not automatically put in rooms and its first come first serve iron also has the shortest of cable which can t reach to the end of the board and the board is an odd shape 
 not in walking distance to city center somewhat expensive 
 we slept on the side where there was a square so at night it was not really quiet as people were sitting on terraces people making music that was the only negative thing 
 small rooms 
 some of the idiots frequenting the place on a match day zero tolerance policy needed as some residents suffered due to so called rugby fans
 small bathroom toilet corner is so small that you have to sit to the side dont use shower gel and shampoo that is in the bathroom its weird oily and i could not clean myself with water properly or the water is bad 
 rooms are not soundproof you can hear in the hallway but other wise the area was very quiet 
 u should offer us fried or egg omellete on your breakfast
 maybe there should be a minibar all of its rooms 
 no coffe machine in the suite there is school so annoying
 we had problem with electricity in room 244 which resulted in us being unable to charge phones also while working out monies between my friends they charged fee to credit card given within booking when i had not agreed to this felt we were being rushed 
 the room was on a basement room without much light and worst was the bed really uncomfortable mattress the bed was one of these beds that come out of a closet and you have the feeling your head is inside the closet when you sleep not a good experience at all
 n a would rebook in zlondon or elsewhere
 the rooms are very small and look like converted prison cells we had a free upgrade to a deluxe room so i wouldnt have wanted a standard room if the deluxe was as small as it was but as only for an overnight stay it was acceptable 
 the bathroom and the toilet do not have a ventilation fan i had to pay extra 15euros to use the gym in the hotel 
 if you re a light sleeper probably ask to not have a room at the front of hotel passing trams can occasionally disturb the restaurant is a bit dark and having catwalk videos playing is a bit much at breakfast 
 none
 booked twin got double
 mould on our toast in the morning however when we told staff they were mortified they reported it to the manager ans they all continually apologised throughout the stay the manager gave us a free upgrade to a cooked breakfast the next day which was much appreciated and not asked for hence good rating below 
 rooms were very poor inc bathroom for price that we paid 
 the only thing i would have liked is if breakfast was included the hotel is very lovely but for the price we paid i wouldve liked a brekkie thrown in 
 i dident like because in booking we reserve arrom from pics when i arrive they told me is just a general pics for all room i dident like it was very cold in room the heat dident work also i dident like they take me more money from credit card and like i deal whit booking and when i go they ask me another 9 euro for tax visit but they already take me money when i arrive the staff dont whana understand you
 i thoroughly enjoyed my stay nothing to change
 our first room was horrible really really small and was i think in the middle of the hotel had one small window overlooking the ceiling of the hotel but we went back down to reception and luckily got a much nicer room 
 nothing
 check was slow taking over half an hour service at the bar on saturday night took forever as only two staff on 
 it s letl bet noise
 location could have been a little bit better but this is very nit picking it was a couple of 100m to the nearest u bahn hub 
 the restaurant used for breakfast is too small actually we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table 
 looks a bit old fashioned 
 poor room location being on the basement and below ground level so didn t have much of a view difficult to communicate with staff seemed to be due to a lanuage barrier 
 the bed was rock hard me and my partner hardly slept or got any rest during the night 
 the room was cold despite turning up the heating the windows didn t fit properly so the wind whistled through the bathroom had no heater so was very cold and the room was very noisy being next to the external air con which rumbled on all night 
 there was nothing not to like 
 we didn t have breakfast included as we found this to be quite expensive however i realise this is not unusual the breakfast room looked nice however we can t comment on the food we found a pret a manger just around the corner which was perfect 
 was rather warm at times within the hotel room there was air conditioning but i found it still not able to get as cool as i like it but that s down to my personal preference so we won t mark them down for that one 
 room a bit on the small side pillows were uncomfortable breakfast was terrible not worth 25 euros per person recommend to eat breakfast at a caf 
 the style of the hotel is in a charming mode we loved it for our personal occasion and it was great though it is different from a trendy place 
 there was nothing i didn t like the location could be better but thats just a personal thing 
 breakfast is a bit expensive 
 staff not quite alert or interested all the time very little hanging space in room and bathroom
 lift broke down twice 
 cleaner overlooked the soap tray in the shower had to clean it myself just an oversight 
 the room was very tight for space 
 the coffee
 very loud room old and noisy water system
 nothing
 staff the concierge mehdi was very rude to us and wasn t helpful at all 
 room wasn t available at advertised check in time
 only one bottle of shampoo and body wash in the shower so felt this only catered for one person staying at the hotel no toothpaste but asked room service and this was brought to the room so clearly do stick this just did not put in the room 
 one spa girl appeared to be always in a bad mood mabe she was just having a bad weekend 
 nothing
 great staff and in particular daphne she supported me through out the stay with tips like places to dine sight seeing and stuff 
 it s excellent
 poor welcome at the reception delayed check in due to room unavailability room settled for one person while booking was for two 
 problems with card for elevator
 limited facilities no resturant breakfast is average hardly any vegetarian options no kettle and tea in the room but what do you expect for the money bit far out 
 the room was very noisy i don t think they have good sound proofing as i could hear the people in the rooms both above and next to me 
 the weather so many british visitors they must have brought their weather to ams 
 nothing
 might be slight change in breakfast menu if not everyday but alternately 
 room very small one small window so little light and had to keep curtains closed as overlooked by an office block drawer handle on dressing table loose so i fixed with my swiss army knife hair in bed and shower had to wait long time for breakfast to be served then coffee luke warm no butter at nearly 20 breakfast exorbitantly priced for very less than average fayre it was probably in the small print but overpriced cocktails in bar had a service charge too that i only knew about when i came to pay bill on leaving one small bar of nut chocolate from room fridge was 5 50 
 only suggestion for improvement was at breakfast staff standards were not the same seen at reception and other areas service was slow and items of our order forgotten toast turned up at the table when we had finished our breakfast
 nos cobraron por un upgrade que no era tal 
 room in need of a good refurbishment fittings were broken aircon noisy bathroom dirty 
 long wait for cooked breakfast and room was very dark with no bath
 there were three of us in the room and friend of mine was arriving later once she was at the reception she stated my name i was making the booking and hers in order to get the key and room number the staff member told her that there are no quests under this name and was quite rude after calling me numerous time i was at the spa she received the key i must stay the lady on check out was very friendly though 
 we had to move rooms because despite having the air con on full for the night the inside room temperature was 26 degrees celsius unbearable so moved rooms at 7am the kettle in the room didn t work room service breakfast was cold and inedible and was removed from the bill after we complained two glasses of orange juice cost us 7 80 all the problems were dealt with by the helpful staff but meant that during a one night stay we were constantly on the move going to or calling reception not the romantic night away we had been looking forward to for our anniversary 
 more veggie food for evening meal and room service 
 the heater and the window insulation was inadequate to bring the temperature warm inside the room and it was uncomfortably cold in the room especially early in the morning it is far from the tourist central and the public transport station is far for asian standard to walk and no one else is around while you walk from the public bus or tram station to the hotel for 30 to 45 minutes after 8 pm i dont recommend this place to anyou tourist 
 the room was very small for the price we paid 
 booking in process poor and we had someone else trying to get into our room due to an error by reception
 it was bad experience to stay this hotel when i first entered this hotel the woman staff who were wearing glasses didn t say hi or hello no greetings after when i was writting down registration card that woman staff hurry me to finish to complete card i was so offended that she doesn t respect asian guest in addition i uses to stay in the hotel all around the world and previous hotels never ask me to pay a hotel bill beforehand however that woman staff hurry me again to pay a hotel bill according to the policy i don t have any duty to pay it beforehand suddenly i felt woman staff is racist it was extremly awful to stay here it was waste of my money i was so humiliated and offensed 
 small elevator 
 the room on the first night was awful blocked shower old creaky bed a broken tv very disappointing for price
 size of bathroom bath too small to have a shower bar had an excellent ambience with several choice of alcohol however service by waitresses was poor 
 you pay for every little thing
 put in a request for upper floor room but arrived and it was available yet i was checked into ground floor just takes up time waiting around when you ve ore filled special request at time of booking
 lights not working in room tv not working reported but not sorted but as it was only an overnight stay didn t chase up though disappointed when returned to room after attending corporate event in mayfair 
 price of breakfast ridiculous
 nothing that would warrant a mention on a review 
 the lift didn t work properly and the room was quite small 
 n a
 bit noisy next to lifts
 room was only made up for 1 person and no mineral water this was soon corrected when reported to reception
 the room was dirty and smelled damp and musty the white lace curtains were grey and dirty a very sad experience for my stay
 food not up to expectations and not all delivered to room
 the room was lovely but the beds a little hard for my liking 
 room was a little too warm as too early in the year for air con
 some staff were very good other cared not about service pot luck which ones you found bar often closed 45 minutes earlier than advertised by disinterested staff when a fellow guest wanted to complain about an unrelated small matter the owner of the hotel denied who he was 
 tiles in bathroom shower had very old black grout needs updating
 there was no fitness center in the hotel
 slight noise from refrigerated unit at 8 00am outside room better to take advantage of bus service rather than tube 
 the choice of facilities provided
 tiny room uncomfortable bed
 really bad location
 there was no wifi reception in my room at all despite the promise on booking com the staff claimed it was a temporary problem but as a matter of fact wifi coverage doesn t cover all the rooms and if yours is further down the corridor you won t get the signal since i was on a business trip that was a real dealbreaker and it goes without saying that the hotel refused to give me a different room with working wireless internet the room was rather tidy yet it definitely needed a renovation in certain areas power outlets were rather wobbly and tended to follow the plug when i pulled it out flush buttons in the restroom also were not properly secured in the wall finally the hotel froze the full amount of money for my stay on my credit card four days before i even arrived despite the fact that the free cancellation was until one day before arrival and the money were released only after two weeks so for a period of time i was effectively double charged to summarize i would not recommend this hotel there are much cheaper and better offers in the area 
 at breakfast in the club lounge on sunday and monday was a little disappointing firstly the member of staff was a bit abrupt and we had to ask for hot drinks also there were no yoghurt and considering this was a continental breakfast i found that a little upsettin 
 the room was small but to be expected for london had everything you needed 
 parking space 
 the room was too dark it could have done with a table lamp for reading 
 low ceilings labyrinth very old building need urgent investments not a 5 stars according to me
 noise levels high due to building work that said i was offered a quieter inner facing room this however was quite day due to scaffolding over the top of the hotel 
 facilities needs updating form room to parking space
 small room but it s not a big problem 
 parking was very expensive for registered guests parking should be much lower than 25 euro per day 
 unfortunately the pool was not heated 
 coming from asia i would expect complimentary bottled water that is available in the room in addition a kettle together with complementary coffee or tea we had to book 3 rooms as their max capacity is 2 pax and we had a party of 5 even though they gave us a free upgrade to a deluxe room i could not find the nespresso machine that was promised as i was only there for 1 night i decided not to pursue it 
 room was a little small but nothing out of the ordinary for inner city hotel
 wasn t the biggest room and bathroom was a little old dusty
 the room bed bathroom were a lot smaller than expected the room was also very dark the bath plughole was broken tv remote was not working batteries lights were hard to turn off 
 dirty bed sheets when we arrived and dirty towels
 could have been a book giving information e g check out times and meal times also no food available in bar or restaurant after 10 30 hard luck if you have been to the theatre 
 small room size
 wooden window blinds left a lot of light seep in from the street deluxe room was booked which offered views of the square we got views of a construction site
 terrible staff had no idea of basics in hospitality every member of staff gives you a different answers for the same question leaking in the bathroom extremely small rooms especially for 2 people not worth what is charged at all 
 better hot breakfast selection
 no toilets on ground floor no mirror where hairdryer was fixed in drawer pop up waste in bath did not pop up had to remove fan didn t work in bathroom and 10 service charged applied at bar without being advised first 
 nothing
 room was bad and depressing and there are no windows small and uncomfortable bed
 rooms are not big
 the room was not ready on arrival constant noise of some machinery couldn t sleep properly 
 for this amount of money paid for a night would be reasonable to have a breakfast included additional price of 19euro person 19 euros parking 8 euro internet fee is charging the whole accommodation with additional 50 missing beauty kit in the bath
 the lady who checked us in on oct 23 was not very kind and welcome bad impression the hotel qualifies for 3 star not 4 the rooms are small though we booked double rooms for single use there was a bad smell in the room on the first night 
 just a small thing would have liked to have been able to have toast rather than croissant danish pastry as a continental breakfast option 
 it would be possible to renew the shower
 nothing
 the lack of leisure facilities 
 the veiws was terrible 
 the staff were quite rude and icy on arrival it was difficult to understand the receptionist checking us in the bed was not made until the evening time we were requested to pay 3 nights accommodation despite staying two nights and that the extra nights fee would be returned to me within a few days not great if you had a certain weekend budget 
 room was small and dark only had a few recessed lights 
 the hallways need better lighting 
 nothing 
 would have preferred shower separate to bath also balcony door was locked 
 only one small problem i needed to telephone my bank in the u s making a collect or reverse charges call but the hotel told me that their charges for the call would be 2 pounds per minute for a call which from previous experience could easily last 10 minutes that was really unhelpful 
 location a litlle bit but tram station isnt far
 coffee served at breakfast wasn t the best
 no slippers were provided in the room 
 rooms are very stuffy even with windows open suggestion would be to add air con
 n a
 late check in as room wasn t ready
 loved the room views but due to being on 9th top floor the views can only be seen when standing up in room as windows are high up 
 i paid 120 to get room with a c it was tiny old room when told them ac is not working they sent someone he came and told he can t fix it please open the window
 room was a closet more or less concept idea that is popular in trendy hotels like ipad controls in the room are always a bad idea not charge properly doesn t work etc 
 the swimming pool on the roof is very small but nice to sit around 
 we were given a room for disabled people the toilet bowl was uncomfortable we stayed here in december and the rooms were a little chilly even though we reported the broken toilet seat and the staff confirmed that it will be changed they didn t 
 disappointing choice of cheese at breakfast for a country that is producing such a variety might seem like a detail but it is easy to do better with little extra cost 
 carpet in the room
 i felt as though some of the technology was unnecessary sometimes it s easier to use a switch 
 nothing
 hotel is on a busy street which is has very good benefits but can be a little noisy 
 light in the room walkways
 there was no iron in the room but once we asked for this it was brought up to us the room had everything but was a little small 
 reception was very busy for check in out but staff did their best to allieviate queues
 the hairdryer flex was twisted to such an extent it was difficult to use and the end kept falling off 
 response time from the guest services
 bathroom very compact shower over bath awkward and not that easy to control water direction toilet in bathroom needed fixing during our stay poor flush room very hot 
 only issue was that we had specifically booked a single room with a bath and a double room but on arrival were told the only rooms with baths were doubles and we were expected to pay the normal double price ie a supplement to get a room with a bath as the hotel had been renovated since we made the booking we had not been informed of this change despite emails welcoming us to our forthcoming trip etc only way round it was for us to take a double with bath and a single with shower and then to swap rooms at bathtimes not very satisfactory and we do not think this was fair treatment by the hotel management 
 portable air con unit in the room that made a loud noise terrible shower that was freezing or red hot i walked out of the breakfast 
 the only complaint is about the plumbing in the bathroom sink which drained slowly other than that our accomodations were comfortable 
 there is absolutely nothing not to like 
 rooms a touch small 
 couldn t open window i hate air conditioning only rooms 
 nothing
 i genuinely cannot fault any part of my experience of this hotel breakfast was also lovely and bar area was very comfortable
 check in procedure not good no greeting 
 wifi is a joke there s no good signal in the room i was in front of the elevator in the middle of the floor and hardly ever getting connection 2 out of 4 nights wasn t working all make sure you carry your gb s along on roaming 
 access stairwell carpet a bit grubby leak from pipes in nearby room flooded hallway carpet so the smell was not nice for a couple of days though the staff had the problem fixed quickly 
 bit expensive not upgraded bathrooms
 you hear every talk and step from the corridor while being in the room and that s just one minus
 cleaning service knocking at 9 am on sunday morning when the door is locked from inside room is really too hot at night and you have people saying this since one year do something 
 nothing
 hated leaving 
 room 1024 and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner 
 bed small and uncomfortable i chose the hotel for the location and gym the only gym in the world who has operating hours 10am to 4pm seriously i mean you have hours that make sure no one ever uses the facility 
 you could hear the elevator engine from the room 
 room was small and decorations and furniture tired fine if you want a hotel to sleep in and not much more which we did 
 room was on the small size as was the ensuite shower only no bath tried ordering a snack through room service around 11 00pm but nothing doing 
 the room furniture was older than me and the cleaners and handyman need a lesson or two to say the least just needed a bed to crash on but i d expect more for the price i paid bearing the stars it s been given
 the roon is too small
 the room was comfortable but it was also a little on the small side there was no blind at the shower window
 nothing
 very difficult to find something i don t like after some thought i would say some rooms don t have a good view ours 3101 looked out across what appeared to be some industrial commercial roofs
 slowwww wifi
 builders were working so it was noisy in the day 
 nothing
 on arrival i was told i d been upgraded which was great however shortly after i d unpacked my stuff i received a call from the receptionist saying and i quote you didn t tell me i d given you the wrong room i was dismayed and asked what she meant how was i supposed to know apparently she d misheard me and given me a mr a hall s room she asked me to go down and sign another form which i did and when i did so i told the receptionist to please not say i had not told her and asked how i was meant to know she showed me the form that i had signed which fair enough did have another name at the top but to be fair i hadn t stood there and read it before i signed i don t think it s unreasonable of me to assume that she d done her job right and i wasn t very happy that she was blaming me for her mistake i did offer to move rooms and don t get me wrong she wasn t rude in her manner or anything but i still take exception to being accused of something the way she said i hadn t told her gave the impression that i was trying to do something underhand which i most certainly wasn t 
 the only thing i could note as it could put down the all over 4 star experience was the f aking ceiling above the shower but its nothing that would ruin a trip 
 everything is extra you have to pay to use the hotel pool the hotel gym the hotel internet 
 very narrow stairs lift was only for one person air conditioning didn t work 
 furniture battered rather than distressed towels and d cor adequate wiring on a lamp and socket need attention 
 lady receptionists were standoffish disappointed also need to vacuum room daily would be nice to have bidet in guest toilets 
 nothing
 nothing
 smallest hotel room i have ever been the room was so small that it had a custom build in bed that was too small for a grown man to sleep in i am 1 86 meters and that was too tall to sleep in this bed impossible to make the room dark don t expect to get any rest in this hotel 
 we found the electronic light control limited our choice of lights on off eg we couldn t easily have the lounge lights off and just a single reading light on in the bedroom area not a huge issue if it had been just the two of us but we had our child set up on the sofa bed so it was just a small frustration for us 
 i have been at this hotel and at other axel hotels several time but this time was definitely the last time room air condition didn t work water in basis didn t run through disgusting no shower towels wake up call forgotten reception didn t handle complaint properly from check until check out staff was impolite and arrogant breakfast very basic and less quality and quantity than before i am traveling through out the year a lot and can recommend to book other hotels in barcelona for less money and better quality and service 
 the room was not cleaned properly every morning is scramble eggs for breakfast except one morning there is not even scramble eggs breakfast is the same every morning 
 that i couldn t stay longer 
 the cost of breakfast at 12 50 a head seems a bit on the steep side 
 the hotel bar is so expensive we spent 150 on drinks between 2 of us in an hour most expensive bar i ve ever been too 
 the ladies doing the breakfast seating were very abrupt i m sure due to pressure of workload but i got told to stand and wait while couples and groups behind me in the queue were seated then i had to sit at a crappy table so i felt quite marginalised
 nothing at all just little far from the centre 
 the toilet is too small for comfort breakfast area is too small for the hotel crowd suggest to ask guests to register their intended eating time to manage the crowd
 the steets are very busie
 from the start our experience was bad there was only one person on check in so we had to queue having been allcated our rooms we had to change them as we had specified adjacent or interconnecting rooms which they failed to do we then had to queue up again for the one person still on reception and 45 minutes later were allocated 2 adjacent rooms but one of the rooms had a smell of drains which i reported and which the very discourteous duty manager thalia refused to deal with in fact she told me several times that i was wrong the rooms were small the beds very soft and the shower and toilet were part of the bedroom the smell of drains was coming from the shower for such an expensive hotel this was unacceptable especially the way the duty manager treated her customers i don t think i have ever encountered a more unpleasant manner in my many years of travelling 
 i don t think the bed linen was changed for our arrival 
 the staff were very off was made to feel uncomfortable more than once and the bar staff took half an hour to serve me and my friend had that drink and went straight to bed they were that rude would not recommend this hotel based on the staff 
 from the minute to walking in to walking out it was awful order room for 7 5 euro they got it wrong we ordered breakfast they got it wrong more room service wrong their service was the worst i have ever seen no friendly words the final store come to the bar and get the wine no no no they should get it for you the pool etc was restrictive the staff were rude there is nothing good i can say about this place 
 n a
 no mirrors outside of bathroom for partner to do make up hair etc
 very little indeed 
 regulation
 nothing
 local environment not fantastic but not a major issue
 i think their bathrooms need refurbishing 
 tiny room very dark and noisy towels that were old like sandpaper with holes in them breakfast was like being in a cafeteria get your own cutlery serviettes etc i felt for 325 a night it was poor value will never use this hotel again 
 slow check in and fairly basic room but ok for one night stay 
 i booked through booking com and accidentally booked x2 rooms for two of us for two nights they kindly cancelled the second room which of course they didn t have to so we re very grateful that a booking error didn t cost us 
 small bed for couple
 prices to expensive for the room
 very poor breakfast very small room expensive i could hear all the rooms no sound proof walls
 the lifts being broken
 we rented bikes from the hotel to ride into the city we had a blast but found out you actually get a better deal on bikes if you rent from in the city center next time we would take the metro into town and rent bikes there instead 
 the room and bed were small with barely inches either side for getting around yet the bathroom and shower were excellent
 the standard rooms are extremely small bed is up against the wall on one side 
 initial room was in the basement dark and i cant remember a window but they found us an acceptable room on the 2nd floor 
 the room is cramped no drawers only 1 shelf in the closet we had to keep most of our clothes in the suitcases only 1 power outlet for the rest you have to unplug the lamps and the kettle tiny old fashioned safe a regular laptop wouldn t fit only a netbook hard uncomfortable pillows had to sleep without no space for clean clothes in the bathroom small bath towels micron thin toilet paper shower temperature jumps between hot and cold poor selection of tea 2 black 2 earl grey 
 da vinci hotel is located in isolated neighborhood surrounded by deserted buildings this was scary 
 only thing i noted was that the make up mirror did not adjust up or down so i had to dip down to see my face hall side of the room could be just a bit quieter could hear people leaving now and then it was a minor issue 
 nothing
 curtains had the remote control to operate them and sometimes they started living their own life for several minutes
 wish i could have stayed longer a great find 
 nothing
 very petty separate shampoo and conditioner bottles for toiletries rather than the all in one bottles would be great larger towels would be better but there were nice thick robes anyway 
 we booked the hotel for the picture of the bath tub and requested it also in website we were told that they didn t have a room with a tub but to ask again tomorrow since we were staying until monday called the next day to request if they had a room with a tub on saturday and the man on the phone was very rude on the call and basically said they have done everything they could for me and if i didn t like it i could just check out so we checked out on saturday and moved to a better hotel with a friendlier staff 
 aircon was always noisy even when we switched it off
 maybe free hot drinks machines on each floor in the ironing room aside from that already planning to go back 
 the junior suite that we stayed in had a number of paint chips on the walls it made things look pretty tacky and was not a sign of quality the beds were tidied and not made on the three nights that we stayed the tea and coffee items were not replaced at all which meant when we wanted a drink there was nothing to have the toilet was in a cupboard i m aware that it was in a historical building the doors did not close properly and did not offer privacy there was no air system there should have been some comfortable addition to the flooring in the bathroom bar the concrete no mention was made when we booked on the ongoing work outside generally the room was not comfy and was a little austere 
 fairly hot room so the dong of the radiator cooling down at midnight was noticeable for a long time a bit further to the tube than i had hoped 20 minutes walk but pleasant enough 
 the required payment was not aligned with the booking confirmation
 not very clean hair on the bathroom floor mirror dirty lack of lighting in the living room 
 pricey breakfast
 room needed updating esp painting tiny reception area 
 the hot buffet breakfast was poor as you only got to choose from bacon sausage and scrambled egg most other hotels have beans black pudding and mushrooms as well the jam on the table was used by other guests and not replaced when the table was remade we found bed was very soft
 rooftop bar closed at 9pm
 the food at the hotel bar wasnt the best
 n a
 went to use the gents on the first floor the first two toilets i went to where in a very unpleasant state and the people in the room next to us or opposite kept us awake with their child s and their own noise level
 bar closed at 23 00 no after this hour available to guests
 no carpet in the room bed not fix good to the floor
 rooms were quite small 
 see my comments re breakfast it was truly disgusting the waiter did not seem at all surprised when he came and removed my still almost full plate of this revolting mess how can anyone fail to prepare a decent english breakfast it must take some unusual skill to achieve this 
 size of room very small
 bed was flimsy and moved around
 na
 very expensive and description of rooms misleading 
 we would have loved a nice bath to relax in other than showers 
 nothing 
 the rooms were small
 the beds were not very comfortable but ok the rooms has no tea or coffee however there were 2 bottles of complementary water which was good 
 n a
 hair dryer in bathroom would be nice
 pillows were torture breakfast not appealing at all even coffee was bad 
 i would ve preferred a bath to a shower and a view of hyde park 
 can t fault
 not enough blankets on the beds 
 poor accomadation
 i wish there was a shuttle service to from the airport 
 price of beer lol 
 the location was a bit off but very manageable it is very well connected via tram 2 and metro 50 
 too high price not trustable street very small rooms and dirty glass and dirty places
 they need additinal staff at the concerige as sometimes it gets busy 
 the room was no better than a premier inn i was disappointed considering the price reputation of the hotel premier inn more comfortable spacious
 could have free breakfast included as part of the deal
 some areas were under renovation around us noise was not an issue however having to reroute patrons to an entrance to the elevator requiring the use of steps with luggage was a real pain close to bus line but about 15 min or more to closest tube wifi did not work very well from our room 
 i can t think of anything negative to say about this hotel my stay was only 1 night 
 nothing would def book again
 the room we were originally checked in to was cramped very uncomfortable bed and creaky air conditioning unit i queried the check in staff about the room provided and we were changed to the next room size which included a small study room next to the bedroom which we were happy with 
 room door make noise when closing small hair on the toilet floor and shower floor from the previous guest when we just got in to the room i m very sensitive with this thing one of the towel was dirty have small black dust on it 
 cold room with non working thermostat
 see through doors and windows in the bath room this was a problem as we traveled with our daughter 
 one of the two lifts was out of order so at peak times much pressure on the one working lift unfortunate at the weekend 
 bed could be better
 nothing
 the window view was an air conditioner and made noise
 nothing
 service cleaning staff was extremely rude and even screamed at us room smelled strange facilities looked okay but were really cheap and not well maintained breakfast was not good at all very bad selection and display would not stay here anymore
 no air conditioning 
 the beds were poor they was just two single bed up to each other s 
 room size you can hear the street noise they should fix double glass windows water flush sound is very noticeable
 i paid 150 gbp and i got a room downstairs in a basement without a lift or a window turned out to be quite depressing won t be coming back 
 the staff was quite rude and very obviously did not like americans i was not informed about the executive floor the complimentary breakfast nor did i receive assistance with airport transportation my room was not clean and i was placed 10 floors away from my son despite the fact that i booked both suites 5 months in advance
 asked for a double got a twin
 ketlle in the room was not working
 the photo booth didn t work gutted
 quite expensive for an average size room and basic facilities but it s the location you re paying for 
 lobby is very small 
 brochure in room indicated that there was a pool not so breakfast was an extra 9 50 each which is what we paid in cafe for both of us rooms were dated everything worn and old fashioned but it was comfortable 
 the bathroom especially the toilet was really dirty there was no information material about the hotel s facilities in the room there was no wardrobe in the room only shelves we ordered breakfast with roomservice the first morning it came the second day it didn t come there was a kettle in the room with teabags and coffee but not one single teaspoon or anything else to stir the coffee with there was only one extra pillow in the room which was a double room there was a minibar but it was empty the room was also really small 
 expensive breackfast
 the sky bar wasn t open in the week
 shower head was broken and sink wouldn t drain 
 housekeeping knocking the door
 in our room the temperature control was not working properly we informed the staff and somebody came to check it but the control was not repaired in the bathroom a double lavabo and some more space for the toilet bags would allow additional comfort 
 the room smelt like ciggerettes
 very old fashioned design of the room terrible sound proofing of the room old materials old bed no key card for the room instead enormously big and heavy key chain with a key super slow elevator
 the gym was small and cramped with the equipment it had in it 
 disabled bathroom hopeless 
 restaurant did not enjoy our dinner american hambyrg very dry
 we are in 2015 and you don t provide a free wifi you are not a four seson hotel you are just a cheap hotel unbelievable the bed was very poor there was something worng with the materess as usually happens in the uk it seems that you are making a favour to the staff to have reserv a room in their hotel 
 room is rather cosy but perfect for a short stay comfortable and reasonably priced
 wifi should definitely be free with these prizes 
 didn t know before we arrived that there was no maid service but could pay extra if wanted also breakfast excellent but very expensive as extra
 nothing
 cheese
 room v basic for cost
 family size room was small and bathroom not as private as should be 
 the hairdryer started burning up and smelt like it was about to blow at any second other than this i was very happy with my stay the price of breakfast was a bit hefty but it s london so was expected 
 room wasn t ready on arrival and when we did get in it was very very hot 
 ridiculously expensive
 breakfast no big
 they did not respect our request for early accommodation in the room so we could not rest after the road somewhere on our floor there was a dog that did not stop barking and we could not sleep well why are dogs accepted in a 4 star hotel there is no good isolation and noises are heard from other guests in close rooms 
 very noisy road no breakfast in the price room clean but basic for the price could do with some refurbishment 
 breakfast could have been better 
 more tea and coffee for free in the main room would have been good 
 none 
 bar service slow 
 restaurant area does not have much atmosphere and is a bit clinical 
 the reception staff at check in not at all helpful and didn t speak english that well however the porter s door men were very helpful
 1 marked parking only for 40 vehicles yet hotel has 211 rooms where s the extra spaces 2 be careful not to place money card into car park machine which is for visitors not residents 3 layout of split wardrobes clothes section could be improved with a shelves in the bottom of the wardrobe 4 bathroom shaving mirror should be of extendable type as too far away from basin 5 table top ironing board should have instructions 6 the desk chair seating height cannot be changed 7 the room menu does not encourage healthy eating as both the full english breakfast and the continental breakfast are the same price
 nothing 
 queueing to check in was a problem
 nothing
 no coffee machine in the room breakfast very expensive
 a bit far from city center
 the only negative was that on the saturday night there was a wedding reception in the hotel which went on until 1am at which the music was so incredibly loud you could hear every word and feel the pounding of the bass in our room 2 floors away when we phoned reception they said they would ask them to turn the music down but nothing changed 
 strength of wifi in rooms needs to be improved works better in lobby no service room but good nearby places 
 bit far out from city centre 
 small room view of wall expensive
 i do feel that 3 coffee capsules per day between 2 people are inadequate 
 staff not very helpful carpets and general decor a bit elderly 
 location is very bad and not good hotel for people who can first time to london 
 they have one elevator only it takes time to got it especially in the morning so you will need to use stairs most of the time which is not suitable for wheelchair users they didn t mention that we have a continental breakfast in the reservation which has very few items so don t be surprise if you want to eat more you have to pay five pounds or you will stick to the available croissant and salad 
 if you are in avenue room then it s very noisy it would have been much better if they have installed sound proof windows 
 no airconditioner with 37 degree 
 to expensive for the what the rooms actually are we payed around 420 for 2 nights and the room we had was very very small i d advise staying at a boutique hotel as you would probably get your money s worth
 advertised as a 4 star hotel yet sheets and bedding was stained standard of cleanliness of room was not great 
 staff was typically spanish didn t really care about you were telling them room was dirty urine spots when lifting the toilet seat see picture of the toilet lighting in the room is a mess flooding the room including the carpet every day as the shower was clot and no one cared to chance that towels not even folded just thrown in stains on the floor definitely not a 4star sup hotel not even for spanish standard 
 fairly basic facilities glass between toilet and bedroom creating very little privacy 
 the room was clean enough except there was a spider in the room 
 bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in 
 no room service
 receptionist she sent us to a couple of apartments even knowing that we have a baby access was very difficult for us and the rooms were so noisy we asked to be relocated to the main building and she assigned another room with stairs being difficult for the baby and one that was busy when we asked for another one this last one had also stairs even more it has two floors in one it has the bed and the bathroom in the other when we moved from the apartment almost by ourselves because the personel was very busy we forgot few things that never returned to us even though we claimed for them in two occasions 
 we ordered still water late in the evening and got sparkling had to call reception again to get right water bottles delivered
 being forced to pay for the room on arrival pretty jarring after a long hot journey when all we wanted to do was freshen up as apparently this is quicker than charging everyone at check out but but of course we also had to settle the bill at check out ridiculous system that meant we just had to queue twice as long there s a reason the vast majority of hotels worldwide dont do this despite the opinion of the ill informed staff at check in for 130 per night i would expect a mould free shower taps that don t take 5 mins to cool down warm up and some basic amenities in the room no kettle no iron 2 bottles of water only in the fridge felt like a large hostel not a hotel 
 nothing all good 
 small swimming pool
 the pillows were too big and too hard now suitable for all sleeping needs one soft and one hard would be better 
 small rooms
 the bed was uncomfortable the bose sound system was not there even though it was advertised 
 nithing 
 room at high floor was too small choose lower levels wifi kept cutting off and 3g the same thing administration have to solve this issue 
 the gym could have been alot bigger with more facilities
 there was a bad water leak from apartment above but staff quickly moved me to another room and i received a free breakfast and all worked out fine 
 bathroom was a bit faded glory
 limited time for facilities
 would have been useful to have an explanation of what all the switches in the room were for 
 food ordered through room service was very poor there was far too much salt in the buttermilk which was not corrected despite multiple reminders not up to taj standards
 shower was strange in that the door opened outwards and when you came out of the shower the water leaked all over the floor not so good
 the doors key old fashioned 
 was a little chilly that night and could have done with an extra layer 
 the rate on booking com did not match what we were charged be aware was quoted 15 extra a night 
 found nothing wrong during my 5 day stay so that s a good indicator 
 it was perfect 
 receptionist was not friendly and not helpful room were small and old furnished bathroom was very small
 very poor lighting in the room very poor internet connection
 the mattress was too soft
 having to re subscribe to the wifi every day was a nuisance also tv options were very limited 
 one tiny criticism we were asked what type of water in the room said sparkly and still came but it did not really matter too much its a first world issue can think of others to get more stressed about 
 pillows were stiff and high ended up not using them carpark should be free 
 the entertainment system was flaky and the remote wouldn t work from our bed 
 the only thing i could suggest is the windows are locked and do open would have been nice to have some fresh air rather than air conditioning
 extremely small bedroom and very reduced bathroom very tired furniture
 the staff in the front desk is terribly unkind and dry 
 the coffee machine was very dusty we were only given two small paper cups no plates or cutlery sudden city tax charge the breakfast looked a bit lacklustre
 very soft bed and pillows no mattress protector the coverlet was not clean no wastebasket in the toilet 
 only teeny tiny criticism i have is the pillows on the bed are very flat not much head support overall bed was still very comfortable though 
 in some of the rooms air ventilation noise even though the air con is off
 the breakfast not included and general food prices
 the staff are not especially friendly or helpful and the hotel is fairly noisy every door opening and closing every footstep every tv is very audible 
 rather small bathroom
 you have to buy internt you dont have internet in your room becuse i ve got the boocing trow booming com and internet for each you have to pay 20
 bathrooms too small and no lift 
 does nt have gym
 building work going on so entrance round the side very compact
 food cleankiness and service 
 underground sound heard from the room
 there were no windows in any of the hotel rooms at all there was air con but i feel that some people would not book if they knew this up front it may have made me change my mind before we stayed but it was ok to be fair i also had a query on my bill which i emailed the hotel about they sent a copy through to me but on a further query regarding 2 items charged to our room i have heard nothing it seems it is not up for discussion service was extremely slow for breakfast and waiter service outside to the point that we had to leave without our drinks arriving before we headed out hence i feel this was one of our extra charges to our room even though we did not receive them and could not find a waiter to cancel the order 
 not all the facilities in the spa were working and no jacuzzi
 nothing 
 the air con was struggling with a very hot july
 the fact they only give you two paper cups for tea for a stay of two days and don t refill your teabags coffee sachets in your tea compartment i had too ring reception to bring us new tea bags coffee sachet more bottle water for the kettle and also another glass cup which we only had one and there was two of us staying i do think if it s a 4 that should just be mandatory 
 poor room service not value for money limited breakfast options
 room was a little cramped
 wifi very poor
 n a
 extra bed was not comfortable
 when checked in advised staff of stain on chair and a double doona in king bed asked to be fixed asked repeatedly and was not rectified after 3 follow up requests see picture for undersized doona 
 tv was too complicated didn t like sliding door between toilet and shower corridors very dark
 hot breakfast buffet would have been nice but i suppose the price would not 
 the wifi its too so slow to connect and i have to open the tv just be able to connect on the wifi 
 breakfast was chaotic and average bathroom has been renovated but quality compromised 
 nothing to be honest waiting for pret a manger to open it s the door next to the hotel entrance to have some breakfast options 
 nothing it was super
 nothing
 the room was far too hot with no way to cool it down a fan did not reduce the temperature enough nor did opening the window sweating all night was not pleasant 
 we booked 6 superior rooms and only got 2 of it because the staff let other people stay longer in our room to be honest if not because the superior room i wouldn t choose to stay at this hotel because the standard rooms are very old the most unpleasant about this stay is the front desk staffs not only they didn t give the rooms we booked and didn t apologies nor give us compensation staying here make me feel like i own them something with their fake smile and poor attitude i wouldn t recommend anyone to stay here not only my group that has problem while i was trying to work things out at the front desk there was also other guest complaining with the similar problem we stayed for 2 nights and right on the first day i ask to talk to the manager they said he she will come tomorrow for 3 days that i have been told the same old lie that he is coming tomorrow and he has never show up worst experience of hotel in italy for me i am doing an itaian luxury gourmet tour for 4 years and this hotel is the worst i have ever stay in italy 
 the breakfast is poor there was dust in the room on the coffee machine and all furniture and the vending machine inside the room was not filled they only offer free water the 1st day
 2 single beds pushed together to make a larger bed is not really appropriate for a 4 star hotel
 n a
 i asked for a quiet room but ended up in one facing the busy street the room has lots of mold in the bathroom and smelled bad 
 difference between the website pictures and reality comfort more 3 stars
 location
 the rooms are really small and the shower has poor water pressure
 nothing will return 
 nor the staff un atentive unfriendly didn t quite express themselves in english nor the room broken door bathroom in need of a major overhaul nor the corridor leading to the room dirty nor the service nothing but a glass in the room nor the air conditioning un existant nor the wi fi impossible to connect to honestly one of my worst hotel experiences in my entire life 
 rooms a bit small but had everything we needed
 i was staying for 3 nights and on several occasions i found my empty water bottles and used coffee caps not taken by the cleaning service the floor carpet itself was not at the best condition it can 
 the ac was useless it was a hot week in vienna and it only gave more hot air
 not that spacious for 3 personns
 nothing
 air conditioning not working properly
 everything
 super hard bed 
 the size of the room the double bed was up against the wall
 we have been charged twice for the first two days we stayed at the hotel the problem is still pending with no response from the hotel so far 
 check in could be faster
 all perfect
 difficult to get fresh milk for tea minor issue as it was obtained on 2 of the 3 nights after a little wait and efforts of hotel staff 
 everything was nice without a kettle the kettle was already wet and black things were in the kettle it might be washed but i felt it was dirty 
 i had to leave 
 always annoying when staff make a big deal checking money ulster bank sterling its either sterling or euro guys no such thing as irish money 
 it was just like a motel 
 staff were aloof cold and not that helpful 
 very basic rooms and eclectic crowds stay in this hotel 
 staff very poor in service no blankets at the hotel we slept with only sheetes to cover the kids requested during the two nights but the answer that they don t have it i had a nother reservation at the same location which thankfully i cancelled 
 no back entrance to load unload
 our room was best described as average not really hilton worthy 
 n a
 the only thing i could possibly think of is that the loo handle in the bathroom sticks down sometimes 
 nothing
 small room
 no wifi in rooms only in lobby small room 
 we ordered some beverage items to be sent up to the rooms they never arrived so we had to re order not impressed 
 wasnt anything we didnt like
 alotugh room was lovely it was a bit too small there was no tea facilities in the room but you could go down to reception to make one 
 room needs renovation 
 cramped room no room for anything other than the bed 
 wifi low signal but everything else was great 
 nothing
 slight smell in room 
 nothing negative to say at all 
 location was conveniently close to the metro but there is not much around the hotel so you have to take transport to get to tourist sites and central area room decor and furniture was dated but clean and comfortable 
 hotel bar
 layout of room 964 handicapped room could be better especially the bathroom water from shower goes all over floor there must be a way to contain it to the designated area hooks are too high up for a person in a wheelchair there should be some towel racks next to the sink the only place to put toiletries was on a high pedestal behind the toilet not convenient for a person who is handicapped 
 the price that i was quoted online when i reserved the room was not the price that i was charged i was actually charged almost 100lbs more than i was supposed to be this is quite annoying and frankly it is not good value for what you obtain for that price i would have booked a more up scale hotel small additional annoying issue the pillows are massive but impossible to sleep on since they are foam and do not give so after the first night i had to make my own pillow from a towel and sweaters the tea at breakfast was so weak it was horrible and the coffee tasted horrible also my bathroom door jammed shut and i could not use it one morning and had to leave and asked the hotel staff to repair it good thing i was not locked inside 
 neighbourhood is a bit off putting but it may improve no easy chair but how many hotel bedrooms have one these days 
 reception staff very unfriendly and nervous 
 beds very hard
 was extremely noisy i was awake the whole night hearing people walking around plus the bed everytime i moved in the bed the noise 
 nothing
 air con unit noise kettle had to hold it on to boil room service food cold 
 room was quite small and almost all the space was taken up by the large bed only one small window which had zero view as the glass was frosted was all right for one person spending most of my time out of the room but would not have worked for two people a larger person or someone who needed to spend more time in the room for example working plumbing in the room seemed old bathtub was slippery even when bath mat used whole mat slipped and toilet flush box would not refill after first use had to flush toilet by pouring a bucket of water manually and then call maintenance it was repaired the same evening but did not make a good impression bathtub lacked any sizable shower enclosure making it hard to keep shower water in tub wi fi did not work well was very glitchy and not very useful for anything other than facebook or light web browsing upon one return to the hotel a doorman actually blocked my way until i explained i was a guest although he apologized when he realized i was actually staying there 
 no gym spa included in the price not great location bathroom a bit outdated 
 problem with bath not emptying request to fix but not done and had to call room service to empty on second night again shower hose too short causing it to spray all over bathroom also in the way while showering dinner service was shocking the one waiter serving 2 tables only kept forgetting to return with request for butter and parmesan cheese on pasta dish bed sheets made but not change daily 
 nothing
 parking was i think 15
 n a
 the bed was so hard
 it would be better to have the complimentary water bottles restocked everyday 
 size of room a little small
 they upgraded us on arrival but to be fair still felt it was a standard room and didn t feel that we had been upgraded
 everything is perfect 
 the air conditioning was really bad the night with 4 of us in the room was very uncomfortable 
 a few miles out of the city in a quite area of west amsterdam no shops or places to eat near by 
 room service atrocious wrong numbers on menu no answer on phone going through to ee voicemail when breakfast came only part of it bed very uncomfortable soundproofing non existent
 showers were very small
 very noisy room almost impossible to get some rest or relax you could hear everything outside the room like other clients or house keeping service very early in the morning
 better quality coffee in room
 service was atrocious initially i was told my room had been double booked so i had no where to stay then i was asked if it was ok to share a room with a total stranger staff were useless couldn t even get a tea bag brought up to my room 
 booked a double deluxe room and i was given a single room and very noisy
 awful level of attentiveness of reception staff clearly did not want to check us in when we arrived not friendly all rather snooty felt most unwelcome 
 took a while for lifts to arrive
 don t know
 everything hotel was so bad we moved rooms twice hotel is disgusting and out dated very poorly put together took ages to check in staff are extremely stuck up we resulted in leaving hotel and checking into a different one nearby 
 it was a little off the beaten track breakfast was not included which we were sure it was 
 the room was extremely dirty and dusty restaurant staff on 3rd floor could be more polite and accommodating
 the gym is way below standars
 the breakfast was nice but not very good 
 everything was great
 a little old building but not a big issue 
 everything was good 
 a little tired looking in places could do with an update in the room wait for lifts can be long due to number of floors 
 nothing
 room with a balcony amazing rooftop garden and excellent breakfast definitely recommend
 weak wifi in bedroom though strong enough in hallway 
 nothing 
 nil
 i ve had a double room which couldn t even fit 1 person properly the wardrobe was so small i couldn t get most of my stuff out of the suitcase there was a very small window which didn t allow ant light in the room the shower was leaking then they repaired it i think they give the worst rooms to booking com 
 chambermaid did the room very late afternoon 
 was worn and dated
 the room was a bit small it was difficult for us to fit both our suitcases into the very small available floor space 
 a bit too expensive for the same price you can have a much better room in a 4 hotel in switzerland the hotel recommended a nearby restaurant it had potential and wanted to be very gourmet by didn t quite deliver don t know if the hotel was undergoing restoration but certain details were overlooked like the elevator door with the paint all scratched up paint stains on the bathroom floor all in all a good hotel but that s it 
 it s not new anymore
 room service menu is a little limited
 
 unfortunately there was building work going on and started quite early in the morning so it was very noisy its a shame they do not inform about the building work beforehand also toilet is too small 
 locker card are demagnetised all time air condition doesn t work well
 the room was very hot especially on the first night and i was unable to lower the temperature or put a fan on 
 the room was very compact the toilet cubicle was tiny just enough room to sit down had to ask for the coffee sugar to be refilled in the room available coffee and cake downstairs but the coffee was cold and when we asked for a fresh one they offered to microwave the coffee the gym is tiny consisted of a treadmill a bike and some light free weights 
 single room was very small space to get into the shower would be a challenge for many plus sized travellers luckily i only had a carry on suitcase 
 our room was a very small double fine for one night but i would have found it cramped for longer however it was probably reflected in the price as it was very affordable 
 staff gave wrong room to start with so had to change
 location is on a busy street with bars restaurants so you have late night activity and associated noise till 2am then you will have the ryan bush collection of glass bottles at 4am so noise could be an issue for sensitive sleepers the hotel provide ear plugs
 access from lobby to room was really complex 2 elevators walking and using of safety card 3 times was needed 
 my daughter left her glasses in the room and used her contact lenses that day but for some reason the staff were unable to find them i believe they didn t look properly 
 the room did not have a good view 
 beds are not comfortable
 nothing
 breakfast was not included didn t realise and was very expensive 20 for a bowl of cereal was also put in a room that smelled terribly of smoke and because it was the last room of its type was forced to upgrade my room which cost 20 night 
 breakfast was very basic
 waiting in the queue for a long time to check in and out 
 i don t like room very small and no view of the city 
 the breakfasts were the worst we have ever encountered on monday morning we queued for over 10 minutes just to be able to share a table with another guest there was hardly any food left there was no milk no yoghurt no cheese just a few scraps of cucumber and tomato there was no menu eventually the waitress said that we could have eggs mushrooms and green beans adding sausages later if requested toast was available but only the cheapest white sort tea was dispensed from a teapot that clearly was carried from table to table using the same teabag the following day was slightly better but still scarcely believable the man on reception shrugged his shoulders and gave the impression that this was not an unusual occurrence the shower in the bathroom was rusty and the supposed side jets did not actually reach your body there were used unwashed cups left from the previous resident 
 no super markets near
 the room is outdated and the ac made weird noises 
 value for money is appoling to me this aint a boutique hotel its a rip off for the price u pay u expect a clean worn free room the staff need better customer service dont look down their nose at certain types of people were all human i work in this industry and was highly dissapointed 
 leaving and flying back to sydney 
 there was no minibar in our room there were no leisure facilities e g a pool 
 restaurant wifi rooms design not friendly staff
 stupid staff only want money never book
 restaurant staff needs some work
 would have loved tea coffee making facilities in the guestroom 
 foot steps of guest from the corridors in the rooms 
 the mattress was extremely firm not comfortable at all 
 bed was a foam mattress on top on the main mattress reasonably certain comfortable but it slid around no shampoo
 would have liked free internet only available to premium rooms 
 no coffee in the room everything was just average 
 actually nothing 
 no wifi in the room at all 
 bedcloth is a little old the rooms also need renovation safe in the room is 4eur night 
 could have done with a hairdryer in the room
 training facilities bigger lobby 
 way overpriced
 the mini bar in the room was not working broken door 
 1 the reception staff took city tax from my wife although she was a milan resident and italian which is against rulse they told me the computer system couldnt exclude here 2 the free car parking is behind the hotel and connected through about 45 ledder steps which means you have to carry your bags ups and downs those steps in check in and check out 3 no room boiler cafe or tea although its 4 stars hotel 4 the hotel isnt perfect for thoses with out cars most of the clients had cars and ao it was totally suiting them 
 nothing
 the modular pod like room with the bathroom and shower units in the middle of the room was awkward lacking in privacy and cramped 
 staff weren t really friendly felt like they were really hard front end staff and weren t really welcoming
 paid for club membership but hours to use the facility were limited 
 darker shades to keep out sun in the morning 
 there vas not a microwave in the room because we have a baby with us
 i asked for two fried eggs for my cooked breakfast and they were stone cold 
 nothing 
 noise from neighbouring room
 smell in room should be looked at
 bed was not so comfy and breakfast a little dull not worth 10 each
 room is very small bathroom less than two square meters can barely take a shower internet in the room standing offer can not be used in general for their money get nothing except not to sleep on the street 
 nothing needed to be better 
 no bar license for alcohol pillows and towels were to small
 the staff were amateurish at 11 pm another guest burst into my room the front desk had double booked my room very embarrassing and unforgivable will never stay here again 
 lifts seem to take ages check in time was 2pm but room not ready until after 2 30pm
 dirty rooms to the point you didn t want to take off shoes paint chips and massive cracks in the tiles both floor and shower leather on headboard and around tv was old and pealing room was tiny like harry potter under the stairs tiny 
 the price of breakfast went to mcdonalds instead 
 small gym
 it seems that staff has been brought from 1 star hotel very rude and un friendly attitude internet speed was very low 
 the room was too small not family friendly dinner gave my daughter food poisoning
 the choice of cocktails in the dong bar was strange would have liked to see some traditional cocktails listed the view more than made up for it though
 wifi can be a bit temperamental until you get it to work 
 our room wasn t ready at 4pm when we checked in at 1 pm very poor when you need to be out early in the evening hotel was very noisy with room doors banging all night only one shower gel in the room for two people no spoons little milk etc and even after we asked at reception there was no shower gel the next day so no attention to detail so will not be returning to the hotel again
 my room overlooked a park where drunks gathered i was charged 176 just in case so i have been deducted 3 amounts for 2 rooms and i am still waiting for a refund no mention was made of tis on check in 
 car parking machine had no light we struggled to pay with our mobile phone light also breakfast was very basic
 lighting and decor in the rooms and hotel is a bit too dark and moody too many small spotlights too much dark wood breakfast was not good the boiled eggs were like rubber balls and the scrambled eggs were sloppy mould on the shower ceiling no extractor fan had been installed for the price i expected better 
 hotel is cramped for space 
 because this hotel is located in rambrandt square rambrandtplein lt had a liitle noisy at night 
 the croissants and baguette could be better more typically french 
 na
 smell of drains in the bathroom when emptying the bath only one roll of toilet paper which meant we used tissues until the room was serviced then they gave us two only tiny things though didn t really matter 
 the rooms are small and any rooms to the front of the hotel are extremely noisy i specifically requested a room away from lifts and stairs and in a quite part of the hotel when i made the initial booking i was allocated a room directly beside a lift and stairs when we arrived when i went to reception and requested a room away from lifts and stairs i was given a room at the front of the hotel which turned out to be very noisy at night it was that bad cleaning staff left ear plugs beside each bed everyday 
 front bedroom a touch noisy with traffic however on a high street this is expected would use again a very helpful staff suggested a few quiet rooms that are not overlooking the busy high street
 everything
 nothing 
 the only thing i just wish i would have upgraded the room it was really nice just a tad on the small size
 the room was too small but for one person it was ok
 bathroom was tiny so tiny that a larger person will have difficulties using the facilities 
 no phone in the room expenses from the bar reception desk etc can t be charged to the room 
 all good
 nothing really the breakfast room restaurant is a little small and difficult to conduct business but this is a small issue 
 nothing of note
 wifi too slow aircon didn t work
 not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position 
 room may need to be updated 
 the shower head in room 204 needs to be tightened 
 decor was a little dated in the room and bathroom could have done with a little attention
 hotel trying to add 36 on to the bill after booking com said the total to pay was only 180 hotel did reduce it back down to 180 after i logged into my booking com account and showed them the booking saying total to pay 180 
 one of the receptionists was very condescending patronising everyone that spoke to him including myself which gave a very bad first impression to me however the other receptionists were really pleasant 
 checking in was nightmare they messed up all the rooms then tried charging us to put extra bed in even though we requested twin rooms at 400 a night i would expect more from them would not stay there again
 the restaurant although decor and staff were great the menu was pretty uninspired and to be honest a let down in comparison to everything else
 the swimming pool closes too early it should have been 24 hours 
 the lighting in the room was pretty hard to work out so was very hard to get up in the night without accidentally putting on every light in the room
 1 staff blamed customer on the problem of the hotel itself 2 poor management on emergent case 3 they made us feel like we are not paying guests but prisoners that they could provide whatever service they want i m talking about the supply of electricity in 21th century i tried to think of something nice to say but i was furious during my stay all the sockets in my checked room had no power when we were back at round 10pm three staff came up and no one could fixed it we waited for more than an hour and requested to change a room but were told they were fully booked we tried to explain the importance of electricity can t believe this needs to be explained and they finally reluctantly brought us to a new room i was not mad before when the sockets found out to be nonfunctional but it was at that time i realized they had an attitude problem when they kept complaining that they didn t have an electrician to fix this at late hours so they don t want to solve this problem i felt like i have to push hard to ask them to provide a regular room the reason why they didn t do it in the first place was that the new room was an family suite one queen bed in a separate room and two single beds stuffed in the small entrance after 20 mins in the new room there happened a black out in our room we called to ask someone to check the room the receptionist said that he couldn t listen well and request us to go downstairs when i told him there were no electricity at all in my room he even blamed this problem to my laptop and my cell phone seriously considering his attitude i understand i can t rely on him to solve the issue so i requested a new room card to try again the next day i found out that it was because of the electricity card slot was installed the way that the card has to be inserted horizontally therefore the card will slip out if you didn t push it too hard into the wall due to gravity 
 when we use the bathtub hydro massage there were some small black larvae that came out of the system tubes the hotel management changed our room to one with a better view and offered us a bottle of wine but that was not enough to forget that the maintenance is not done the price was very high for our expectations some staff where very friendly others not 
 room was shabby and not very clean
 paying to park the car
 the staff were not helpful the room was small and in the basement which is odd no privacy no soundproof i don t think that hotel is worth five star even four star is more than they deserve think for alternatives 
 appalling smell of drains
 weren t informed prior to booking that we could use the pool etc so didn t bring any kit 
 the beds were so comfy that getting out of them to seize the day was a challenge
 very small room with one small window difficult to control temperature so much too hot until staff adjusted controls at reception smoke alarm too sensitive so we were woken twice in the night no hot chocolate no biscuits 
 the room was quite small
 all good
 bit noisy but it s not the hotels fault 
 although overall very clean shower curtain over bath was a bit mucky at the bottom 
 tasty breakfast with a great choice of food but too expensive 
 privacy glass would have been better in the bathroom as you had to shut the lovely view out while in the bath bed was too hard for us lunch service in the restaurant was slow 
 one more tele should have been appreciated
 almost every service and facilities there is a mess they are running it like a lodge or guest house i hardly can give them 2 star ratings seriously bed was full of dust and some insects and i couldn t sleep because of allergy in my body and location is too isolated nothing nearby 
 bed was a little hard and dlr line can be heard until 12pm 
 comfortable bedroom but in the recent hot weather air con would have been good sleeping with an open window we were disturbed by the kitchen extract fans which were left running at night 
 nothing 
 i had to pay for the wi fi
 door keycard did not work on a number of ocassions having to go from the 11 floor on a number of times even the maintenence man couldn t get in the room separate email will be sent to the hotel
 would expect to find cotton buds pads in the bathroom in such hotel 
 the sound proofing between rooms is bad we were woke up by the noisy toilet and chatting sound of next door early in the morning the service for breakfast is very poor there was long queue of guest waiting for at least 5 10 min which is unacceptable for 4 5 stars hotel there are a lot of tables reserved but the guest did not turn up for 30 min we asked for tea and juice and need to remind it again after 10 min 
 lifts did not work no one offered to take my bag up the stairs
 bathroom ceiling was black shower rail was rusty shower head didn t fit properly and was not easy to use water came out in a single stream toilet dripped air conditioning was noisy and inefficient beds are very hard hotel bedrooms are very old and in need of some money being spent on them would not stay again drinks in the bar very expensive 16 for a double gin and tonic 
 small room for two and the internet was very slow in the room but worth it for the location and security 
 room was a bit small for a superior queen 
 room was too hot fixed by opening window 
 they dont provide room service the phone to call reception didnt work so i had to call from my mobile to main desk 
 no complaints 
 didn t stay long enough
 no tea and coffee facilities the downstairs bar and restaurant were closed for a private function 
 dripping airco unit
 none
 rooms were a little on the small side and the bed wasn t very comfortable
 amortization of room limited choice on breakfast not as expected in 4 hotel 
 not a great view bit further out than expected
 bathroom in the old section of the hotel
 the view from our room looked out on to a busy road
 views at rear and side of building one is a building site the other a train track but it is london
 we were there during a large convention and prices were nearly double what they normally are at all hotels 
 difficult to fault standard room price is fairly expensive as if most of paris but via booking com got a very good price 
 no tv in public rooms ie no wimbledon my cc was swiped at noon without me being present despite the fact that i told reception that i wasn t leaving till the afternoon i had checked out of my room and left my car in the garage and my suitcase with the porter
 outside area of hotel in carlisle street we found littered with rubbish and cigarette butts could be kept cleaned even though it s not hotel rubbish but overflow from corner pub i didn t like that we had to pay 220 while one other person only paid 175 for one night stay st the same time his account mistakenly given to us on checkout 
 not a big deal but there wasn t any coffee in our room only tea bags with a kettle
 rooms are too small split bathroom toilet is not a very good idea
 superior queen sized room was small the width was only a little longer than the bed only one arm chair although it s a double room but probably wasn t room for a second one room faced the inner courtyard which we thought would mean it was quiet but there was a private party in the bar one night that was very loud indeed and disturbed us even though we were on the fifth floor and although the party was meant to be in the bar it spilled out into the lobby so we had to push through to enter the hotel and get to the lift 
 price is little high slight renovation
 the weak point of the hotel is the location
 there was nothing to dislike 
 the air conditioning could have been a lot stronger the rooftop was booked out for events for a few of the days so a pre warning would have been preferred 
 the electricity went down for about an hour in our two rooms and we stayed with no electricity until someone come to fix it it was causee by a problem in their heater plug in one of the rooms that was bad and i had to claim the problem 2 times by phone and no one came until i went down to find the guy saying that he will come to fix the issue finally they fixed it after 1 hour we asked for a late checkout the receptionist was not helpfull and refused to give us a late checkout even when we mentioned the electicity issue i expected a better action they have to work more on their hotel reputation 
 the elevator is so bad because sometime it s hold and no work i think they didn t make for it maintains 
 lifts slow 
 the facilities are not what you expect of a 5 stars hotel no business area low elevator common areas look and smell old it was stuck and we couldn t take the stairs the bed was giant but the space to walk around it too narrow 
 district circle lines didn t have service between earl s court and edgware road so i had to take a bus to high st kensington when i left the hotel i walked to gloucester road 
 didn t keep the bar open fri but did sat night 
 breakfast at weekends bit expensive 
 the bed was not great
 no individual reading lights not good
 there was a lot of noise around the hotel especially at night 
 recently there was slow wlan for free and a faster one against extra payment now there was no wlan at all included for a hotel used by business travellers an absolute no go the bathroom was so small there was no space for your cosmetics etc 
 moving bed 
 wifi signal weak and slow
 it s too far from the public transpo and city center 
 fotos promise a lot more than you get 
 myself and my friend accidently left some items of clothes in the wardrobe which were subsequently stolen by a member of staff despite numerous phone calls and emails to the hotel we are now three weeks later and we have not once been contacted by the hotel to rectify this crime do not stay here if you value your belongings as they seem shockingly unconcerned that they employ thieves 
 out of the way location breakfast was not included in my rate 
 the bathroom
 th executive lounge could need some renovation and more choices
 pillows werent the best one not enough but two was too much and a tad too much traffic noise but i d defo stay again
 the breakfast need to improve
 bathroom a bit small but not a real issue at all
 nothing although the bed is just so comfortable you don t want to get out so you miss time sight seeing 
 the internet was slow at times and or the wifi signal was weak in my room they still have the old fashion keys whereas you have to surrender the key every time you go out and have to ask for it every time you come back to the hotel which is rather inconvenient not to mention the transfer of germs from hand to hand 
 nothing
 size of the bed too small noise from air conditioning party by our room wedding very loud we should have been told and given option to move nothing was offered outside scaffolders at 5 in the morning we were exhausted
 breakfast was a bit of a challenge no table numbers allocated and wasn t advised of a table number which was required when you placed your requirements to the chef who was cooking the eggs even the waiting staff had difficulty in locating the right tables on hindsight we would have booked room only and taken breakfast elsewhere 
 bed small and very low
 bed extremely uncomfortable pillows terrible ordered a wakeup call for flight never happened even though i rang to double check they had the request carpet old and shabby cold in the restaurant 
 a bit expensive but its an expensive city 
 i didn t like that an optional 12 5 service charge was added to your bill and you had to tell them to remove it if you didn t want to pay it then at the end of the bill you could add a gratuity if you chose to everyone paid the service charge but nobody liked the way it was done 
 the bedroom had a door to get to another bedroom and the people were very noisy could hear every conversation till 1 am not really good should have a soundproof door 
 slightly noisy at night as you could hear what s going on in the courtyard 
 toilet was not flushing properly
 none
 it s a kind of imitation of a hotel nothing about it is appealing 
 staff could not find booking at first
 if i had to criticise something i would say the bathrooms although impressive were not exactly functional the hand basin awkward and the shower you either were attacked from all sides by water such a waste or it was a hand held shower head the tv remote did not allow us to change language on the dual language programs so we gave up on the tv but this really is being over picky 
 location it s away from public transport just outside of milano hotel was just behind end of milano sign we also paid city tax but we were actually out of city location good for car only no ventilation bedroom either bathroom working in any room tried 3 to check no tv there was problem with cabling or something like that so no touch with world some of lamps in room had no bulbs and staff didn t have spare ones they reported to maintenance but wasn t fix during our stay 3nights smelly carpet shuttle bus service to nearest tube station running only till 10 30am in half an hour slots but mostly booked out had to walk 30min with with suitcase to nearest bus stop car park not available to guests even when there is a huge empty parking space behind hotel doesn t make sense 
 under construction beside but okay
 the room itself was a bit tired and not spotlessly clean some hairs on the chairs etc though the bedding and towels were absolutely clean 
 the room was very small 
 can t remember a specific thing
 the breakfast the eating place was dark and dull the service is very slow the food is tastless eggs never tasted this bad the kitchen does not match the hotels standards 
 nothing
 the view was a bit of a let down 
 all good
 very small room breakfast not included in the price
 ac barely works it is a huge flaw in late august in barcelona 
 facilities look very old has not been changed in a while
 loved it 
 they could have replaced the tea and coffee sachets and the bathroom products 
 small room no window in the toilet no parking at all
 room could be bigger but this is natural given that hotel is located historical building in old vienna 
 we had a room for three people and only had two towel sets when we called for extra towels it took nearly an hour for them to bring them up to the room on the 1st floor 
 smelly a c 
 the only thing we didn t like was leaving 
 the price of the drinks in the bar was very expensive
 small rooms not enough lightening personal is not careful
 had a room to the street unfortunalty some construction work in the morning but that was just temporary
 breakfast was really pricey probably due to it being in carluccios restaurant which is on the ground floor unfortunately tube closures meant the local station at swiss cottage was only a replacement bus service which meant a long walk to chalk farm to get about 
 prepaid booking only to be told city tax had changed we paid they would not bend contacted boking com you have said they will refund us point being when you repay somthing that should be end of it staff were helpful but not over friendly as they were always busy
 breakfast charges a little more than i would have expected for continental 
 no stairs and long wait for lift restaurant bar on the first floor was a little stuffy uninviting and expensive
 our room was small and a little tired 
 hotel had an issue with the water mains we kept running out water showers freezing
 nothing
 putting a mini refrigerator in the room will give added points providing complimentary drinking water would improve the image does anyone don t brush their teeth everyday i think this is the least thing every guest would expect not to see in a hotel bathroom 
 breakfast did not impress three types of cereal milk and toast from tesco for 16 gbp i would expect a nice continental buffet from a place at this level
 tv remote control wasn t working in the morning however after reporting it i am sure it would hae been rectified by the attentive staff 
 upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke stairs inside room to the bed room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do would not recommend this hotel 
 the room wasn t clean we were there for 2 nights our room was not cleaned by housekeeping 
 not being able to open the windows but that s just me and my husband we prefer fresh air to air conditioning but one does wonder if london does have fresh air as it is very busy with traffic and constant crowds of people london is lovely to visit for a short break and this hotel is ideal 
 very loud neighbours poor sound between rooms got woken up bed was old and only fair
 room could have been larger but that wouldn t stop us from coming back
 location rooms without a view made this hotel not a viable option for us shopping and markets were very few near hotel also the massive construction happening out front made it very dangerous on foot 
 maid service was poor being asked to settle account every couple of days was tiring 
 the only con is the noise coming from la rue d amsterdam and the window do not filter it very well luckily it is quite calm at night 
 the booking of rooms being non refundable yet not even charged to the company credit card used to book online leaving the people staying in the rooms to pay for themselves 
 5 star hotel is without parking and i had to use station parking little far from hotel which was a big problem followed
 coffee and tea should have been replenished better by looking what was used
 maybe there could of been 4 towels per room as oppose too 2 we found we had too use the same towel twice once upon arrival and also again in the morning
 poor quality bread
 for a luxury double room found the bathroom a little small the overbath shower a little awkward for my wife to access if we visit again would request a room with walk in shower 
 room was very very very small nothing like the pictures on web site view of housing complex next door no in room coffee making facilities 
 no plug facilities in bathroom for straighteners wasn t good as the only mirror in bedroom was inside the wardrobe door and the electrical socket was to far away to use the mirror also the lighting in the room wasn t so good a mirror at the side wall beside to would be good to access socket and use straightners
 infrastructure is pretty and nostalgic but in practical use sometimes really old e g the windows did not close properly and there was noise from a part in the courtyard 
 the staff apart from the initial receptionist who was new were gruff and appeared unhappy they seemed more interested in the more stereotypical looking hotel guests whom they were polite and less gruff too than they were to me 
 the ac was not functioning mini bar was hot
 restaurant pictures was good but choice of dishes and wines not in relation with class of hotel quality of food was still very good
 the room i had was noisy but a great size
 the letter in our room said enjoy what was in the fridge which was empty lol lovely to be upgraded as was my birthday treat
 beautiful design but not always practical in use
 the room was very small the wallpaper was peeling off at some points 
 sky bar closes early breakfast limited and very expensive of paying list price
 very expensive overpriced room small room
 absolutely nothing
 we had booked superior rooms but they were unavailable however the hotel gave complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine 
 breakfast could have been included
 air conditioning was not good elevator and lobby were very hot 
 nothing
 little too far main attractions and difficult to get there by public transport
 room too small
 paying for parking even though we was guests the exterior is shabby we had a long walk and two lifts to our rooms our room was dark with very little lighting in the room no air con could not open the windows very shabby bathroom the light on the dressing table did not work so had to get ready with very dim light no beer in the bar and the wine was awful the garden was a mess with napkins on the floor tables not cleared no table service guest asleep at one table noise of refurb across the whole hotel alarms going off very poor breakfast when we came down there was very little food on the counters once we had finished our breakfast they had restocked greasy cheap sausages cheap bread just very poor quality all round from a 4 star could not wait to leave 3 star at best 
 some staff very friendly others not very 
 the tea room over price tea scone 26 00 no cream tea was cold complained but nothing was done staff not helpful in the hotel
 the breakfast could have been nicer with a better selection of food and we had to ask for green tea 
 all good
 room was old tired curtains falling off tiny poor
 you can t take a shower without wetting the whole bathroom floor
 would have liked tea coffee making facilities in the room 
 nothing
 the streets around the hotel are fairly quiet but the room had very little in terms of sound insulation and vienna like any city can be noisy even early in the morning 
 need to change the carpet urgently also more professional printed materials most paper signage ex wifi password phone signage etc was printed in house on normal paper 
 little small but only slight negative i can think of 
 size of room
 internet connection is very poor surprisingly bad and slow wifi for the developed world 
 a bit outside the city 15 min tram to get to central station
 the price expensive
 wi fi connection slow lifts dark attic room at the 5th floor
 card reader in the lift difficult
 room a little tight no refrigerator in room
 hard bed no amenities replacement 
 the only thing minor is that the floors of the room was wooden which you can hear people in every neighbor rooms while walking with shoes
 liked everything
 this hotel is a cool hipster place smack bang in the middle of trendy hoxton shoreditch it is noisy in the extreme friday saturday the reception bar areas were more of a nightclub with a dj playing from early on make sure your room is high up or away from the reception areas at all costs otherwise like me you will be requesting a room move at 10 30 at night which they did accommodate because of the noise 
 we stayed in room 152 and unfortunately it seemed there was a problem with the heating the room was very cold we did ask for it to be looked at which i believe it was but it stopped again suing the night which made it not enjoyable 
 the room and bed was ridiculously small with no space to put bags etc would have been fine for a single traveler but no good for two 
 we failed connect to the wifi
 there are stairs inside the room it is two story not good for older people after a long flight 
 price of breakfast 24 for full breakfast was too much
 no linen change except on second last day which we then refused as a waste of time had to ask for more toilet paper tissues and dishwasher tablets new towels weren t where they said not sure if this was a language problem though
 rooms are a bit on the small size but this is paris after all 
 the room was near to the boulevard and the windows didn t stop any noise also you could hear the noise from all the rooms around 
 price too high and junior suite was not on suite level as was promised 
 that i had to leave
 our room was very small the tv was in an alcove which meant that it could only be viewed from one position poor planning it was also noisy but that s to be expected on a main street 
 the room was small and cold with a terrible view out of the window and wooden curtains
 staff couldn t speak english very well and quite rude huffed and puffed at us a few times whilst checking in which i thought was very rude
 not having bottled water in the room 
 the cleaners don t stop knocking on your door and waking you up and isn t nice when you have busy day ahead of you in london 
 the facilities were bad refrigerator is not working and bad bed
 we weren t able to open the window of our room due to fire security measures we would ve liked a little bit of fresh air in the room the mattress in our room was a little uncomfortable the springs in the middle were weakened from use 
 curtains were dusty bed and bath linen very poor quality bed was uncomfortable and gave me back ache tea and coffee was a bit lack lustre how do you expect a person to make a decent cup of tea with small uh t milk only one large bath towel provided for two people does this mean only one person can shower walls were very thin i could hear the gentlemen next door snoring
 a little train noise due to location near euston but one of those things
 we stayed for years but it is not great value for money and my car wasn t delivered when it had been rewuested
 it was not clean enough 
 only gripe i d have is hotel room window was facing a wall of building site didn t bother us too much as we were out all day 
 wifi didn t work properly but it worked controlling the lights in the room was a little difficult 
 just would ve loved to have more time in the executive lounge and just that they would ve remembered my request about it being out anniversary 
 the toilet malfunctioned on the last day reported to reception and they promised to sort it out it was not anyone s making but it was frustrating a bit 
 small rooms no coffee available sat night as machine was being cleaned bar staff were miserable
 air con was hard to use
 the room was tiny 
 we waited almost 2 hours for room service after complaining to the staff multiple times when we received our food they still got the order wrong it was also impossible to call in our order as no one would pick up the phone hence we had to go to the reception to order 
 some rooms don t have a curtain between shower and bed room some like it some dont 
 the bathroom is part of the room which is very annoying i really urge the hotel to reconsider having the bathroom like this if you want to wash your face you will get the whole floor wet because of the small sink you can t use the bathroom because your have zero privacy
 service breakfast
 the room is way smaller than i expected the breakfast is fair 
 no a c in the room the truth is that it was not mentioned but i couldn t imagine there was no a c in a 4 3 3 5 mins walk from the closest metro stop 
 less choice at breakfast but better food
 no info on website regarding building work luckily not at hotel during day but if i had i would have been annoyed distance to nearest tube station was about a mile too far time in london is too precious 
 hotel very run down fixtures and fittings hanging of walls very noisy from outside aircon staff tried to put off from food pizza was burnt worst thistle that we have stayed in and we stay a lot
 blinds didn t block out all the light from the street lots of leds in the room ex from tv and ac that were on at night 
 shower was only average but otherwise ok
 unfortunately we do not agree with some of the other reviews we specifically asked for a quiet room and we got the opposite they gave us room number 12 on the first floor unluckily we did not sleep a lot you can hear the metro passing underneath the hotel you can even feel the vibrations it makes an irritating palpitating noise we could also hear every step and sneeze from the upstairs neighbors the breakfast room is too small for the hotel and a bit claustrophobic for us this is a better 3 star definitely not a 4 
 small room no bath but this is central paris
 we were put off breakfast because of the price and also think the parking is expensive also we had a shower head in our room which wasn t working properly and the lighting in the shower room isn t really sufficient 
 nothing
 bathroom was very tight and separate from shower
 nothing 
 the room was a smoking room didn t like that they say it was not but strong cigarette smell also found a few dirty spots in the room didn t like that 
 receptionists need to develop their social skills and graces in welcoming and informing foreign visitors 
 some unexpected costs of the minibar 
 location breakfast elevator smell tram noise the sloping roof ceiling of my room the price i paid is too much for what i got in return had to use the taxi to go almost anywhere 
 the squeaky sound from the wooden floor should be fixed it disturbs guest below 
 a breakfast at a sensible price would be better
 only thing that we didnt like was the cost of alcohol but it was the same everywhere in london
 room was smaller and less plush than we had anticipated for the price paid
 staff on reception wasn t good on arrival she blatantly lied to my face and took 50 off my card as a deposit to then be told by another member of staff when leaving that it wasn t necessary not happy
 nothing
 small rooms old hotel cold no heating in bathroom in winter equals freezing 
 sometimes a little bit loud outside but not bad 
 no towel rails by sink the sink is too small 
 couldn t fault the hotel at all only negative is there were a lot of mosquitos in the room and we were both bitten quite badly while asleep of a night but nothing a bit of antiseptic can t fix 
 restaurant undercooked steak even after sending it back was still undercooked left balance as it wasn t to my liking
 nothing 
 i expectd the room to be a bit more spacious but its definitely fine 
 the a c are too nooosey it doesn t get cool we complained several times but no body responded the tv s was also not working for the whole week in one of the rooms second room it was auto operating couldn t get it off some of the rooms had bad smell 
 rooms are small but still it is very well designed 
 my colleagues arrived at breakfast before i did so it wasn t noticed when i joined them and it was hard to get the attention of the server for coffee the pancakes were cold even under the warming unit but breakfast was otherwise very good 
 while they did do a good job with the interior decor the architectural planning is lacking the walls are paper thin so expect to find out about your neighbor s snoring bathroom and closet habits more than you d like and falling asleep is a bit of an ordeal wish the wifi connection was more secure private the bed throw had a four inch stain of what can only be described as dry gunk not the type of substance you want to see on your bed when you walk into your room they could pay more attention to that sort of detail 
 balconies could be improved our king room did not have a city view as stated however we were upgraded on the second third nights at no extra cost to us also as we were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary we were greeted in our room with a lovely bottle of champagne 2 boxes of macaroons this was a lovely touch on the hotel s behalf 
 coffee could have been warmer out if the machine 
 double bed a bit small 
 could be more luxurious
 we buy from the reception two tickets for the sagrada famiglia with 35 euro instead of 30 the normal price and when we went to visit it because of the hotel we had to wait for almost 1 hour to get in because our ticket wasn t good was already validate i am still here waiting under the sun for them to rezolve the problem 
 terribly small rooms i had booked it for my daughter with her little boy and husband but when the booking completed it was booked as a double room they had to move to a basement room with no windows 
 i stil wait for the returning of the reservation from mijn credicard we are now 3 days later also from staybridge suites newcastel 6 days later 
 there is nothing not to like trust me 
 the noise the hotel is situated on a busy street and i was woken up several times during the night due to glass collections refuse collections and wailing sirens 
 there is no room service when i asked for taxi they asked my to come down before they order me a taxi i asked for iron they told me come down and collect the iron the stuff not that friendly at all and they don t know who to deal with customers i was speaking with the receptionist and in the middle of our talking she picked up the phone while i m talking 
 hotel was a lot bigger and busier than i d envisaged so many american tour group making check in queue too long not good in a hotel at this price also our 1 bed suite felt over designed i e too much pointless oversized furniture glass coffee table but not enough storage ridiculously small wardrobe and as for the lighting come on guys over complicated too dark and nobody needs a red night light in the bathroom 
 tiny rooms barely had room to open my suitcase ridiculous tiny elevator that is also very slow the hallways are so narrow that two people can barely pass if one is pulling a large suitcase poor value for money from what i heard from other travelers 
 only small comment i left my room around 12 00 on tge last day and my taxi came around 16 00 so there was plantly of time for cleaning staff to notice that i left behind a sleeping bag of my child and to notify me that s all 
 we were not able to access our room until 16 45 but the reception staff did offer free drinks etc by way of apology 
 nothing
 no concerns 
 slight noise from door to lift during night but we were in and end room 130 
 i lost my scarf i ask the concerg to check with the housekeeping and it was pointless i lost it
 wifi so slow
 when i arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before i booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done all the lovely garden had been tourn up then the next morning i got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so that s probably why i wouldn t stay at hotel arena again i was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full english breakfasts 
 shower was barely tepid no heating in bathroom shower door stuck 
 room wasn t ready at 2 15pm fianc e had to change in the toilet on arrival 
 nothing really
 no hot water for the duration of my stay and no form of compensation offered although the staff were friendly it didn t make up for a freezing shower in the morning the internet provided was horrendously slow and pointless even trying to connect 
 furniture was old the plates were not clean
 hard pillows 
 poor service from staff pre paid for hotel but charged a 60 deposit without being told on arrival room was very hot staff were not particularly helpful english wasn t great housekeeper walked into room at 9 30am without knocking the day before she didn t come until 4pm stale orange juice by the pool area small room with almost no wardrobe space and no drawers or cupboards for clothes poor value for money 
 bathrobes were taken away once used but not replaced toiletries were not replaced with fresh ones 
 bar prices were quite high
 slight rumble of trains heard shower head a bit wobbly
 too much heat in rooms 
 the cleaning woman loudly slammed the doors many times 
 being charged for wifi 
 breakfast below average limited choice 
 nothing 
 shower space is children size and room is very small for 4 standard 
 mattress on the beds are too soft parking place with terrible smell
 large gap under door meant it was quite noisy despite being a corner room
 they took our towels without giving us new ones you could practically hear what the guest on the other side of the wall were talking about 
 the room cleaning team got tired after the third day of our stay and only changed some towels 
 nothing
 you have to wait for a long time if you asked for a thing from the housekeeping
 the room was tiny and rather shabby clearly very old the usb charger point didn t work the shower was leaky the air con noisy 
 the hotels restaurant for the evening meal
 the breakfast in the executive lounge could have been better by having hash browns so that a full english breakfast could be eaten and more choice of cereals 
 nothing it was amazing 
 service at breakfast
 an extra armchair would have been appreciated however there was a desk chair that we utilised other than that excellent 
 no bbc world and no cnn unfortunately slow lift
 it was like living in victoria station during rush hours constant queues for lifts reception and even breakfast slow internet connection room service beginning to work at 8 am due to a huge number of rooms on each floor of course doors were not sound proof thanks but no thanks 
 the coffee at breakfast terrible 
 nothing all great
 the hospitality and the treat of the receptionist 
 suggestion a full length mirror would be an added bonus my wife wanted to see her image with regard to dressing ready for the buckingham palace garden party otherwise everything was excellent 
 the air conditioning in the room was freezing cold no more hot air 
 nothing to do with hotel but the access to the hotel and london traffic sucks
 thought it was on the expensive side
 no restaurant
 nothing 
 rooms a little bit shabby
 i didn t like that the junior suite was so good that we didn t like to go outside for sightseeing 
 nothing but describe as quality rather than luxury
 the food in the lounge
 n a
 room was small but as it was only myself ot wasnt a problem also the water in the shower was incredibly hot and very difficult to get a happy medium but that is being very picky
 nothing
 the restaurant but that s only because it was too warm and a little shabby
 breakfast cold buffet selection of food and hot drinks from a hot water urn 
 second time we stayed in this hotel first time our room was much bigger and nicer so point it out when you book 
 hotel needs to be cleaned from top yo toe tv would only change channel if i switched off and on all the time they offer room service but dont use it its microwaved food mine arrived frozen still they should be advertising as a 3 star 
 the building doen t have a nice view
 room wasn t ready until 1530
 we had a car so it was no big issue for us but the hotel is in an industrial area which is not very well connected to the city by public transportation 
 when we arrived our rooms where mixed they changed them both rooms were supposed to be double rooms but one was prepared as a single room we asked for second pillous and towels but it took the staff about 6 hours to get those to the room i had to ask them twice to do it 
 
 internet is very poor needs a lot of work 
 bed for 3rd person only really suitable for child
 the bedroom was too hot without the air conditioning on the air conditioning too loud to sleep through we had to ask each day for shampoos etc as they were never replenished the food was very nice but the penny pinching items eg pancakes at an extra cost seemed petty given how expensive the stay was we had to book to use the spa pool 
 neighborhood not great to go out at night
 be prepared for the usual tiny corridors tiny lift small rooms 
 nothing all was good maybe they could use 2 people at the reception desk instead if only one especially on weekends takes a bit too long and staff not always familiar with direction to tourists attractions
 small room wouldn t class as 4star hotel lobby is lovely but rooms arent great beds were heavily scratched corridors were noisy you have to physically lock the door with your key on the inside which poses a fire risk rooms were stuffy the most annoying thing was that they had made my bed up in a twin room under a wall lamp that i must of hit my head off a dozen times in the 2 nights i stayed because they intellegently placed the light directly above your head in the perfect spot to hit it sitting up or getting out of bed what away to start the morning with a little light concussion 
 why have a bar in the hotel and don t open it big disappointment to us not having this facility open 
 the whole place feels tired and in desperate need of a refurbishment it looks like nothing has changed since it opened 14 years ago when i first stayed there the carpets furniture and bathrooms are worn out scratched and damaged the internet is expensive and the breakfast hour 8 to 9 is often very crowded i only stay at the hotel because it is next door to my head office 
 room needs a facelift and windows need cleaning and painting
 had to change and pay extra for a superior room if i wanted air conditioning was expecting ac to be included foc
 room was a little dark and hanging space for clothes very limited lighting in the room was bad especially where you were supposed to put your clothes it lacked character in the rooms 
 nothing 
 room was a little small but this is to be expected in london
 if there would be triple rooms to include a child
 the breakfast room was very crowded on sunday after 9 15 the staff at the reception warned us about this arriving at 8 45 everything was fine
 nothing
 the double bed was two singles pushed together and the gap was slightly problematic 
 good variety of quality toiletries but cotton pads and sticks would be appreciated 
 we wanted to hire an iron from reception and they do not have any they would however send our shirts out to be ironed also the aircon didn t work although we stayed in january and shouldn t need it we did luckily our room had a lovely balcony so it wasn t too much of a problem 
 second hand smoke smell
 if you want modern rooms and a big elevator with a bar and restaurant to hang out in this isn t for you 
 had paid for a single room got two single beds pushed together all my other friend s had double beds
 the facilities
 badly smell air conditioning we needed to stop it and to open the windows during hours
 unwelcoming disaffected reception staff 
 bathrooms cramped rooms small but location was superb
 i was sick and asked them for the nearest pharmacy but they sent me to a pharmacy which they thought was open late but found out was only true during weekends it certainly needs a furnisher upgrade excellent location 
 should of spent more than a weekend here 
 the bath has been full of someones hair but we were too late back in the hotel to move from room to room or call somebody that time however we did communicate that to the hotel staff in the morning 
 did not like pillows uncomfortable to sleep on 
 mattress should be an upscale serta with topper parking was hugely expensive and with no available slots so we got from outside a parking fine during the weekend plus the parking 42 euros the requests in the b com reservation were totally ignored and they ve tried to downgrade us by mistake 
 misleading room description led me to think it was a better bigger room terminology on booking doesn t match the hoxton website booking said it was a discounted deal but was actually 10 more than on the hotels own website early check in wasn t possible but only found out on arrival asked for a room on a higher floor but when we got back at 22 30 we were given a 1st floor room asked if the restaurant was still open and excited it was dropped bags off came down only to be told it was closed told no room service asked how we could get food only to be given a dominoes menu mattress on the bed was soft thin the bed squeaked with every turn in the night really was a stay of style over substance wouldn t stay in a cosy double again 
 serious construction was being done at the front of hotel rooms shouldn t have been given out as there banging made it impossible to rest this information should have been given out before 
 during check in they blocked 50 on my card without telling me in advance breakfast is quite overpriced 
 car park lift was broken and it took a long time to check in as only two members of staff on the front desk 
 mattress could have been more comfortable but this is always subjective all in all the stay was great 
 the location although extremely central and convenient is too touristy and one night we ordered room service that never showed up also we stayed in two different rooms as we checked out and decided to stay another night last minute one on the 4th floor was quiet and amazing and the one on the 1st floor facing the street was too loud 
 price is a bit high but considering the season is completely normal
 small rooms
 not having to change rooms after 1 night key cards that work 6 times they did not works and 3 times no lights in the room shower not working correctly for the first 3 days
 coffee was not of good quality at breakfast rooms are very tiny i paid for an executive room but didn t see any difference between that and a small bedroom shower a fixed head and not very powerful 
 the bed was to hard 
 was a really hot weekend and unfortunately the air con didn t seem to be cooling the room much so was very stuffy also where the large mirror in the room was there was no light so couldn t see much 
 everything was perfect enjoyed our stay 
 it would nice to have
 why free internet is only available for members it s not right 
 no space
 no tea coffee making facilities in the room 
 room service prices were very expensive the tray charge alone was 20 euros 
 the other staff at check in were really bad
 there was damage to our bathroom door when we arrived but the staff resolved this issue very quickly
 water is only provided on the first day i don t think its a big issue but wifi disconnects every now and then and everytime its required to re enter the username and password to login again i would also recommend to add a door to the shower area for more privacy and to avoid the spilling of water which could ultimately damage the wooden flooring this is not criticism just an advice 
 rooms on atrium side are quite noisy
 high ceilings windows couldn t open fully 
 nothing 
 more teabags in the room staff were very busy on checkout but still helpful 
 the lights in the room were a little confusing there was a nack to working out how to turn on the one you wanted without turning them all off or the one across the room on early check in or late check out wasn t really an option or at least not made clear 
 breakfast both mornings had nothing left it took a long time to replenish anything and it was after i had to find a staff member to do it they seemed very stressed in the mornings 
 open wi fi slow and not save network i got a very small room too tight
 room cleaning staff
 it was a special occasion my wifes 50th birthday on 10 10 15 yet they delivered her cake on arrival 9 10 15 also was told i could check in at 14 00 but room was not ready till 5pm also noise of trains going by night and day was extremely disappointing as it was a one in a million trip for me and my wife total waste of 1500 for a very special weekend 
 water temperature very inconsistent in showers 
 the lack of help from staff everything we asked was passed on to someone else and never dealt with which caused stress to our stay the second day was the morning of the london marathon at breakfast there wasn t anything out at 7am despite people wanting to leave early we had to wait and ask for everything and it wasn t even busy the spa is a grubby sauna and a tiny swimming pool
 the lack of a sitting room or similar where we could sit with our family and chat it took us a while to realise that we could use the restaurant for this as it doubled up as a bar and meeting area 
 pool extrely shallow but few locations on milan have pools 
 spa facilities not working for duration of stay we were looking forward to chilling in spa gym very small
 be warned to slip in the bathroom after the shower because of extra oils on soap
 coffee could have been hotter at breakfast 
 location
 expensive restaurant undisclosed 100 fee refundable needed at check in this is not stated anywhere on any part of the booking process or confirmation 
 the personal belongings disappear from the room the party in the restaurant went till 0130 am and the sound proofing in the room couldn t handle it there is no clear info warning how to get to the hotel on the day of the local sporting events due to closure of the local roads 
 rooms are small strictly business no decor but comfortable 
 no parking which is understandable given the location but i feel you should offer free parking for customers at the recommended ncp down the road also everyone loves a little freebie from a hotel mini toiletries spoils the fun to sell the same products at reception i don t go to a hotel to shop 
 the dlr noise was disturbing at some point
 too expensive should at least have a breakfast included
 poor breakfast side plates had to be used for hot breakfast no hot plates had to ask for further plates and knives for toast no marmalade staff too busy talking
 driving into milan 
 i wasnt happy that i had to pay 15 for parking as a guest who is already paying for a nights stay that should change to be free for guests 
 expensive breakfast quite far from city center 
 city tax 10 euros
 we booked for 2 singles and got a double room the free wifi did not work across the 2 days every time we had to go to reception we had to queue for at least 10 15 minutes 
 the only thing that would have made a difference was that there was no coffee available in the bedroom 
 room smaller than expected bathroom toilet very very small
 my single room was a bit small 
 rooms are quite old needs to be refreshed staff were not aware that the rooms are not connecting rooms as systems showed that they were
 hotel is so good excellent service 
 location
 the hotel is dated the carpet full of stains and the furniture and bathroom tatty there was a mix up when i checked in as the booking system had picked up another person with the same name this was too much for the receptionist to comprehend if this hotel had not been heavily discounted i would have been very disappointed 
 i didn t appreciate the fact that the hotel wanted to bloc 50 pounds every day in case of using the mini bar and we booked a room for 4 and that wasn t mentionned on their booking finally we got a room but is this professionnal i also regret that the staff wasn t able to give us informations about london bus breakfast except the only concierge 
 better spa services
 needed more power pounts lights in the room fridge did not work would be nice to have a bottle of water in the room daily 
 the facility
 rooms are small
 needs a nicer lounge bar area
 nothing like the level of cleanliness renovation fixtures fittings and comfort you would expect at this price point lift size capacity speed and noise suggesting imminent breakdown worn paneling in the bathroom no toilet brush communicating with some staff in english was not so easy 
 staff at check out and check in could have been friendlier 
 lack of front door service and not being able to use the bar or restaurant in the evening due to the tv show recording wasn t made aware beforehand 
 bathroom a little on the small side but was not a problem for us
 three days after stay discover 50 still withheld by hotel have phoned twice at the cost of 13pence min still waiting for a call back
 dilapidated walls and scratched in room 215 when booking room picture with a large window standard room when at the hilton metropole they give you a room where in the window big gray wall 
 a little out of the way from the main tourist areas easy enough to get a train to the main city area but not much to do in the area of the hotel itself in fact nothing at all to do so be prepared to travel to the city for entertainment and food etc 
 nothing
 the noises from the people in the hotel in the night
 would welcome daily replenishment of bathroom supplies
 air conditioner not cool enough 
 the weather could have been better but that is something we have no control over it did not affect our holiday still enjoyed barcelona 
 the door not locking
 the price was quite high for a small room and the internet was hopeless 
 long wait at check in
 nothing
 the tables for the breakfast in the restaurant room inside were not sufficient for the gests so we had to move outside and there was a little bit humidity in the garden in the morning 
 as i had paid 880 euros for 3 nights with no breakfast included i felt this was overpriced as we were in the second block of the building and i felt when you are in this block nobody cares and you are not important enough breakfast is far too overpriced at 30 euros per person upon check in considering my reservation was already 880 euros the room was also very tired looking in my eyes not 5 star i cannot comment on the staff as i was not met with any of them apart from check in and check out 
 no iron in the room the cleaning services glass walls in the room
 none
 can t think of anything that i didn t like 
 they rejected to give me big bin watch view unless i pay 40 pound per nigh
 the room is too small the air conditioner in our room did not work they changed our rooms and the other aircon was not working neither we had to ask for a fan the breakfast was expensive and disappointing 
 the first room the heating didn t work but we were moved to a new room
 breakfast excpensive
 more english tv channels would be a nice addition 
 i stayed for three nights and the bar was closed for renovations on two of those nights no mention of this little nugget when i booked by the way luckily there was a decent pub over the road also no free wifi in the rooms is a no no just because the building is a couple if centuries old doesn t mean the facilities have to be 
 the room is not huge but spacious enough 
 no complaints although i would say it is borderline 4 stars no safe in room 
 we had to pay for hotel parking old decor that is beaten it was a 4 star hotel some time ago but not sure this is the case anymore 
 the bed was a little too european meaning i am not a duvet type of person and a 4 inch thick matrass on top of a canvas covered matrass and box spring with the smaller matrass slipping off of the other matrass mean you have to slide it back on to the bed in the middle of the night 
 downstairs was being refurbished so no breakfast or bar when we stayed 
 expensive for the rooms confort and size
 the rooms are expensive especially for a family the price should include the breakfast and the car park you can get the same breakfast for half the price at local restaurants as for paying guests having to pay for car parking is just wrong when the rooms are so expensive its just getting extra from people because of location 
 staff could be a little friendlier eye contact and a smile never hurt anyone localisation is a little bit far from any sites of interest but that also spares you the traffic jams in and out of milan 
 the wi fi requires connection through facebook and this is really molesting 
 there was absolutely nothing i didn t like about jaz it was perfect 
 the triple room only had a fold up bed
 the bed was a bit too soft i woke up with a bit of a backache 
 the street is very noisy impossible to sleep the conditioner did not work and someone was smoking so all the smoke went into my room the worse experience i ever had would not reccomend this hotel to anyone 
 no lift but not mentioned on web
 the drinks in the bar were very pricy and we were over charged but did not realise till to late
 bed was very lumpy
 breakfast not that great 
 nothing
 staff could have been more helpful we were charged differently to what our quote said struggled with getting the receptionist to understand
 the toiletries seem to leave a layer of moisture lubricant around the skin causing one to feel like it is never completely cleaned off either that or there is something wrong with the water that comes from the tap shower it is the same for the bathtub where possibly because of the water or toiletries always feels slippery when it becomes wet this could be a unique experience though finally it is a pity that bottled waters are not offered in the room though this shortfall is further exacerbated by a leaking kettle 
 nothing it was perfect
 no real bar for a nightcap and was served bitter lemon instead of lemonade 
 a few more t bags and milk but to be fair it only took a phone call to reception for more in an instant traffic noise 
 65 for a simple breakfast for 2 was a bit rich
 no wash face clothes were given you had to request everyday the carpet needed shampooing thus discarded completely the elevators were small and dysfunctional 
 staff a little reserved 
 super noisy
 breakfast is very expensive if you pay over 130 for a night then it should be for free unexpected city tax which was not included to the price that was in booking com it was small amount in euro but still i prefer to pay the final price that was in booking com 
 in general the amenities were expensive room service parking and breakfast is rather high also the parking lot is rather far about a 6 minute walk to the hotel 
 only complaint was not hotel s fault wifi network was out we ll be back though 
 my single room is a little small do not have space to open a luggage case properly
 double bed consisting of 2 separate matresses not what i d expected in a junior suite
 no milk in room on arrival disappointed with breakfast quality and service
 the color of the doors rose and the smell of the room
 room not very modern for price paid 
 tv channels all in spanish language except the french arabic news 
 i couldn t get to sleep all night as our heating did not work
 it was too far from the center of milan the taxi was too expensive there was no shuttle to take you to the airport 
 
 the room was too warm and opening a window was no option because of the noise
 the staff were not at all welcoming i would go so far as to say jaded if not unhappy at obe point seen arguing with a customer in front of customers the double bed i selected wasn t a double bed at all but two single beds zipped together and very poorly and uncomfortably at that so cheap such a bad sleep there were mice scurrying around all over the property in full view of customers from the main lobby to near the dining and bar areas to inside my room where i saw mice on two occasions during my stay the room itself had too much wear and tear with walls visibly stained marked and damaged and the toilets showing mould in the shower totally careless i asked for a non smoking room but the room i got reeked of smoke everywhere from the curtains to the toilet so bad i want a full refund 
 the wifi connection in my room was a bit poor 
 the buffet for breakfast but it was good 
 no wine glasses in the room
 the bed wasn t as comfortable as we would have expected that was about the only thing we felt could have been improved 
 i can not think about one thing that i did not like everything was great 
 air conditioning could be better
 the bed was incredibly uncomfortable we basically didn t sleep for three nights
 all good
 it was noisy i mean the sound of the ambulance and the police cars is so loud and you will hear it at least 7times at night the room space is quit small for 3 people
 shower being cold sonthry refunded us one nights accommodatiin
 car park cost room tired
 nothing
 if an item was moved from the minibar it had to be paid for
 nothing
 only restaurant
 being stuck next to lift shaft plastic cups etc paying over the odds
 easier access to getting cases into or out of hotel without using strange disability lift 
 rooms need a refurb looking tired 
 the rooms didnt have any equipments to make tea or coffee the main restuarant was closed during the month of august 
 nothing 
 staff is too arrogant to handle totally money minded if you are agitated and not cool minded and they will snatch your pocket literally they sell u from taxis to tv channels holiday inn operator need to retrain their staff i believe mind you this location is 1 hour from effile tower by any transport 
 only being able to use an elevator to get to the room i ll be honest the room was tiny but that is just london for you we had everything we needed 
 i did not like the pillows on the bed not comfortable at all 
 the breakfast definitely doesn t correspond to a four star hotel maybe in italy or for people who like numerous cake for breakfast 
 the male staff at the front desk were no as friendly very straight faced and rushed i would have like brighter lighting in my room the room took a long time to warm up also my room service try was outside my door over night 
 no drugs
 nothing
 bar so busy nowhere to sit food not very good over priced 
 it s expensive for a cosy sized room it s a high cost option 
 no negatives
 careless staff and not reliable i asked them twice to confirm which credit card will be dedited the one debited in the end was not the one i was told reception guys also don t answer their phone you can here noises from other rooms such as tv phones etc 
 breakfast was a little expensive 
 we got upgraded but got given the standard room key and didn t have time to say anything before we went out they asked us if wr would like to move to the upgraded room when we got back at 12am and our standard room key wouldn t work 
 evening meal disappointing overpriced but probably normal for large city 
 nothing not to like 
 double bed was actually two separate singles pushed together one of us ended up sleeping on the crack between the mattresses and the beds kept sliding apart 
 i cannot fault anything
 nothing
 check in could have been better as we were waiting past the 2pm check in time as our room wasn t ready 
 none everything was perfect during our stay
 lack of provisions per person in room housekeeping knocking door at 8 30 on a saturday morning wanting to know when its convenient to refresh room wasn t appreciated
 i liked pretty much everything about the venue and the rooms except when i arrived and was trying to check in it was my first time travelling solo i had changed all my money to euro and had most of it in cash i assumed there won t be any issues using cash and it will help me keep good track of my spending i had everything in check except the travel agent booking com failed to inform me that the hotel only allows checking in with cards i had arrived at the hotel at 22 00 and i no banks were open my only option was to contact my parents back in london to transfer money to my account they did and it was quite a hassle because i had to call my bank and have it sorted out it was such a hassle and such a nuisance i have to point out that aside from that i did enjoy my stay it was clean quiet and the rooms are unique so it gave me a pleasant new experience 
 1 not fancy so fancy room as the picture 2 cleaners broke cell phone cable and left there as if nothing happened
 trains tracks out side window and air conditioning all night
 the hotel should be more careful on the money that guests might be lose with hotel s mistake 
 aost perfect just a warning they re isn t a huge vegetarian cooked breakfast options no vegi sausages but there is lots if choice for other breakfast things so it s not a problem
 didn t much like breakfast choices
 honestly there was nothing that could have been improved upon in my opinion 
 sound travelled between rooms more than in some hotels
 room are pretty small
 nothing
 bad location poor hotel for price air conditioning just did not work generally felt uncomfortable i rarely comment but this hotel just did not deliver at all so felt compelled to review 
 the hotel was classified as 4 star we felt that it was lucky to be 3 star 
 people in adjacent room very loud most hotels could improve their sound reductions 
 the room is small 
 parking in amsterdam is expensive and the hotel doesn t provide parking cheapest we could find was 20 euros per day free sunday s this was quite a long walk from the hotel 
 breakfast food was not the greatest considering the price hotel seems a bit pricy overall all things considered i would probably look for someplace a bit less expensive next time 
 nothing
 booked a double bed room for 2 nights with balcony and eiffel tower view on arrival i was told that this room is too small for 1 adult and 3 small children i got a bigger room for an additional charge of 80 euros per night this room was featuring one double bed no balcony and facing the backyard although dissapointed with one sleeping and two crying kids i decided to stay the first night and cancel the second the receiptionist agreed and showed me the cancelation on her computer she said she would transfer the money back on the next day however during checkout i was informed that they never do refunds and will keep the money certainly my last stay at this chain 
 room was very dated worn stained furniture
 bathroom dirty and poorly designed towels hung over toilet nowhere to hang hand towel for sink bath had hairs in on arrival waste pipe behind which could be clearly seen when showering very thick with dust shower too close to wall and head not removable like something out of the 80 s 
 nothing
 the bed wasn t great 
 i had sent a message asking for an early check in shortly after i made the booking i didn t hear from the hotel but assumed that it would be ok when it came to it i wasn t able to check in early which was a bit annoying as we would have liked to freshen up before a long afternoon and evening at a hyde park concert next time i would contact the hotel directly with any requests although our room was very nice and well designed it was in the basement with a view of a brick wall 
 rude staff at breakfast noisy rooms with dlr and airport around the corner outdated interior facilities 
 pancakes were not available half of our stay the room is already showing signs of wear one day the room wasn t cleaned no matter we put on the sign for the whole day 
 the small rooms really are small 
 they give me smoking room which i did not request 
 since amba took over the hotel has been stripped of all its character and homogenised to look like all the other amba hotels brand amba what a shame 
 breakfast was quite expensive if need to buy individually but good quality 
 labyrinth feeling
 service is just so so
 nothing 
 nothing
 bed was abit small
 food wasnt great
 was bit cold in the room
 the quality of the food at the bank restaurant just not good enough the zander bar does great cocktails but the music is too loud and doesn t help create a friendly relaxing atmosphere 
 the staff 
 you can not open the window in the room since the refurbishment so the room gets very warm 
 my colleague left behind some slippers by mistake but when we called to get them collected nobody had found them disappointing also restaurant in the hotel was quite expensive 
 nothing
 the room 
 i booked a room with two beds for myself and colleague at first we were given a key card to a room that had someone else sleeping in the second room we were given had a double bed in we left to get food whilst they sorted it out and when we returned we were given a new room but told to go and collect all our bags from the old trim and take them ourselves to the new room the customer service was terrible 
 the breakfast was included in our price but it wasn t great there was a hot option of scrambled eggs which my daughter had and said was ok but the croissants were more like bread than traditional french flaky and orange juice had never seen a fresh orange 
 i did not like the fraud that they committed on my card the day i arrived do not go here 
 i had a first floor room giving on the main street and have to admit i needed some time to ignore some level of noise and vibration created by the passage of the trams 
 everything was perfect
 i cannot refund my last night of stay i had a change in plan but because it was prepaid through booking com i cannot refund it can booking com give me back a credit
 said swimming pool on booking com this doesn t have a pool spa is always overbooked rooftop bar doesn t open sunday mondays and this was the day i booked and i wasn t informed this was the case 
 breakfast too expensive 17 euros
 the breakfast wasn t worth the money at all bread was good but eggs and bacon tasted like nothing 
 room was a bit on the expensive side but we appreciate it was in an expensive part of the city 
 poor services
 room 801 small noisy avoid some staff rude not a 5 star or worth the money 
 nothing
 i have been charged twice on my debit card once when i checked in and the second time after check out i stayed form 26 sept to 4 october name is eric a room 932 i would greatly appreciate if the first debit is reversed thanks 
 bathroom needs renovation child bed was broken but still usable and we were grateful we could use it 
 the ensuite required some maintenance as the basin tap produced only a small trickle of water even at max not that impressed when this hotel is rated as five star 
 only had epresso mugs but supplied tea in room neither of us drank coffee could hear a noise during night which kept me awake like a droning noise 
 the location is 10 minutes walk from the nearest metro still takes about 15 20 minutes to get to the centre of london if you like shopping 
 nothing thanx 
 larger and more luxurious bathroom
 lobby getting in and out of hotel
 a bit of a walk from the duomo metro stop 10 12 mins but if you re taking taxis it s ok 
 nothing of any serious nature 
 car park space is very limited
 would have liked hot water in the shower to be slightly hotter and we seemed to have problems getting wifi but overall a great stay thank you
 the bathroom wasn t cleaned everyday properly 
 double bed mattress made out of two single mattresses
 nothing
 the bar no air con no draught beer expensive air con in room is limited to 19c and a very low fan speed room was still a high temp when sleeping could do with a pool too
 the gym is not worthy of the name gym 
 we left the hotel before 7 am and they provide us a breakfast box that was very poor and with no bread or croissant in the second night there were no cups to make coffee or tea 
 getting the right information from the front desk staff was not easy i called and inquired about how to get from the wein train station to the hotel and was told i could only get to the hotel via taxi which in fact was not the case also getting a map of vienna that was readable was non existent as the map i recieved was so hard to read it made my trip harder and more time consuming very frustrating when you have only a few days to explore 
 door keys didn t work initially room too hot and air conditioning not great window wouldn t open more than a small amount 
 liked it all
 check in procedure i had to wait until 5 pm for my room the fist room i had was a 3 hotel standard
 the internet is extremely boring u have to put a new password every 24 hours the rooms are not good isolated very noisy because of the train station quite close to the hotel
 the isolation of the walls and doors are not very good you can hear the noise from the corridor and from the rooms next door 
 the restaurant no variety of food and staff were rude wouldn t accommodate any variety and did not listen to requests
 room isn t that great average holiday inn premier inn type
 bathroom a little small and noise of air on unit outside window 
 shwer had no power and made an awful screeching sound when turned on 
 the heating doesn t work properly for the winter it was cold for me in the room 
 wi fi in the room was quite slow 
 3rd floor bedroom in attic space room ok but cramped hanging space for clothes nice bathroom but very small velux tyoe windows must be fully closed or open 
 the front desk lady was quite stiff usually the more friendly receptionists are those coming eastern europe or spain she did not give the cookies upon check in rooms are cramped 
 no lift we were on 3rd floor and 66 steps up narrow staircase 
 room quite dated old furniture and thread bare carpets needs a make over but bed very comfortable with lovely duvet and pillows great breakfast 
 noise the noise is ridiculous both on the street side 3rd floor and the square side 5th floor the noise of the traffic is incredible it s a shame since the hotel is fine but if one cannot sleep the entire visit to barcelona is ruined it s incomprehensible since many highway hotels manage to insulate the noise just fine if you want to enjoy your stay in barcelona stay someplace where you will actually be able to sleep otherwise bring some sleeping pills ear plugs and drink lots of coffee the next morning and put up with intolerable noise 
 not in the city center the double was twin bed but they put it side by side one of the receptionist hang out our phone when we were asking about why the internet is not working after we come to the receptionist she said sorry 
 being autumn the air con cooling option had been switched off the room was uncomfortably hot and very stuffy required a portable cooler which was a poor substitute no fridge at all helpful kindly staff provided one room and bathroom was generally tired and required cleaning and freshening up very familiar with ihg hotels but this one doesn t get my vote 
 bed size too small for 2 persons cushions not comfortable curtains need to be replaced improve cleanliness of facilities such as the hair dryer hose improve speed of responding to complaints 
 n a
 the mattress was soft lacked support and should be replaced the cost of breakfast quoted at 23 per person is extortionate we did not partake 
 there wasn t anything we didn t like the price for one night was higher than we like to spend but it is london so we knew what to expect 
 1 the cleaning activity washing the glasses and withing the first two days done by the tall black woman 2 not being installed the office software excel word on the laptop existing in the lobby 3 not working of some electric power sockets in my staying room no 404 
 the room was too little and the bed as well was quite short for a normal size person 
 internet connection wifi was really bad 
 the only thing was that you could hear everything that goes on in the bathroom and no call to say when check out time is as we got charged extra 
 waste 45 minutes to checking in queue no waiting seats in the lobby no extra towels and shampoos in the bath disgusting smells on the corridors
 but the porridge bit cold also noticed the jars that contained nuts were open this could trigger an allergic reaction with a person who has a serve nut allergy 
 nothing all was good 
 limited menu tight parking
 the price is high in fact
 a little out of the way
 cold bathroom 
 very drying air conditioning no opening windows bathroom had everything but a bit tired drab
 room service is week old furniture poor tv system
 just the pool water should had been warmer
 room freshner was missing carpet not cleaned eveyday no lunch
 nothing
 proper double bed rather than 2 singles put together 
 not enough snacks in minibar or still water
 the building work outside and only having 1 lift
 the pool is very small and there is an extra fee to use the hot tub 
 the bed wewe too soft the room was too small 
 rooms on street front are loudly 
 the size of the room 
 breakfast was very french too rich for american taste 
 nothing
 we paid extra for a late check out and the hotel was not considerate enough
 only drawback was that they were unable to provide wine at dinner i think there is currently some restriction on their licence 
 a little further out of the main streets then we would have liked 
 there were 6 stairs inside which was a little difficult with our suitcases
 nothing to improve wish i could ve stayed longer 
 the blinds didnt close all together so got woken up by sun in my face the wifi was weak and the tv didnt work properly the hdmi kept getting disconnected and then reconnected so not possible to watch anything very dissapointing as my trip was suppose to just be relaxing without my children also bed was so soft didnt sleep well at all
 arrived at 11am paid to upgrade the room to the 12th floor allocated a room number and signed for it arrived back at 5pm the room had been given to someone else ended up in a smaller room on the 10th floor with an excellent view of the window cleaning machine i felt that was unprofessional behaviour for a london hotel
 the air condition in the room made us sick it is impossible to adjust to avoid cold air directly on the bed 
 it was very noisy in the street in the middle of the night i wonder if the noise is from the collection of waste rubbish or some kind of road work 
 the room was uncomfortably warm disappointing breakfast buffet some grumpy staff at breakfast bathroom could have been cleaner
 it s a little dated decor wise the air conditioning was ancient and didn t work properly the windows could be opened into the street but that s noisy foyer is old and tired looking 
 elevator is very small 
 the room was very noisy as it was facing a busy intersection also acess to the terrace was limited as guests of the hotel cannot reserve a table on the terrace and it is very busy 
 room too warm upon arrival 
 check in process was very difficult long and late room was only available from 3pm not 2pm as stated on booking some staff had a poor attitude
 no mini bar
 at our 2 nights stay there was neither heating nor warm water the second night no excuse or offer for a partly refund of this night was made by the staff that seemed even annoyed furthermore at our departure we had to pay for a breakfast we didn t take apart from that we were satisfied with accomodation and services 
 rooms rather small and dark sharp corners on beds reception gave bad restaurant recommendations 
 old tawels
 my room on the 8th floor has only small windows which located high above eye level i felt like staying in a dungeon 
 breakfast very limited and boring they never change it i had to haven the same breakfast for 2 weeks nothing changed at all not even the plates position
 nil
 not much choice on evening menu
 the pillows on the bed were stuffed with rags and the staff were rude
 difficult to find not well signposted at all ok with sat nav though 
 the breakfast service needs more staff to service the guests particularly during rush hours
 the gym was very dated it wasn t as big as i thought it would be 
 actually i love the hotel and this is not the first time i chose them but when i came last time i was shock the employee that she work in the reception wasn t nice at all with me and she didn t treat me well 
 lots of mosqutos in the room
 location is far from tourist attractins
 room key cards don t always work first time when opening the door
 we got moved around from vondel to two other properties
 without prior notice there was no water to wash or shower which was totally unacceptable had to go without water for several hours missed my doctors appointment this is not good for a hotel 
 prolonged checki in time
 bed slipped on hard flooring minor detail 
 too expensive and staff tried to upgrade us to a room with no external window
 bed to small
 speed of service in the bar in the morning
 there were several things lacking no refrigerator no microwave claimed to have internet but never worked even after contacting the front desk room was nice and clean but pretty small they show many beautiful rooms on the internet but our room wasn t even half as nice as the pictured rooms 
 rooms on top floor very warm
 would like to have had access to electrical outlet adapters on site 
 dreadful internet really slow and continually dropped off line staff tried to fix the issue but disabled all of the security settings and made it worse 
 room was slightly on the small side to compared to other double rooms we ve stayed in at similar size london hotels
 bed was hard and the heating was stuck on 25 degrees and couldn t be turned down when i asked at reception the best they could do was open a window 
 nothing special soundproof is little poor and closet is minimum but they are not problem 
 nothing
 view from bedroom window kept the patterned curtains closed so did not have to see out
 no sting in the tail
 pilows
 everything was great 
 some of the staff at breakfast were not the best but all of the senior staff were top notch 
 i liked pretty much everything 
 mattresses are a bit hard and comfortable 
 the bar on night is very busy and even if you are staying at the hotel it might be difficult to get a table 
 it would have been nice to have an extra blanket and different pillows in the closet 
 the temporay parking space in front of the hotel for luggage load unload is very small no way to do it if there are 2 cars at the same time
